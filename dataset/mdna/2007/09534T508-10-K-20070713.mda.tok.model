item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background of the stock option investigation  findings  restatement of consolidated financial statements  remedial measures and related proceedings  and item a  controls and procedures in our annual report on form k for the year ended april   and item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background of the stock option investigation  findings  restatement of consolidated financial statements  remedial measures and related proceedings  and item  controls and procedures  on form q for the quarter ended january   each of which was filed with the sec on march  the internal review  the independent investigation  and related activities which led to our march restatement have required us to incur substantial expenses for legal  accounting  tax and other professional services  and have diverted management s attention from our business 
as of april   these expenses totaled approximately million  and certain of these expenses and activities have continued 
such continued expenses and activities include those relating to our may tender offer  resolution of international issues  including taxes  and our continued representation in connection with the litigation and investigatory proceedings 
the matters addressed in the march restatement have exposed us to greater risks associated with litigation  regulatory proceedings and government enforcement actions 
as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  multiple derivative complaints have been filed in state and federal courts against our directors and certain of our executive officers pertaining to allegations relating to stock option grants  and certain proceedings with respect to such matters are ongoing at the sec and the us attorney s office for the northern district of california 
we may become the subject of  or otherwise required to incur legal fees and costs in connection with  additional private litigation  regulatory proceedings  or government enforcement actions in connection with the march restatement 
no assurance can be given regarding the outcomes from such activities or that such outcomes will be consistent with the findings of our special committee reported in our annual report on form k for the year ended april  the resolution of these matters has been and will continue to be  time consuming  expensive  and will distract management from the conduct of our business 
our available directors and officers liability insurance may not be sufficient to cover our legal expenses or those of persons we are obligated to indemnify 
furthermore  if we are subject to adverse findings in litigation  regulatory proceedings or government enforcement actions  we could be required to pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed  which could harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  the march restatement and the related litigation and regulatory proceedings and any negative outcome that may occur from them could impact our relationships with customers and our ability to generate future net revenue 
our acquisitions may not provide the anticipated benefits and may disrupt our existing business 
we have acquired businesses in the past  such as our acquisition of permeo technologies  inc permeo  on march   and our acquisition of certain assets of the netcache business from network appliance  on september   and likely will acquire other businesses in the future 
there is no guaranty that such acquisitions will yield the anticipated benefits 
the success of any acquisition is impacted by a number of factors  and may be subject to the following risks our inability to successfully integrate the operations  technologies  products and personnel of the acquired companies  diversion of management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  loss of key employees of acquired companies  and substantial transaction costs 

table of contents acquisitions may also result in risks to our existing business  including dilution of our current stockholders percentage ownership through the issuance of new equity  assumption of additional liabilities  incurrence of additional debt or a decline in available cash  adverse affects to our financial statements  such as the need to make large and immediate one time write offs  the incurrence of restructuring and other related expenses  liability for intellectual property infringement and other litigation claims  and creation of goodwill or other intangible assets that could result in significant amortization expense 
the occurrence of any of the above risks could seriously harm our business 
we issued a combination of stock and cash in the permeo and netcache transactions  and in the private placement of preferred stock from which we funded a portion of the netcache transaction 
the issuance of stock in these transactions diluted our existing stockholders 
we also used million and million in cash as consideration in the permeo and netcache transactions  respectively 
we may not be able to successfully manage the growth of our business if we are unable to improve our internal systems  processes and controls 
our growth  as well as recent regulatory requirements and changes in financial standards  has placed demands on our management and our infrastructure 
we need to continue to improve our internal systems  processes and controls to effectively manage our operations and growth  including our international growth into new geographies 
we may not be able to successfully implement improvements to these systems  processes and controls in a timely or efficient manner  and we may discover deficiencies in existing systems  processes and controls 
our failure to improve our systems  processes and controls may result in our inability to manage the growth of our business and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
our products protect web based applications and content  and are focused on the internet gateway as the point of entry into the network 
our target customers may not wish to purchase our appliances without protection for non web based applications and content or may not use the internet gateway as a principal point of network entry 
our appliances are specially designed to secure web based protocols  such as http  https  ftp and streaming and focus on the internet gateway as the point of entry into the network 
while we believe that the majority of traffic traveling over the networks of our target customers is web based  a significant amount of our target customers network traffic may not be web based 
our products do not protect non web protocols 
if our target customers do not wish to purchase a product that handles network traffic that utilizes web based protocols or do not wish to use the internet gateway as a principal point of entry into their respective networks  our target customers may not purchase our products and our growth could be limited 
we rely on technology that we license from third parties  including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used with our products 
we rely on technology that we license from third parties  including software that is used with certain of our products 
if we are unable to continue to license any of this software on commercially reasonable terms  we will face delays in releases of our software or we will be required to delete this functionality from our software until equivalent technology can be licensed or developed and integrated into our current product 
in addition  the inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights might require us to engage in litigation regarding these matters  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
any of these delays could seriously harm our business 

table of contents undetected product errors  or failures found in new products may result in a loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products  which could cause us to incur significant costs  reduce our sales or result in litigation 
our products may contain undetected operating errors when first introduced or as new versions are released 
despite testing by us and by current and potential customers  errors may not be found in new products or new versions until after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance  which could materially adversely affect our operating results 
these errors may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs  divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems 
in addition  all of our products operate on our internally developed operating system 
as a result  any error in the operating system will affect all of our products 
we have experienced minor errors in the past in connection with new products and enhancements to existing products 
we expect that errors will be found from time to time in new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments  which could seriously harm our business 
since our end user customers install our appliances directly into their network infrastructures  any errors  defects or other performance problems with our products could negatively impact their networks or other internet users  resulting in financial or other losses 
while we typically seek by contract to limit our exposure to damages  it is possible that such limitations might not exist or might not be enforced in the event of a product liability claim 
moreover  a product liability claim brought against us  even if not successful  would likely be time consuming and costly and could seriously harm our business reputation 
we are the target of various litigation and regulatory proceedings  which could result in substantial costs  divert management attention and resources  and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position 
as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we are a party to various litigation  including class action litigation arising out of our initial public offering in and derivative actions arising out of allegedly misleading statements about our prospects made between february  and may   which actions were subsequently amended to seek relief on our behalf from certain defendants with respect to our historical stock option practices 
as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  in july  we are  or have been  the subject of various inquiries and investigations conducted by the sec  the us attorney s office for the northern district of california  the nasd  and a chicago board options exchange 
any material litigation and regulatory proceedings inevitably result in the diversion of our management s attention and an expenditure of our resources 
as well  any adverse result could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
if the protection of our proprietary technology is inadequate  our competitors may gain access to our technology  and our market share could decline 
our success is heavily dependent on our ability to create proprietary technology and to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights in that technology  as well as our ability to defend against adverse claims of third parties with respect to our technology and intellectual property 
to protect our proprietary technology  we rely primarily on a combination of contractual provisions  confidentiality procedures  trade secrets  copyright and trademark laws  and patents 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate and unauthorized third parties  including our competitors  may independently develop similar or superior technology  duplicate or reverse engineer aspects of our products  or design around our patented technology or other intellectual property 

table of contents we presently have issued us patents  pending us patent applications provisional and non provisional  and pending foreign patent application 
there can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will issue or that the patent examination process will not result in our narrowing the claims applied for 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that we will be able to detect any infringement of our existing or future patents if any  or  if infringement is detected  that our patents will be enforceable or that any damages awarded to us will be sufficient to adequately compensate us 
there can be no assurance or guarantee that any products  services or technologies that we are presently developing  or will develop in the future  will result in intellectual property that is protectable under law  whether in the united states or a foreign jurisdiction  that such intellectual property will produce competitive advantage for us  or that the intellectual property of competitors will not restrict our freedom to operate or put us at a competitive disadvantage 
third parties could assert that our products infringe their intellectual property rights 
third parties may claim that our current or future products infringe their intellectual property rights  and these claims  whether they have merit or not  could harm our business by increasing our costs  reducing our net revenue or by creating customer concerns that result in reduced sales 
this is particularly true in the patent area  as an increasing number of us patents covering computer networking and internet technology have been issued in recent years 
patent owners may claim that one or more of our products infringes a patent held by the claimant 
for example  as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  on march   esoft  inc filed a complaint for patent infringement against us in the us district court for the district of colorado  alleging infringement of its us patent  the patent and seeking unspecified monetary damages  as well as an injunction against future infringements 
we expect that companies in the internet and networking industries will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
any claims  including the esoft claim  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all  which could seriously harm our business 
the market price of our stock is volatile  and is likely to be volatile in the future 
since our initial public offering  the market price of our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and is likely to continue to fluctuate significantly 
such volatility in the trading price of our stock can occur in response to general market conditions and cause an increase or decline in our stock price without regard to our operating performance  as well as in response to changes in our business or the it or technology market generally 
the market price of our common stock could decline quickly and significantly if we fail to achieve our guidance or if our performance fails to meet the expectation of public market analysts or investors 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors  among others variations in our quarterly operating results  changes in financial estimates or investment recommendations by securities analysts  changes in macroeconomic conditions  the introduction of new products by our competitors  our ability to keep pace with changing technological requirements  changes in market valuations of internet related and networking companies  
table of contents announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  loss of a major customer  additions or departures of key personnel  fluctuations in stock market volumes  investor confidence in our stock  technology stocks and the stock market in general  speculation in the press or investment communication about our strategic position  financial condition  results of operations  or business  and significant transactions 
it is not uncommon for securities class action or other litigation to be brought against a company after periods of volatility in the market price of a company s stock  and we have been subject to such litigation in the past 
such actions could result in management distraction and expense and  further  result in a decline in our stock price 
our business is subject to increasingly complex corporate governance  public disclosure  accounting  and tax requirements that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance 
because our common stock is publicly traded  we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal  state  and other entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded 
these entities  including the public company accounting oversight board  the sec  and nasdaq  have implemented new requirements and regulations and are continuing to develop additional regulations and requirements in response to recent corporate scandals and laws enacted by congress  most notably the sarbanes oxley act of our efforts to comply with these new regulations have resulted in  and are likely to continue resulting in  increased general and administrative expenses and diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
we recently completed our evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of although our assessment  testing  and evaluation resulted in our conclusion that  as of april   our internal controls over financial reporting were effective  we cannot predict the outcome of our testing in future periods 
if our internal controls are ineffective in future periods  our business and reputation could be harmed 
we may incur additional expenses and commitment of management s time in connection with further evaluations  which could materially increase our operating expenses and  accordingly  reduce our net income 
the interpretation and application of new and modified laws  regulations  and standards may evolve over time  as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies and by court decisions 
this evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices 
we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets 
our products are subject to us export controls and may be exported outside the us only with the required level of export license or through an export license exception  because we incorporate encryption technology into our products 
in addition  various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our customers ability to implement our products in those countries 
changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets  prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products globally or  in some cases  prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether 
any change in export or import regulations or related legislation  
table of contents shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations  or change in the countries  persons or technologies targeted by such regulations  could result in decreased use of our products by  or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to  existing or potential customers with international operations 
any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
our operations could be significantly hindered by the occurrence of a natural disaster  terrorist attack or other catastrophic event 
our business operations are susceptible to outages due to fire  floods  power loss  telecommunications failures  terrorist attacks and other events beyond our control 
in addition  a substantial portion of our facilities  including our headquarters  are located in northern california  an area susceptible to earthquakes 
we do not carry earthquake insurance for earthquake related losses 
despite our implementation of network security measures  our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses  break ins  and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems 
we may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur as a result of any of these events 
to the extent that such events disrupt our business or adversely impact our reputation  such events could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
the legal environment in which we operate is uncertain and claims against us could cause our business to suffer 
our products operate in part by storing material available on the internet and making this material available to end users from our appliance 
as well  our appliance may be used to block content from being accessed 
this creates the potential for claims to be made against us  either directly or through contractual indemnification provisions with our customers  for defamation  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement  personal injury  censorship  invasion of privacy or other legal theories based on the nature  content or copying of this content 
as of april   we have not accrued any liabilities relating to indemnification provisions with our customers 
it is also possible that if any information provided through any of our products contains errors  third parties could make claims against us for losses incurred in reliance on this information 
our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or be adequate to protect us from all liability that may be imposed 
we have incurred and may continue to incur  in future periods  significant stock based compensation charges under sfas no 
r  which may adversely affect our reported financial results 
on may   we adopted the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb  which requires the measurement of all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of income 
the adoption of the sfas no 
r fair value method resulted in our recording of million in non cash stock based compensation expense in fiscal although we anticipate that our adoption of sfas no 
r will continue to adversely impact our reported results of operations  future changes to the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our equity awards  and the amount and type of those equity awards  will impact the expense recorded in any given period

overview when we began trading in the public market in november as cacheflow  inc  our business was focused on web application caching  a technology designed to enhance the performance of web based applications 
over time we repositioned the focus of our proxy appliances to that of controlling and securing web based communications 
we changed our name to blue coat systems  inc in to reflect the change in our business strategy 
today  we are a leader in the secure internet gateway market  and aspire to be the leading provider of wide area network wan application delivery products 
the wan application delivery market addresses the convergence of the wan security and wan optimization and acceleration markets  as it administrators are increasingly required to manage both functions 
the wan application delivery market is projected to grow substantially 
we believe that our leadership position in the secure internet gateway market  together with our underlying caching technology and expertise  can effectively be leveraged in the wan application delivery market and that our existing installed base of proxy appliances  together with the technical capabilities of those appliances  provides a strong foundation from which to achieve a leadership position in the wan application delivery market 
while we are a leader in the secure internet gateway market and anticipate continued growth and strong revenue from this business  we believe that we will not be able to sustain our prior rates of revenue growth by focusing principally on this market 
therefore  we have shifted a major portion of the emphasis of our research and development to activities supporting products for the wan application delivery market 
we commercially released our first generation wan application delivery product with our proxysg release in may  and in april we released our first proxysg client for wan application delivery 
in fiscal  we are shifting our focus to further enhance our proxysg appliance and our proxysg client software 
we intend to commit the majority of our research and development activities to the development of our wan application 
table of contents delivery products  including adding functionality to remain competitive with products offered by others and adding and enhancing functionality which differentiates our products 
we believe that our established reputation in the security field  and our emphasis on secure content and application delivery  differentiates us from our competitors in the wan application delivery market 
although we are a relatively new entrant in the market  we have substantial application acceleration capabilities through our past focus on caching technology and application protocol optimization which are two of the techniques we currently use to improve wan performance 
we also believe that our technology and mach product architecture provides us with a key competitive advantage in growing our revenue in this market 
however  in order for us to be successful in the wan application delivery market  which is populated by better known companies and brands  it will be imperative that we build market awareness of our products and our participation in the market  both with respect to our installed base and with respect to potential new customers 
as well  it is critical to our success that our efforts to expand our sales force and to create incentives to drive sales of wan application delivery products result in increased sales productivity and revenue 
we intend to commit substantial resources in fiscal to directed sales and marketing activities designed to create increased brand awareness and recognition of our capabilities in the wan application delivery market and to increase our market share in the wan application delivery market 
the growth of our business is dependent on growth in our target markets  particularly growth in the wan application delivery market 
this  in turn  is dependent on continued growth in it discretionary spending on a global basis 
in fiscal year  of our sales were in north america and of our sales were in countries outside of north america  and in the fourth quarter of  of our sales were in north america and of our sales were in countries outside of north america 
some analysts have predicted a softening in it spending and  should that occur  it will be difficult for us to achieve our projected revenue growth 
we believe that the web will increasingly become the central means of communication for business enterprises  both with respect to use of the internet and for business application use and delivery  and that the continued growth of the web as a means of business communication will drive the need for better security and speed of web based transmission 
we have built our business model and strategy and our product architecture based on those premises 
we believe that we will see continued convergence in the markets for products that provide wan security and those that provide wan acceleration or wan optimization 
we believe that over time this convergence will result in the merging of our internet gateway security products and our wan application delivery products  and provide us with a unique competitive advantage over our competitors 
however  we also expect that we will see increasing competition in the wan application delivery market  particularly from larger competitors with well established brands and reputations  and that this competition may adversely impact our prices and margins 
we are focused on developing products for mid to large size enterprises  which we define to include organizations with several thousand users to organizations with tens of thousand of users 
we believe this focus helps us to rapidly identify and target attractive market opportunities 
in support of this focus  we are directing our principal product development  marketing and sales activities to that enterprise market segment 
we believe the market for these enterprises represents our most attractive revenue growth opportunity  given the demonstrated need for wan application delivery products  the opportunity to sell to numerous customers  and the level of existing competition
