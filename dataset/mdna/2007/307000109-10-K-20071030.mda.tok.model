the various components affecting our results for fiscal are discussed in more detail in results of operations below 
during fiscal  we focused our efforts on these key initiatives designed to support sustainable and profitable growth we continued to expand our food strategy 
we installed refrigerated coolers in approximately  stores  and at the end of fiscal  approximately  of our stores had coolers for the sale of refrigerated food

in addition  we installed technology to facilitate the acceptance of food stamps in approximately stores

to improve the profitability and performance of our new stores  we continued to refine our site selection process and increased our cross functional focus on new store performance 
we stabilized and improved the performance of new stores as we managed a more even flow of monthly openings and increased our cross functional support of new stores 
in support of our concept renewal efforts  we opened or renovated test stores in charlotte  north carolina 
in addition  of the new stores opened during fiscal  were opened in the concept renewal format 

table of contents to optimize our merchandising and supply chain processes  we launched a multi year initiative called project accelerate 
as a result of this initiative  we instituted a stronger category management framework for merchandising decisions 
using this framework  we restructured our merchandising and supply chain organization  creating category teams with clearly defined roles for each category 
we also created groups of operational specialists  like our pricing group  to provide our buyers with institutional expertise 
fiscal outlook fiscal will be a week year  compared with a week year in fiscal the second quarter of fiscal will include weeks compared with weeks in the second quarter of fiscal during fiscal  we plan to focus our efforts on the following key initiatives to capture more of our customers frequent fill in food trips  we will continue the roll out of our food strategy 
we plan to complete the cooler roll out with the installation of refrigerated coolers in approximately additional stores  and we expect to expand the selling space for food in approximately  additional stores 
we also plan to install technology to facilitate the acceptance of food stamps in approximately  additional stores 
we plan to continue to develop and refine our treasure hunt strategy 
for example  in the home and apparel categories  we will continue to focus on providing our customers with a better assortment of quality family apparel and home d cor at attractive values 
we are also simplifying our promotional planning to make it easier for store associates to create exciting events for our customers and to better manage residual inventory 
the continued development of our global sourcing group will play a significant role in our success as we strengthen our quality and value proposition in these categories 
we also plan to continue to selectively leverage national brands within our treasure hunt categories 
our concept renewal effort has allowed us to test new ideas in store layout and design with the goal of enhancing the customers shopping experience 
we intend to evaluate several renovation strategies to assess the impact of incorporating the concept renewal elements in existing stores 
using our test stores  we will also begin to explore new ideas intended to make stores easier to operate and shop 
we will continue our measured pace of new store openings so that we can continue to strengthen our support of new stores while also improving returns in our existing stores 
we expect to open up to stores and close approximately stores 
as part of our store of the future project  we plan to roll out new point of sale technology in approximately  stores 
we will continue to optimize our merchandising and supply chain processes through our project accelerate initiative 
we plan to incorporate our category management framework into our planning  buying and logistical processes  and we recently installed a new merchandising and financial planning tool that should result in greater visibility to underlying trends to support more timely responses 
we also plan to continue the development of our price optimization processes and our assortment planning capabilities 
as previously noted  fiscal will be a week year  compared with a week year in fiscal for fiscal  we expect comparable store sales to increase to from the comparable week period in fiscal we expect to see continued improvement in cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  as we continue to develop our treasure hunt strategy and project accelerate initiative  as well as our global sourcing efforts 
we believe these improvements will mitigate the pressures from the implementation of our food strategy 
we expect selling  general and administrative sg a expenses  as a percentage of net sales  will be primarily impacted by the level of comparable store sales growth as we continue to pursue our investments in key initiatives 
based on these factors  we currently expect diluted net income per common share will be between and for fiscal  compared to in fiscal 
table of contents results of operations net sales our net sales in fiscal were billion  an increase of approximately million  as compared with an increase of approximately million in fiscal the increases in fiscal and in fiscal were attributable  in part  to increased sales in comparable stores stores open more than months of million and million  respectively  with the balance of the increases primarily relating to sales from new stores opened as part of our store growth program 
fiscal also benefited from an extra week of sales due to the week year  as discussed above 
in fiscal  the customer count  as measured by the number of register transactions in comparable stores  decreased slightly  and the average customer transaction increased approximately to 
we continue to believe that our customer is consolidating trips in response to economic pressures and the volatility of gasoline prices 
in fiscal  the customer count decreased approximately and the average transaction increased approximately 
sales during fiscal were strongest in consumables  driven primarily by sales of food resulting from the implementation of our food strategy  and were weaker in apparel and accessories and home products 
sales of seasonal and electronics were impacted by increased sales of prepaid services  which are recorded on a net basis only the markup on the sales of these products is recorded as revenue 
see item business merchandise and marketing elsewhere in this report for a breakdown of the percentage of sales attributable to each product category during the last three fiscal years 
we distributed five advertising circulars in fiscal and four advertising circulars in both fiscal and fiscal the circulars are designed to stimulate traffic and inform customers about our treasure hunt merchandise  seasonal values and competitive prices on core consumables 
during fiscal  we opened stores and closed stores for a net addition of stores  compared with the opening of stores and closing of stores for a net addition of stores during fiscal we also expanded or relocated stores in fiscal  compared with stores that were expanded or relocated in fiscal in addition  we renovated stores in fiscal  compared with stores that were renovated in fiscal cost of sales cost of sales increased approximately million in fiscal compared with fiscal and approximately million in fiscal compared with fiscal these increases primarily reflected the additional sales volume in each of the years 
cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  during fiscal  was due to the effect of an increase in sales of prepaid services  which are reported on a net basis  as discussed above  a more favorable merchandise sales mix  better merchandise markup and lower inventory shrinkage 
these improvements were partially offset by higher markdown expense 
freight expense  as a percentage of net sales  was substantially unchanged 
the merchandise sales mix and the merchandise markup were positively impacted by our treasure hunt strategy and price optimization efforts related to our project accelerate initiative 
we continue to focus on improving inventory productivity  through the continued refinement of our inventory replenishment system and the implementation of a more aggressive markdown strategy 
the improvements in inventory shrinkage resulted from stronger inventory productivity  better visibility and store manager retention trends 
the decrease in cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  during fiscal compared with fiscal was due primarily to a more favorable merchandise sales mix  better merchandise markup and improved inventory shrinkage 
these improvements were partially offset by higher freight costs resulting from higher fuel costs 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses increased approximately million in fiscal compared with fiscal  and approximately million in fiscal compared with fiscal the increases in these expenses were attributable primarily to additional costs arising from the continued growth in the number of stores in operation 
sg a expenses  as a percentage of net sales  were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal as a result of low single digit comparable store sales growth and the effect of an increase in sales of prepaid services  most costs in fiscal increased as a percentage of net sales 
increased professional fees approximately of net sales and increased occupancy costs approximately of net sales were partially offset by a decrease in insurance costs approximately of net sales 
the increase in professional fees  as a percentage of net sales  was due primarily to expenses associated with the defense and settlement of certain stockholder derivative actions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on the defense and settlement of the stockholder derivative actions 
the increase in occupancy costs  as a percentage of net sales  was due to higher store rental expenses primarily property tax  insurance and common area maintenance reimbursements and increased store maintenance  repair and utility expenses 
in the future  we expect to mitigate against increases in occupancy costs through improvements in facilities management processes 
the decrease in insurance costs  as a percentage of net sales  was due to favorable trends in workers compensation and healthcare claims 
we believe that improvements in processes  lower inventory levels and increased store manager retention rates are contributing to the favorable trend in workers compensation claims 
the increase in sg a expenses  as a percentage of net sales  in fiscal compared with fiscal was due primarily to increased compensation expense related to the expensing of stock based compensation as a result of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised share based payment sfas r and an increase in annual bonus compensation  increased utility costs and a cumulative charge to adjust non cash stock based compensation expense in connection with the review of our stock option granting practices 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in store payroll expenses 
in addition  most other costs decreased as a percentage of net sales as a result of improved cost control and comparable store sales growth 
litigation charge during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million a net impact of approximately per diluted share litigation charge associated with an adverse litigation judgment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information 
all other legal expenses during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  including our defense costs related to the above referenced case  were recorded in sg a 
interest income interest income increased approximately million in fiscal compared with fiscal and approximately million in fiscal compared with fiscal the increase in both years was due to an increase in interest rates and an increase in investment securities 
interest expense interest expense increased approximately million in fiscal compared with fiscal the increase in interest expense during fiscal was due primarily to interest on taxes resulting from the internal revenue service examination of our consolidated federal income tax returns for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal and interest on state income taxes 
we did not incur any interest expense during fiscal interest expense during fiscal million was primarily due to interest in connection with the issuance of million of long term debt on september  
table of contents income taxes the effective tax rate was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal compared with fiscal was a result of the positive impact of a retroactive reinstatement of federal jobs tax credits  an increase in tax exempt interest income  and the effect of changes in reserves for state income tax contingencies 
the increase in the effective rate in fiscal compared with fiscal was a result of the effect of changes in state income taxes and the expiration of certain federal jobs tax credits for employees hired after december  liquidity and capital resources we have consistently maintained a strong liquidity position 
cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was million as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal these amounts have enabled us to fund our regular operating needs  capital expenditure program  cash dividend payments  and interest payments  as well as a significant portion of our share repurchases 
we maintain an unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders for borrowings of up to million 
the credit facility is generally used to meet any short term liquidity needs resulting from seasonal inventory purchases 
the credit facility expires on august  any borrowings under the credit facility accrue interest at a variable rate based on short term market interest rates 
outstanding standby letters of credit reduce the borrowing capacity of the credit facility 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we borrowed million under the credit facility in response to short term liquidity needs resulting from the formation of our captive insurance subsidiary 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on the formation of the captive insurance subsidiary 
the amounts borrowed under the credit facility were outstanding for a weighted average period of approximately six days 
as of the end of fiscal  there were no borrowings under the credit facility 
we had no borrowings against our credit facilities during fiscal or fiscal the credit facility contains certain restrictive financial covenants  which include a consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization ratio  a fixed charge coverage ratio  and a priority debt to consolidated net worth ratio 
as of the end of fiscal  we were in compliance with all such covenants 
merchandise inventories at the end of fiscal were higher than at the end of fiscal the increase in merchandise inventories was due primarily to the additional inventory resulting from net new stores 
inventory on a per store basis at the end of fiscal was approximately lower than at the end of fiscal  excluding merchandise in transit to the distribution centers 
the decrease in inventory on a per store basis during fiscal resulted from our continued focus on inventory productivity 
during fiscal  we continued to refine our centralized replenishment system to improve in stock levels for basic merchandise and continued our aggressive markdown strategy to effectively manage our fashion merchandise 
we also improved inventory turns for the second straight year 
inventory on a per store basis at the end of fiscal was approximately lower than at the end of fiscal  excluding merchandise in transit to the distribution centers 
we believe that the decreases in store inventory levels over the past two years are positively impacting merchandise presentation  inventory shrinkage and store manager retention trends 
the decrease in capital expenditures to million in fiscal from million in fiscal was due primarily to the decrease in the number of new stores opened during fiscal as compared to fiscal and lower distribution and transportation investments 
offsetting some of the decrease was an increase in expenditures related to technology investments 
capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be between and million and relate primarily to new store openings  existing store expansions  relocations and renovations  distribution center improvements  expenditures related to technology infrastructure investments  and the continued implementation of our refrigerated cooler program for perishable goods in selected stores 
the new store expansion will require additional investment in merchandise inventories 
capital spending plans  including store opening plans  are continuously reviewed and are subject to change 
cash flow from current operations is expected to be sufficient to meet planned liquidity and operational capital resource needs  including store expansion and other capital spending programs 
in addition  as previously discussed  we have available a revolving credit facility 

table of contents during fiscal  we purchased million shares of our common stock at a cost of million 
the shares were purchased in the open market or pursuant to rule b of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
during fiscal  we purchased million shares at a cost of million  and during fiscal  we purchased million shares at a cost of million 
as of september   we had outstanding authorizations to purchase a total of approximately million shares 
we purchased the million remaining shares during the first quarter of fiscal cash flows from operating activities during fiscal  cash provided by operating activities decreased million compared to fiscal primarily due to changes in merchandise inventories and other working capital items in the ordinary course of business 
merchandise inventories at the end of fiscal were higher than at the end of fiscal merchandise inventories at the end of fiscal were lower than at the end of fiscal the change in the deferred tax asset and the income tax refund receivable relate primarily to changes in the tax deductibility of insurance loss reserves in connection with the formation of the captive insurance subsidiary 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on the formation of the captive insurance subsidiary 
cash flows from investing activities cash used for investing activities decreased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to the decrease in capital expenditures as discussed above 
cash flows from financing activities cash used in financing activities increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase was primarily a result of a change in the financing of stock repurchases 
during fiscal  the repurchases of common stock were financed through the use of operating cash flows while a significant portion of the repurchases of common stock during fiscal were financed through the issuance of long term debt 
the increase was partially offset by an increase in the cash overdrafts as a result of the timing of payments at year end 
the following table shows our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations at the end of fiscal payments due during the period ending contractual obligations in thousands total august august august august august thereafter long term debt interest merchandise letters of credit operating leases construction obligations minimum royalties total at the end of fiscal  approximately million of the merchandise letters of credit were included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet

table of contents critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management 
our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information  historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following accounting principles are critical because they involve significant judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
merchandise inventories our inventories are valued using the retail method  based on retail prices less mark on percentages  which approximates the lower of first in  first out fifo cost or market 
we record adjustments to inventory through cost of goods sold when retail price reductions  or markdowns  are taken against on hand inventory 
in addition  we make estimates and judgments regarding  among other things  initial markups  markdowns  future demand for specific product categories and market conditions  all of which can significantly impact inventory valuation 
these estimates and judgments are based on the application of a consistent methodology each period 
while we believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for these components  if actual demand or market conditions are different than our projections  it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded estimates 
this risk is generally higher for seasonal merchandise than for non seasonal merchandise 
we estimate inventory losses for damaged  lost or stolen inventory inventory shrinkage for the period from the most recent physical inventory to the financial statement date 
the accrual for estimated inventory shrinkage is based on the trailing twelve month actual inventory shrinkage rate 
there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions related to the valuation of inventory during fiscal property and equipment we state property and equipment at cost 
we calculate depreciation for financial reporting purposes using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets 
for leasehold improvements  this depreciation is over the shorter of the term of the related lease generally five years or the asset s useful economic life 
the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciable lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates 
we generally do not assign salvage value to property and equipment 
we review property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
historically  our impairment losses on fixed assets  which typically relate to normal store closings  have not been material to our financial position and results of operations 
there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions related to the valuation and classification of property and equipment during fiscal insurance liabilities we are primarily self insured for health care  property loss  workers compensation  and general liability costs 
these costs are significant primarily due to the large number of our retail locations and associates 
because the nature of these claims is such that there can be a significant lag from the incurrence of the claim which is when the expense is accrued until payment is made  the percentage increase in the accrual can be much more pronounced than the percentage increase in the expense 
our self insurance liabilities are based on the total estimated costs of claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported  less amounts paid against such claims  and are not discounted 
we review current and historical claims data in developing our estimates 
we also use information provided by outside actuaries with respect to medical  workers compensation and general liability claims 
the insurance liabilities we record are mainly influenced by changes in payroll expense  sales  number of vehicles  and the frequency and severity of claims 
the estimates of more recent 
table of contents claims are more volatile and more likely to change than older claims 
if the underlying facts and circumstances of the claims change or the historical trend is not indicative of future trends  then we may be required to record additional expense or a reduction to expense which could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we formed family dollar insurance  inc  a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary based in south carolina  to insure our retained workers compensation  general liability and automobile liability risks 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information 
there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions used to determine insurance liabilities during fiscal contingent income tax liabilities we are subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business 
our contingent income tax liabilities are estimated based on an assessment of the probability of the income tax related exposures and settlements and are influenced by our historical audit experiences with various state and federal taxing authorities as well as current income tax trends 
if circumstances change  we may be required to record adjustments that could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations 
there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions used to determine contingent income tax liabilities during fiscal contingent legal liabilities we are involved in numerous legal proceedings and claims 
our accruals  if any  related to these proceedings and claims are based on a determination of whether or not the loss is both probable and estimable 
we review outstanding claims and proceedings with external counsel to assess probability and estimates of loss 
we re evaluate the claims and proceedings each quarter or as new and significant information becomes available  and we adjust or establish accruals  if necessary 
if circumstances change  we may be required to record adjustments that could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations 
there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions used to determine contingent legal liabilities during fiscal stock based compensation expense we adopted sfas r during the first quarter of fiscal sfas r requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based awards made to employees based on estimated fair values 
the determination of the fair value of employee stock options on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
we also grant performance share rights and adjust compensation expense each quarter based on the ultimate number of shares expected to be issued 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  the compensation expense recorded under sfas r may differ significantly from the amount recorded in the current period 
there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions used to determine stock based compensation during fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on the company s adoption of sfas r 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing  investing and cash management activities 
we maintain an unsecured revolving credit facility at a variable rate of interest to meet the short term needs of our expansion program and seasonal inventory increases 
interest incurred during fiscal related to the credit facility was not material 
our long term debt bears interest at fixed rates
