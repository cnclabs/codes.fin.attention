overview we are a leading global developer and manufacturer of rapidly deployable  multi sensor chemical and radiation detection monitors and networks for industrial applications and homeland security 
in addition  we offer a full line of portable single sensor chemical and radiation detection products 
we were founded in to develop technologies for the detection and early warning of hazardous materials 
the market for our products has evolved from being strictly focused on environmental and industrial monitoring to now encompassing public safety and the threat of terrorism 
in conjunction with our acquisition of aegison corporation and formation of rae coal mine safety instruments fushun co  ltd  we expect to expand our presence to include the mobile in the mobile digital video security market in the united states and broader energy exploration and refining safety equipment market  especially as it applies to the coal mine safety equipment market in china 
in  we leveraged our expertise and experience to make two key investments in china to pursue opportunities in one of the world s largest and fastest growing economies 
first in july  we increased our ownership in rae beijing to percent to benefit from our efforts to drive higher revenue and operating profit at the consolidated subsidiary 
rae beijing produces  sells and distributes safety and security solutions for the chemical  oil  gas  metals and energy sectors in china 
second  in december  we formed rae fushun  a joint venture to capitalize on china s growing reliance on coal based energy resources 
rae fushun manufactures and sells coal mine safety equipment 
rae systems retains percent ownership and the joint venture combines our skill and expertise with fushun anyi  a former state owned company that we have had as a distribution partner for a number of years 
rae fushun offers a wide and well balanced range of safety products from personal safety equipment like headlamps  respiratory protection and portable gas detection to fixed  mine based safety systems such as permanently mounted mine wide gas detection systems and methane pump systems to degasify potentially explosive mines 
in july  we also invested in next generation mobile and wireless digital video technology by acquiring aegison corporation 
this transaction added two more patents to our intellectual property portfolio and creates the opportunity to offer new solutions to our law enforcement and other mobile video customers 
we have had a number of successful product deployments 
the arearae has been adopted as a standard for continuous monitoring of worker safety in the petrochemical industry during plant turnarounds 
we believe arearae provides a significant cost savings and productivity advantage for bringing facilities back on line more quickly 
national guard civil support teams have deployed over fifty seven arearae platforms at least one system for each state 
the gammarae ii r portable radiation detector dosimeter was selected and is being evaluated by the state of illinois as part of their large multi year radiation equipment procurement 

table of contents several chemical manufacturers  throughout europe  have selected the minirae and ppbrae plus pid instruments for industrial hygiene applications 
in china  we received a large order for raeguard fixed sensor systems from petrochina  dushanzi project 
we also received orders from several state operated oil fields including da gang  liao he  and the chang qing 
in early  we have strengthened and expanded our sales and distribution channels in each of our three geographic sales regions 
we continue to augment our sales model with the introduction of a value added reseller program  additional regional sales management and inside sales resources 
we have also added a direct sales component for key national and government accounts 
to accelerate transactions with our channel partners we are deploying a web portal for our value added resellers 
we are expanding our training programs to offer product and service training  and american industrial hygiene certification classes 
we expect to launch a number of additional new products for various global markets in in  our oil and gas customers have experienced success in deploying our wireless gas detection solutions in plant turnarounds 
one of our industrial targets for is to extend that success to the chemical plants in the gulf coast region of the us in india and the middle east we added additional regional sales managers to grow our presence in these two emerging markets 
in china  our focus is on the growing environmental protection market and the industrial sector  including oil and gas  petro chemicals  certain telecom applications and coal mining 
a major priority will be to introduce new products for the coal mine safety market through rae fushun 
we believe this market will provide us a number of exciting new business opportunities in and beyond  as china continues to modernize its coal mining industry 
in all of our markets we will continue to explore and develop strategic value added partnerships  to leverage our product and market expertise 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the estimates  including those related to our allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of goodwill and intangible assets  investments  valuation of deferred tax assets  restructuring costs  contingencies  inventory valuation  warranty accrual and stock based compensation expense 
in conjunction with acquisitions  we allocate investment costs based on the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments or estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
a provision for estimated product returns is established at the time of sale based upon historical return rates adjusted for current economic conditions 
historically  the company has experienced an insignificant amount of sales returns 
the company generally recognizes revenue when goods are shipped to its distributors in accordance with standard contract terms that pass title of all goods upon delivery to a common carrier fob factory and provides for sales returns under standard product warranty provisions 
for non standard contract terms where title to goods pass at time of delivery fob destination  revenue is recognized after the company has established proof of delivery 
revenues relating to services performed under the company s extended warranty program represent less than of net revenues in each 
table of contents of  and and are recognized as earned based upon contract terms  generally ratable over the term of service 
we record project installation work in asia using the percentage of completion method 
installation revenue represents less than of net revenue in  and net revenues include amounts billed to customers in sales transactions for shipping and handling  as prescribed by the emerging issues task force issue eitf no 
 accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs 
shipping fees represent less than of net revenues in each of  and shipping costs are included in cost of goods sold 
accounts receivable  trade notes receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts the company grants credit to its customers after undertaking an investigation of credit risk for all significant amounts 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is provided for estimated credit losses at a level deemed appropriate to adequately provide for known and inherent risks related to such amounts 
the allowance is based on reviews of loss  adjustments history  current economic conditions and other factors that deserve recognition in estimating potential losses 
the company generally does not require collateral for sales on credit 
while management uses the best information available in making its determination  the ultimate recovery of recorded accounts receivable is also dependent upon future economic and other conditions that may be beyond management s control 
if there was a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or if actual defaults were higher than what have been experienced historically  additional allowances would be required 
trade notes receivables are presented to the company from some of our customers in china as a payment against the outstanding trade receivables 
these notes receivables are bank guarantee promissory notes which are non interest bearing and generally mature within months 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  using the first in  first out method  or market 
the company is exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of its inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage  or saleable only for amounts that are less than their carrying amounts 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in the market  competitive pressures in products and prices  and the availability of key components from its suppliers 
the company has established inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that its inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon assumptions about future demand for its products and market conditions 
when recorded  reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of the inventory to its net realizable value 
if actual demand for specified products deteriorates  or market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional reserves may be required 
investments as a result of our investment commitments and in accordance with financial accounting standard  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity  the company changed the classification of its investments from held to maturity to available for sale 
the resulting fair value calculation of the company s investments led to a nominal net decrease in carrying value of the investments in stock based compensation expense effective january   the company adopted fas  accounting for stock based compensation  for the recognition of stock based compensation cost in its statement of operations 
the fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of the grant using the black scholes merton valuation method 
this fair value was amortized as compensation expense  on a straight line basis  over the requisite service periods of the awards  which was generally the vesting period 
effective january   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of fas revised  share based payment  where the fair value of each option is adjusted to reflect only those shares that are expected to vest 
the company s implementation of fas r uses the modified prospective transition method where the compensation cost related to each unvested option as of january   is recalculated and any necessary adjustment is reported in the first quarter of adoption 

table of contents the company made the following estimates and assumptions in determining fair value valuation and amortization method the company estimates the fair value of stock options granted using the black scholes merton option pricing formula and a single option award approach 
this fair value is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
expected term the company s expected term represents the period that the company s stock based awards are expected to be outstanding and was determined using the simplified method as defined in the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
expected volatility the company s expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the company s stock  adjusted where determined by management for unusual and non representative stock price activity not expected to recur 
expected dividend the black scholes merton valuation model calls for a single expected dividend yield as an input 
the company currently pays no dividends and does not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
risk free interest rate the company bases the risk free interest rate on the implied yield currently available on united states treasury zero coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term 
estimated forfeitures when estimating forfeitures  the company uses the average historical option forfeitures over a period of four years 
business combinations in accordance with business combination accounting  we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  liabilities assumed on their estimated fair values 
we engage third party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
such a valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from maintenance agreements  customer contracts  acquired developed technologies and pending patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates  foreign losses not benefited  non deductible stock compensation deductions under fas r and change provisions for uncertain tax positions 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates  by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities  or by changes in tax laws  regulations  accounting principles  or interpretations thereof 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available evidence including past operating 
table of contents results  estimates of future taxable income  and the feasibility of tax planning strategies 
in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized  we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion analyzes our disclosure to market risk related to concentration of credit risk  changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
concentration of credit risk currently  we have cash and cash equivalents deposited with one large united states financial institution  one large hong kong financial institution  three large shanghai financial institutions  one local beijing financial institutions  two large beijing financial institutions and one large danish financial institution 
our deposits may exceed the amount of insurance available to cover such deposits 
to date  we have not experienced any losses of deposits of cash and cash equivalents 
management regularly reviews our deposit amounts and the credit worthiness of the financial institution which hold our deposits 
interest rate risk as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million consisting of cash and highly liquid short term investments 
as a result of our investment commitments and in accordance with financial accounting standard  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity  the company changed the classification of its investments from held to maturity to available for sale 
the resulting fair value calculation of the company s investments led to a nominal net decrease in carrying value of the investments in in addition  changes to interest rates over time may reduce or increase our interest income from our short term investments 
if  for example  there is a hypothetical basis points  bps change in the interest rates in the united states  the approximate impact on our cash and short term investments would be foreign currency exchange rate risk for the year ended december   a substantial portion of our recognized revenue was denominated in us dollars generated primarily from customers in the americas 
revenue generated from our european operations was primarily in euros  revenue generated by our asia operations was primarily in the renminbi rmb 
we manufacture a majority of our component parts at our manufacturing facility in shanghai  china 
since january  our operations in china have been affected by currency fluctuations due to an approximate appreciation of the rmb relative to the us dollar 
our strategy has been and will continue to be to increase our overseas manufacturing and research and development activities to capitalize on low cost intellectual property and efficiency in supply chain management 
in and  we made a strategic investment in china with the acquisition of a interest in rae bejing  a beijing based manufacturer and distributor of environmental safety and security equipment 
we also formed rae coal mine safety instruments fushun co  ltd  in late to capitalize on increase in demand for safety equipment in the energy sector in china 
there has been continued speculation in the financial press that china s currency  the rmb  will be subject to a further market adjustment relative to the us dollar and other currencies 
if  for example  in there was a hypothetical change in the rmb relative to the us dollar  the approximate impact on our profits would have been approximately  for the fiscal year 
were the currencies in all other countries in europe and asia where we have operations to change in unison with the rmb by a hypothetical against the us dollar the approximate impact on our profits would be approximately  for the fiscal year 
the reduction in the impact of the rmb is due to the offset of changes in reported net sales in our other units resulting from changes in those countries local currencies 
furthermore  to the extent that we engage in international sales denominated in us dollars in countries other than china  any fluctuation in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could affect our competitive position in the international markets 
although we would continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations and  when appropriate  may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations  we cannot be certain that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial results in the future
