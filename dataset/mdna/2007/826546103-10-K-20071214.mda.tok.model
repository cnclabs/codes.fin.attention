in addition  in fiscal  the company and sifco turbine completed the sale of its large aerospace turbine engine component repair business and certain related assets large aero business 
the combined results of the company s industrial repair and large aero businesses are reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
net sales from continuing operations in fiscal increased to million  compared with million in fiscal income from continuing operations in fiscal was income of million  compared with a loss of million in fiscal income from discontinued operations  net of tax  which includes both the industrial repair and large aero businesses  was a loss of million in fiscal  compared to income of million in fiscal included in the million loss from discontinued operations in fiscal was i million of grant income related to the expiration of certain grants  as explained more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements in item and ii a loss of approximately million from the divestiture of the industrial repair business  as explained more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements in item included in the million of income from discontinued operations in fiscal was a gain of approximately million from the divestiture of the large aero business  as explained more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements in item net income in fiscal was million  compared with million in fiscal aerospace component manufacturing group acm group net sales in fiscal increased to million  compared with million in fiscal the significant increase in the acm group s net sales in fiscal was due to a combination of i an increase in volumes resulting from the general strength of demand in the markets which the company serves and ii an increase in product prices principally reflecting the pass through to customers of the increase in raw material prices incurred by the company 
for purposes of the following discussion  the acm group considers aircraft that can accommodate less than passengers to be small aircraft and those that can accommodate or more passengers to be large aircraft 
net sales of airframe components for small aircraft increased million to million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal net sales of turbine engine components for small aircraft  which consist primarily of net sales of turbine engine components for business and regional jets  as well as military transport and surveillance aircraft  increased million to million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal net sales of airframe components for large aircraft increased million to million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal net sales of turbine engine components for large aircraft decreased million to million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal commercial product and non product sales were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
included in net sales in fiscal was million related principally to certain product pricing adjustments that were agreed to and recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal and that related to customer shipments that occurred during the 
table of contents prior two quarters of fiscal such pricing adjustments resulted principally from the finalization  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  of certain acm group customer negotiations that were initiated during the first half of fiscal of the million in fourth quarter pricing adjustments  million related to net sales in the third quarter of fiscal and million related to net sales in the second quarter of fiscal the acm group s airframe and turbine engine component products have both military and commercial applications 
net sales of airframe and turbine engine components that solely have military applications were million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal this increase is attributable in part to increased military spending due to ongoing wartime demand such as for additional military helicopters and related replacement components 
in fiscal  the acm group s total material cost of goods sold as a percentage of net product sales decreased compared with fiscal availability of certain aerospace grade materials improved somewhat in fiscal  compared with fiscal  resulting in the beginning of the shortening of certain raw materials lead times 
during fiscal  the acm group s selling  general and administrative expense increased million to million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  in fiscal the million increase in fiscal was principally due to increases in the acm group s compensation expense  including incentive compensation  and variable selling costs resulting from i the hiring of certain additional personnel to support the growth in the acm group s business and ii the overall significant increase in net sales and operating income during fiscal compared with fiscal the acm group s operating income in fiscal was million  compared with million in fiscal operating results improved significantly in fiscal compared with fiscal due primarily to the positive impact on margins resulting from significantly higher production and net sales volumes in fiscal the improved margins are due principally to i operating efficiencies and the related absorption of the acm group s relatively high fixed operating costs over more units of production and sales in fiscal  ii improvements in product pricing and iii a million reduction in the lifo provision in fiscal compared with fiscal turbine component services and repair group repair group net sales from continuing operations in fiscal  which consist principally of component repair services including precision component machining and industrial coating for small aerospace turbine engines  increased to million  compared with million in fiscal during fiscal  the repair group s selling  general and administrative expenses from continuing operations decreased million to million or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  in fiscal included in the million of selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were million of severance and related charges 
the repair group s operating income from continuing operations in fiscal was million  compared with million in fiscal the improvement in operating income is principally attributable to i the aforementioned reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses  ii the relative product sales mix with a larger portion of sales being higher margin product with a lower raw material higher value added content and iii the consumption of lower cost and or previously written down inventory

net sales of airframe components for small aircraft increased million to million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal net sales of turbine engine components for small aircraft  which consist primarily of business aircraft and regional commercial jets  as well as military transport and surveillance aircraft  increased million to million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal net sales of airframe components for large aircraft increased million to million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal net sales of turbine engine components for large aircraft increased million to million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal the increase in the acm group s net sales volumes during fiscal is in part attributable to an increase in the acm group s selling prices due to increases in raw material prices in the market place  some of which were passed through to the acm group s customers 
the commercial aerospace industry continues to experience strong demand  most notably for mid size single aisle aircraft as well as for regional aircraft 
other product and non product sales were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the acm group s airframe and turbine engine component products have both military and commercial applications 
net sales of airframe and turbine engine components that solely have military applications were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
this increase is attributable in part to increased military spending due to ongoing wartime demand such as for additional military helicopters 
in fiscal  the acm group s total material cost of goods sold as a percentage of net product sales increased  compared with fiscal overall steel capacity was tight during fiscal  especially for aerospace grade materials 
titanium pricing is impacted by limited world wide supply of titanium 
these factors  coupled with increased steel demand  have resulted in higher raw material prices 
while all grades of raw material experienced cost increases during fiscal  aerospace alloy and titanium grades experienced the most significant increases 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  in fiscal the million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal was principally due to increases in the acm group s compensation  including incentive compensation  provision for bad debts  consulting services  and variable selling costs 
the increases in compensation million and variable selling million expenses were principally due to the significant increase in net sales and operating income during fiscal  compared with fiscal the acm group s operating income in fiscal was million  compared with operating income of million in fiscal operating results were positively impacted in fiscal compared with fiscal due to the positive impact on margins resulting from significantly higher sales volumes  partially offset by a million increase in the lifo provision  which increase was due principally to the increased cost of raw material steel being experienced within the acm group s industry as well as increases in certain other components of its manufacturing costs 
the acm group s business is heavy manufacturing in nature and consequently bears large fixed operating costs 
therefore  improvements in sales volume generally result in positive impacts on operating margins as such fixed costs are spread over more units of production  as was experienced during fiscal operating income in fiscal included million of profit on sale of excess raw material inventory  compared with million in fiscal operating income in fiscal was negatively impacted by a million increase in expenditures for the purchase of new tooling and repairs to existing tooling 
revenue associated with sales of components manufactured with new tooling generally will be realized in future periods when such component products are shipped 
turbine component services and repair group net sales from continuing operations in fiscal  which consist principally of component repair services including precision component machining and industrial coating for small aerospace turbine engines  increased to million  compared with million in fiscal during fiscal  the repair group s selling  general and administrative expenses from continuing operations increased million to million  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales  in fiscal included in both the million and million of selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal and  respectively  were million of severance and related charges

the asc group s operating loss was million in fiscal compared with operating income of million in fiscal due in part to the above noted items 
in addition  operating results were negatively impacted by i a shift  during the fiscal  in sales mix to fewer large volume contract service jobs resulting in a decline in operating efficiencies generally associated with such jobs  ii expenses related to the costs of relocating two of the group s facilities as well as the cost of operating inefficiencies experienced during the relocations  and iii higher precious metal raw material costs  which could not be immediately passed on to customers

table of contents in fiscal and  the income tax benefit related to the company s us operating losses was offset by a valuation allowance based upon an assessment of the company s ability to realize such benefits 
in assessing the company s ability to realize its deferred tax assets  management considered the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies 
future reversal of the valuation allowance will be achieved either when the tax benefit is realized or when it has been determined that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be realized through future taxable income 
a deferred tax asset of million was recognized in fiscal and was attributable to the gain on the completion of the disposal of a building and land in fiscal that was part of the repair group s irish operations  and that was recognized for irish income tax purposes in fiscal but was recognized for financial reporting purposes in fiscal in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company also recorded a us income tax provision in fiscal under the american jobs creation act of for a dividend it received from its non us subsidiaries 
b 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents increased to million at september  from million at september  at present  essentially all of the company s cash and cash equivalents are in the possession of its non us subsidiaries 
distributions from the company s non us subsidiaries to the company may be subject to statutory restriction  adverse tax consequences or other limitations 
the company s operating activities consumed million of cash of which million was from continuing operations in fiscal  compared with million of cash consumed by operating activities of which million was used by continuing operations in fiscal the million of cash used for operating activities from continuing operations in fiscal was primarily due to i million of income from continuing operations before depreciation expense and a deferred tax benefit  offset by ii a million increase in accounts receivable and a million increase in inventory  principally attributable to the acm group s response to the increased demand in its business 
the other changes in these components of working capital were due to factors resulting from normal business conditions of the company  including i sales levels  ii collections from customers  and iii the relative timing of payments to suppliers 
capital expenditures were million of which million was from continuing operations in fiscal compared to million of which million was from continuing operations in fiscal fiscal capital expenditures from continuing operations consist of million by the acm group  million by the asc group and million by the repair group 
the company anticipates that capital expenditures will be within the range of to million in fiscal to support the projected growth in the company s businesses 
in fiscal  the repair group completed the sale of its industrial repair business and certain related assets 
this sale generated net cash proceeds of approximately million during fiscal at september   the company has a million revolving credit agreement with a bank  subject to sufficiency of collateral  which expires on october  and bears interest at the bank s base rate plus 
the interest rate was at september  a commitment fee is incurred on the unused balance of the revolving credit agreement 
at september   million was outstanding and the company had million available under its million revolving credit agreement 
the company s revolving credit agreement is secured by substantially all of the company s assets located in the united states of america and a guarantee by its us subsidiaries 
under its revolving credit agreement with the bank  the company is subject to certain customary covenants 
these include  without limitation  covenants as defined that require maintenance of certain specified financial ratios  including a minimum tangible net worth level and a minimum ebitda level 
the company was in compliance with all applicable covenants at september  the company believes that cash flows from its operations together with existing cash reserves and the funds available under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements through the end of fiscal year

included in other long term liabilities in the company s balance sheet as of september  is million of liabilities related to the company s defined benefit pension plans and approximately million of net deferred tax liabilities 
the company is expected to fund million of pension obligations in fiscal e 
outlook the company s repair and acm groups businesses continue to be heavily dependent upon the strength of the commercial airlines as well as aircraft and related engine manufacturers 
consequently  the performance of the domestic and international air transport industry directly and significantly impacts the performance of the repair and acm groups businesses 
the financial condition of many airlines in the us and throughout the world  while showing improvement  continues to be weak 
the us airline industry has received us government assistance  while some airlines have entered and or proceeded through the bankruptcy reorganization process  and others continue to pursue major restructuring initiatives  which appear to have had a positive impact on operating results in recent periods 
modest improvements in the commercial airlines and increased demand in the aircraft and related engine industries have been complemented by increases in us military spending for aircraft and related components 
the air transport industry s long term outlook has been one of continued  steady growth 
such outlook suggests the need for additional aircraft and  therefore  growth in the requirement for airframe and engine components as well as aerospace turbine engine repairs 
the air transport industry is currently benefiting from several favorable trends including i projected growth in air traffic  ii the beginning of major replacement and refurbishment cycles driven by the desire for more fuel efficient aircraft and fleet commonality  and iii the increased use of wide body aircraft 
management s current outlook for the air transport industry continues to remain favorable  with expected growth through at least it is difficult to determine the potential long term impact that the aforementioned factors may have on air travel and the demand for the products and services provided by the company 
lack of continued improvement could result in credit risk associated with serving the financially troubled airlines and or their suppliers 
all of these consequences  to the extent that they may occur  could negatively impact the company s net sales  operating profits and cash flows 
however  in light of the current business environment  the company believes that cash on hand  funds available under its revolving credit agreement  and anticipated funds generated from operations will be adequate to meet its liquidity needs through the foreseeable future

critical accounting policies and estimates allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain customers to make required payments 
the company evaluates the adequacy of its allowances for doubtful accounts each quarter based on the customers credit worthiness  current economic trends or market conditions  past collection history  aging of outstanding accounts receivable and specific identified risks 
as these factors change  the company s allowances for doubtful accounts may change in subsequent periods 
historically  losses have been within management s expectations and have not been significant 
inventories the company maintains allowances for obsolete and excess inventory 
the company evaluates its allowances for obsolete and excess inventory each quarter 
each business segment maintains formal policies  which require at a minimum that reserves be established based on an analysis of the age of the inventory on a product by product basis 
in addition  if the company learns of specific obsolescence  other than that identified by the aging criteria  an additional reserve will be recognized as well 
specific obsolescence may arise due to a technological or market change  or based on cancellation of an order 
management s judgment is necessary in determining the realizable value of these products to arrive at the proper allowance for obsolete and excess inventory 
impairment of long lived assets the company reviews the carrying value of its long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  at least annually or when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
this review is performed using estimates of future undiscounted cash flows  which include proceeds from disposal of assets 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is greater than the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  and if such excess carrying value is determined to be permanent  then the long lived asset is considered impaired and an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
the company has a significant amount of property  plant and equipment 
the determination as to whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable involves judgment 
the company believes that its estimate of future undiscounted cash flows is a critical accounting estimate because i it requires the company to make assumptions about future results and ii the recognition of an impairment charge could have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
in projecting future undiscounted cash flows  the company relies on internal budgets and forecasts  and projected proceeds upon disposal of long lived assets 
the company s budgets and forecasts are based on historical results and anticipated future market conditions  such as the general business climate and the effectiveness of competition 
the company believes that its estimates of future undiscounted cash flows and fair value are reasonable  however  changes in estimates of such undiscounted cash flows and fair value could change the company s estimates of fair value 
further  actual results can differ significantly from assumptions used by the company in making its estimates 
future changes in the company s estimates could result in future impairment charges 
valuation of deferred tax allowance the company accounts for deferred taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  whereby the company recognizes an income tax benefit related to its consolidated net losses and other temporary differences between financial reporting basis and tax reporting basis 
at september   the company s net deferred tax liability before any valuation allowance was million 
at september   the income tax benefit related to its consolidated net losses and other temporary differences between financial reporting basis and tax reporting basis was offset by a valuation allowance of million based on an assessment of the company s ability to realize such benefits 
in assessing the company s ability to realize its deferred tax assets  management considered the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies 
during fiscal  the company reversed a substantial majority of the valuation allowance based on the company s determination that  at this time  it is more likely than not that the benefit will be realized through future taxable income

 fair value measurement 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
however  for some entities  the application of this statement will change current practice 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of its operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  the company is subject to foreign currency and interest rate risk 
the risks primarily relate to the sale of the company s products in transactions denominated in non us dollar currencies the euro  pound sterling and the swedish krona  the payment in local currency of wages and other costs related to the company s non us operations  and changes in interest rates on the company s long term debt obligations 
the company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
the company believes that inflation has not materially affected its results of operations in  and does not expect inflation to be a significant factor in fiscal a 
foreign currency risk the us dollar is the functional currency for all of the company s us operations 
for these operations  all gains and losses from completed currency transactions are included in income currently 
for the company s non us subsidiaries  the functional currency is the local currency 
assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at the rate of exchange at the end of the period and revenues and expenses are translated using average rates of exchange 
foreign currency translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
historically  the company has been able to mitigate the impact of foreign currency risk by means of hedging such risk through the use of foreign currency exchange contracts  which typically expire within one year 
however  such risk is mitigated only for the periods for which the company has foreign currency exchange contracts in effect  and only to the extent of the us dollar amounts of such contracts 
at september   the company had no forward exchange contracts outstanding 
the company will continue to evaluate its foreign currency risk  if any  and the effectiveness of using similar hedges in the future to mitigate such risk 
at september   the company s assets and liabilities denominated in the pound sterling  the euro and swedish krona were as follows amounts in thousands pound sterling euro swedish krona cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable accounts payable accrued liabilities b 
interest rate risk the company s primary interest rate risk exposure results from the variable interest rate mechanisms associated with the company s long term debt consisting of a revolving credit agreement with a us bank 
if interest rates were to increase or decrease basis points from the september  rate  and assuming no change in the amount outstanding under the revolving credit agreement  annual interest expense to the company would be nominally impacted 
the company s sensitivity analyses of the effects of changes in interest rates do not consider the impact of a potential change in the level of variable rate borrowings or derivative instruments outstanding that could take place if these hypothetical conditions prevail
