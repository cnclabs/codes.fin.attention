item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion highlights significant factors influencing the consolidated financial position and results of operations of the national security group  inc referred to in this document as we  our  us  the company or nsec and its subsidiaries for the three years ended december  this discussion and analysis of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of the company should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere herein 
please refer to our note regarding forward looking statements on page of this report 
financial results for marked a significant turnaround compared to the years and results for were marred by losses incurred from hurricanes dennis  katrina and rita 
this marked the first time in the history of the company that we incurred losses from three hurricanes in the same year 
results for were also adversely impacted by hurricane ivan 
we did not incur any losses from hurricanes in  however the property and casualty subsidiaries still incurred catastrophe related losses from tornadoes and hail storms totaling million pre tax in the first six months of the year 
in addition to the storm related losses  the life subsidiary incurred additional charges related to the final settlement of a long standing class action lawsuit totaling over million pre tax 
while the storm related losses were within the range of losses to be expected in an average year  the litigation related expenses reduced net income by  or per share 
despite the adverse impact of the litigation  we were able to post earnings of  our third best year in company history and an increase of over earnings of  results of operations the following analysis of the results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  which begin on page of this form k 
primary reference is made to the consolidated statements of income on page and segment information provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
consolidated results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  the year marked the sixth consecutive year of record premium revenue for the company 
our premium revenue for increased over levels achieved in however  premium revenue in was reduced by catastrophe reinsurance reinstatement premium totaling  as a result of reinstatement provisions of our catastrophe reinsurance contract triggered by hurricane katrina 
we did not incur any hurricane losses in and therefore incurred no reduction in earned premium due to charges for catastrophe reinstatement premium 
without the impact of the reduction in premium revenue for catastrophe reinstatement premium  year over year premium revenue increased by 
while the rate of growth is significantly below our annualized growth rate experienced since  the reduction of our growth rate has been necessitated by market conditions and a more moderate growth rate is to be expected over the next two years as we work to build capital and recover from the adverse operating conditions caused by the unprecedented hurricane activity experienced in and life segment revenue accounted for of consolidated premium revenue while property and casualty segment revenue accounted for of consolidated premium  virtually unchanged from the same period last year 
consolidated income before income taxes increased from  in to  in a significant improvement in our property casualty segment operations due to the lack of hurricane activity was the primary factor contributing to the improved consolidated results 
life segment operations incurred a net loss before taxes in of  comparable to the loss incurred in of 
upward revisions in a litigation settlement adversely impacted life operations for both years 
however  the longstanding litigation was settled in and no further material impact is expected going forward 
non insurance operations consists of the operations of the national security group and a owned subsidiary  the mobile attic  consolidated under the provisions of fin r 
consolidated net income for was  compared to  in on a per share basis  net income was in compared to in hurricane losses reduced our net income by  or per share 
despite the lack of hurricane activity in  we still incurred losses from catastrophic events in the form of tornado and hail losses that totaled  net of tax and reduced net income by per share 
these tornado and hail losses were incurred during the january through april time period of partially offsetting hurricane losses  we realized investment gains of  resulting from the sale of investment securities 
realized investment gains in totaled  down compared to our decisions to sell securities and therefore realize investment gains on our investments is dictated by considerations of market conditions and tax implications  among other factors  and are subject to significant fluctuation from period to period 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  total premium revenue for was  an increase of just over over premium revenue of  premium revenue in included reductions for catastrophe reinsurance reinstatement premium triggered by hurricane katrina of  and premium revenue in included reductions for catastrophe reinsurance reinstatement premium triggered by hurricane ivan of  without the impact of the reinstatement premium charges in both years  premium revenue increased 
life segment revenue accounted for of consolidated premium revenue while property and casualty segment revenue accounted for of consolidated premium 
consolidated income before income taxes declined in to  compared to  in third quarter hurricanes dennis  katrina and rita were the primary factors contributing to the decline in income before taxes in compared to the same period last year 
gross incurred losses in  before reinsurance recoveries  from the third quarter hurricanes totaled  after reinsurance recoveries  pre tax losses and expenses from third quarter hurricanes totaled over  and a catastrophe reinsurance reinstatement premium of  was also incurred in the third and fourth quarters of third quarter losses from hurricanes dennis  katrina and rita were the primary reason for the decline in net income 
losses and related expenses from hurricanes reduced net income by  or per share 
consolidated net income for was  compared to  in  a decline of 
on a per share basis earnings were in compared to in additional details on the sources of premium revenue growth and the impact of individual segments on consolidated income will be discussed in the respective segment results of operations sections that follow 
industry segment data certain financial information for the national security group s three segments life segment  property and casualty segment  and other non insurance is summarized as follows amounts in thousands premium revenues life  accident and health insurance property and casualty insurance income before taxes and minority interest life  accident and health insurance property and casualty insurance other interest expense in addition to the preceding table  reference is made to note of the consolidated financial statements contained in this report for the segment information that follows 
life and accident and health insurance operations the company s life  accident and health insurance business is conducted through national security insurance company nsic  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company organized in our life segment is the smaller of our insurance segments contributing and of total insurance premium revenue for and respectively 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  premium revenue increased to  in compared to  in insurance products sold through independent agents now account for of total premium revenue  while the home service method of distribution accounts for of total premium revenue 
premium revenue through the independent agent distribution method continues to grow at a healthy pace  with revenue increasing in compared to home service premium revenue has continued its consistent rate of decline  dropping in compared to while the rate of overall premium revenue in the life segment has moderated  the quality of business has continued to improve 
the lapse rate is a measure of the percentage of business in force that is cancelled during the year due to non payment of premium or surrender for cash value by the policyholder 
in our traditional home service market  the lapse rate has often approached  however  with the shift to the independent agent method of distribution we have experienced significant improvement in our lapse rate 
the lapse rate for was a marginal improvement over our lapse rate in of 
our lapse rates will generally be higher than the insurance market as a whole because our products are primarily intended for low to middle income consumers that may face other economic pressures from time to time 
with decreases in disposable income during economic downturns  often life and supplemental health insurance products are among the first items to be trimmed from household budgets 
also  lapse rates are significantly higher in the first year after an insurance policy is sold to a consumer 
as was discussed last year  during we became more selective in the appointment of new agents and terminated agreements with agents that produced little new business or had very high lapse rates 
we believe these efforts are beginning to show results as our lapse rate continues to improve 
commission expense  including field servicing cost from the home service method of distribution  as a percent of premium revenue had a moderate decrease of in compared to independent agent commission expense and other costs of distribution declined percentage points in compared to life insurance commission rates for independent agents are typically front loaded meaning that higher commissions are paid in the early years of a policy and commission rates decline as the policy ages 
because the independent agent method of distribution is a relatively new method of distribution  overall commission rates are skewed higher because the majority of in force policies are still paying the higher commission rates of the early years 
management is continuing to focus on reducing commissions through improving the rate of retention of new and existing business 
nsic incurred a net loss before taxes of  in compared to a net loss of  in litigation expenses totaling over million and  in and respectively were the primary factors contributing to the poor results 
the litigation related expenses are primarily related to a longstanding class action lawsuit that was settled in due to the nature of this litigation  it has been difficult to predict the ultimate outcome over the last five years and consequently  we have experienced several upward revisions in our estimates 
however  the litigation is now settled and no material additional costs are expected to be incurred 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  premium revenue increased to  in compared to  in  a marginal increase of 
as we have discussed over the last few years  we have began a shift to the independent agent method of distribution of nsic s products 
in  for the first time in company history  we had more business in force that was produced by independent agents than was in force and produced by our traditional home service method of distribution 
independent agent premium revenue grew by year over year in while home service premium revenue declined by nsic has had a primary focus on the production of new business in the independent agent method of distribution over the last five years 
during the process of establishing this position  nsic has had very low thresholds for business production and persistency 
nsic has appointments with approximately independent agents that actively produced new business in during we did begin the process of implementing new performance standards that will require minimum amounts of premium production and persistency in order to retain a contract with our company 
as a result of these standards  we have become more selective in the appointment of new agents and will discontinue appointments with many current agents 
in undertaking this exercise  we will be able to offer more exceptional service to fewer agents and produce higher quality business in the process 
this process will take a couple of years to implement but will help improve profitability of nsic in the future 
commission expense  including field servicing costs from the home service method of distribution  as a percent of premium revenue increased percentage points in compared to this increase was primarily due to increased separation cost associated in reducing home service management personnel 
independent agent commission expense and other costs of distribution declined percentage points in compared to these costs are expected to continue to decline to percentage points per year for the next couple of years until the renewal book of business reaches a point of maturity that will support short term profitability 
unfortunately  the shift to the independent agent method of distribution is expensive as life insurance commission rates for independent agents are typically front loaded meaning that higher commissions are paid in the early years of a policy and commission rates decline as the policy ages 
because the independent agent method of distribution is a relatively new method of distribution  overall commission rates are skewed higher because the majority of in force policies are still paying the higher commission rates of the early years 
management is continuing to focus on reducing commissions through improving the rate of retention of new and existing business 
nsic had a net loss before income taxes in of  compared to net income of  in expenses related to ongoing litigation totaled over  and  in and  respectively 
as discussed earlier in this report  the litigation that has caused a significant strain on profitability and company resources was settled in december of and no additional material charges are expected to be incurred in periods beyond property casualty operations the company s property and casualty insurance business is conducted through national security fire casualty company nsfc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company organized in  and omega one insurance company omega  a wholly owned subsidiary of national security fire casualty company organized in property and casualty operations constitute our largest segment composing and of our total premium revenue in and  respectively 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  property and casualty premium revenues totaled  in compared to  in  an increase of 
catastrophe reinstatement premium charges totaling  reduced premium revenue by five percentage points 
we did not experience any losses that exceeded our catastrophe reinsurance retention limit of  per event in  so no catastrophe reinstatement premium charges were incurred in without the reinstatement premium charge in  premium revenue in increased over overall premium revenue growth has moderated significantly over the past two years  compared to our compound annual growth rate experienced since we expect the trend of more moderate growth to continue in as we focus on improvement in profitability of all lines of business  institute rate increases dictated by the significant increase in our catastrophe reinsurance protection and rebuild capital levels after the adverse impact of the and hurricane seasons 
while the lack of hurricane activity in the gulf of mexico and atlantic coast were the primary drivers of our improved operating performance  we still incurred significant losses in our two primary lines of business 
our dwelling and homeowners lines of business incurred million in tornado and hail storm related losses in the first half of these events increased our combined ratio for the year by four percentage points 
however  these amounts were within our expectations of losses to be incurred in a more normal year and losses from catastrophe related events were down significantly compared to and we are still working to improve the adequacy of our rates in our core lines of business 
due to the unprecedented hurricane activity in and  we have experienced a significant increase in the cost of our catastrophe reinsurance 
our catastrophe reinsurance rate in increased 
in order to minimize the impact of the rate increase  we increased our reinsurance retention by to million 
reinsurance rates are not subject to review by state insurance regulators and are more market driven allowing reinsurers to react more rapidly to changing market conditions 
consequently  we incur significant lag time between the time we incur an increase in our cost of reinsurance and the time we are able to reflect these increased costs in our rates 
our rates are subject to review and approval by state regulators and consequently we experience significant delays in our ability to adjust rates 
these delays result in lag times of at least six months and can last up to months 
also  we have experienced political climates in some states that make it difficult for us to factor in the full impact of our increased cost of claims and reinsurance 
however  we made significant progress in adjusting our rates in and experienced some moderation in our catastrophe reinsurance rate increases for  so we expect a more favorable pricing environment in the primary line of business in which we are continuing to adjust rates in order to improve profitability is our homeowners line of business 
this line of business composes of our total property and casualty premium revenue 
the line of business has not performed to our expectations with a combined ratio of in improving profitability in this line of business will be a primary focus of our rate and underwriting review efforts in our core dwelling fire line of business produced solid results in with a combined ratio of 
the dwelling fire line of business produces of total property and casualty premium revenue and is our largest contributor to underwriting profits 
we routinely evaluate our claims frequency and severity statistics in order to better understand the nature of our risks and aide in the loss reserve liability evaluation process 
claims frequency is a measure of the number of claims incurred during a measurement period regardless of amount 
claims severity is a measure of the average dollar amount of claims during a measurement period 
claims frequency decreased significantly in compared to in  we incurred  claims compared to over  claims in claims frequency in was higher due to   and claims from hurricanes katrina  rita and dennis 
non hurricane related claims in totaled  the increase in claims  not counting hurricanes  from to is primarily related to early season hail storm and tornado losses experienced in the first half of hail storms significantly increase frequency but usually carry a relatively low severity while tornado claims carry a lower frequency than hurricanes but usually carry a higher average severity than hurricanes 
while the overall frequency of claims declined significantly in compared to  the more severe spring storm season resulted in a higher frequency of tornado losses elevated the average severity of claims in the dwelling fire and homeowners line of business 
the average severity for was  per claim compared to  per claim in  again the increase is primarily attributable to the increased tornado related losses in the first half of compared to while this event had no material impact on our earnings  we did incur an additional assessment from the mississippi windstorm underwriting association mwua in totaling over  this assessment was in addition to assessments totaling over  paid in this assessment was for additional losses incurred by mwua from hurricane katrina in mwua is a form of residual market or pooling arrangement that provides coverage to those that are unable to find private insurers willing to insure them 
all licensed property and casualty insurers writing applicable coverage are required to participate in these pooling entities 
should the pooling entity incur losses in excess of its ability to pay  the industry participants in the respective states are assessed for the excess losses 
due to the extensive growth and development in the coastal regions of the gulf of mexico over the last decade  many of the pools in the states in which we operate  particularly alabama and mississippi  have experienced extensive growth 
fortunately  in the case of the mwua assessment we had adequate reinsurance protection in place and this assessment was covered by our catastrophe reinsurance 
we did incur an additional charge for pro rata reinstatement premium due to the assessment 
however  this charge was not material to our earnings 
while the mwua assessment was covered by our catastrophe coverage and had no impact on earnings  it is still noteworthy because it brings to light the magnitude of risk that companies incur from coastal pools 
first of all  this charge further depleted our remaining reinsurance protection available to cover claims we pay directly for hurricane katrina 
the assessment brought us to within less than  of depleting our final layer of reinsurance protection 
while we do not expect any additional material development associated with katrina  should we exceed our final layer of coverage  we would incur additional charges to earnings for the losses in excess of our catastrophe reinsurance protection 
also  this assessment exposes the magnitude to which many of the coastal pools maintain inadequate catastrophe reinsurance protection 
while some states in which we operate are pursuing changes in the structure of their coastal underwriting pools and seeking additional reinsurance protection  our risk in these pools remains difficult to quantify 
we continue to actively pursue options to better manage this risk  however  as discussed earlier in our risk factors section of this report  organizational structure and equitability of state underwriting pools remain a primary concern and focus for us going forward 
property and casualty income before income taxes was  for compared to  in our combined ratio for was compared to in the combined ratio for of included catastrophe related tornado and hail storm losses totaling over  and adding to our combined ratio 
without the impact of hurricanes in  our combined ratio was 
as discussed previously and as indicated by evaluation of our combined ratio  the significant decline in catastrophe losses was the primary driver of the improved results 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  property and casualty premium revenues totaled  in compared to  in  an increase of just over 
the property and casualty subsidiaries have generated significant growth in revenue over the last four years 
while growth has slowed  premium revenue was reduced due to additional ceded reinsurance premium paid under the reinstatement provisions of our catastrophe reinsurance contracts triggered by hurricane katrina 
premium revenue for was reduced by due to similar provisions triggered by hurricane ivan 
while overall premium revenue growth moderated significantly in compared to  the property and casualty subsidiaries continued to grow primary dwelling property lines of dwelling fire  homeowners and mobile homeowners with growth rates of  and respectively 
offsetting these gains were declines in non standard private passenger automobile and ocean marine lines of business 
we expect the trend of more moderate premium revenue growth to continue in with premium revenue growth expected to be in the range of 
the hurricane season was the overriding event that led to a decline in earnings for the year and of course property and casualty operations was the operating segment that bore the full brunt of the hurricane season 
income before income tax in the segment declined to  in compared to  in  a decrease of claims frequency increased significantly in compared to with claims on dwelling lines of business homeowners and dwelling fire exceeding  claims compared to  claims in approximately  claims were reported from hurricane katrina in  very close to the  claims reported from hurricane ivan in however  the average severity of claims from hurricane katrina was much higher with losses averaging over  each compared to less than  per occurrence from hurricane ivan 
the increase in the average loss per claim is due to the widespread impact of this huge storm causing severe damage in coastal areas of alabama  louisiana and the most heavily impacted coastal area  mississippi 
the most heavily impacted coastal area for us from hurricane ivan was concentrated in baldwin county  alabama 
additionally  we paid nearly million in underwriting association assessments due to losses from hurricane katrina 
in addition to katrina  we incurred over  claims from hurricane rita with an average severity of  and hurricane dennis with over claims and an average severity of  non hurricane related dwelling property claims totaled  in which remained consistent with non hurricane related claims of just over  average severity for all dwelling property claims was  per occurrence in compared to  in as discussed earlier  average severity was skewed downward due to lower average claims from hurricane ivan 
hurricanes typically cause higher number of claims frequency and a lower average cost per claim severity than tornado related losses 
tornadoes tend to affect a more isolated area and therefore have a lower frequency but typically cause more structural damage including a higher proportion of total losses  therefore  severity is greater from tornado losses 
non catastrophe related dwelling losses typically have an average per loss severity in the  to  range for the p c subsidiaries 
to help add a little perspective to the magnitude of the hurricane season  we thought it may be useful to give a few statistics 
total insured losses from hurricane katrina alone totaled more than the cumulative amount of hurricane losses paid in previous company history dating back to hurricane katrina was the most expensive hurricane in company history  exceeding the previous most costly storm  hurricane ivan  by over 
hurricane rita  which was a bit of an afterthought in the media  was the fourth most costly hurricane in company history with losses of  our property and casualty subsidiaries had previously never incurred two major hurricanes in a season until hurricanes katrina and rita in we had also never incurred consecutive hurricane seasons with a major hurricane until and with ivan  katrina and rita 
while we would like to think that the events of the last two years are statistical anomalies  we are taking a critical look at our hurricane risk mitigation program with a goal of better managing this risk should we actually be entering an era of more frequent and severe atlantic and gulf coast hurricanes 
this is especially challenging for us as a regional carrier with a large percentage of total business concentrated primarily in the southeastern united states 
because of our geographic concentration of risk  we will be unable to totally eliminate the impact of future storms  but we do believe that the events of the last two years will allow some changes in the markets we serve to help mitigate the impact of future storms on short term profits 
we are in the process of making several changes to help reduce future storm exposure 
we will be reviewing rates and minimum deductibles on over of our programs during obviously the risk reward paradigm for writing in coastal areas of the southeastern us has shifted in the last two years 
while we do not want to abandon areas that we have served successfully for many years  we find it necessary to seek higher margins on our insurance products in certain coastal areas in an effort justify the economic feasibility of continuing to write in these areas 
we are increasing marketing efforts in the non coastal states that we serve in order to gain greater geographic diversity 
of course this opens us up to more significant exposure to other types of risk such as more frequent tornados  hail storms and ice storms but these types of events are generally more geographically concentrated and help mitigate the risk of the widespread exposure posed by atlantic and gulf coast hurricanes 
another challenge posed by the events of that will have an impact on future earnings of the property and casualty subsidiaries is the cost that we pay for catastrophe reinsurance 
we incurred an increase in catastrophe reinsurance in of as a result the frequency of storm related losses over the last two years 
in addition  we were required to increase our catastrophe deductible by to  in order to limit the increase in catastrophe reinsurance rates to only 
this has necessitated that we increase rates in many of the areas we serve 
our reinsurance rate increase took effect january  unfortunately  due to regulatory hurdles and backlogs created from a large number of other insurers filing revised rates in the affected states as well  we will be unable to reflect the increased reinsurance rates we pay in rates charged to our insureds for up to a year 
this will result in a drag on earnings of approximately  pre tax 
however  we believe that the short term earnings drag will be offset by increased pricing power and less competition in many of the areas impacted by the hurricane season 
property casualty combined ratio a measure used to analyze a property casualty insurer s underwriting performance is the combined ratio 
it is the sum of two ratios a 
the loss and loss expense ratio  which measures losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred as a percentage of premium revenue 
b 
the underwriting expense ratio  which measures underwriting expenses incurred eg  agents commissions  premium taxes  and other administrative underwriting expenses as a percentage of premium revenue 
the results of these ratios for the past three years were loss and lae ratio underwriting expense ratio combined ratio maintaining a combined ratio below  which indicates that the company is making an underwriting profit  depends upon many factors including hurricane activity in the gulf of mexico and the southern atlantic coast  strict underwriting of risks  and adequate and timely premium rates 
a major hurricane hitting the coast of alabama  georgia  south carolina  mississippi  louisiana  or texas could cause the combined ratio to fluctuate materially from prior years 
the property and casualty subsidiaries maintain catastrophe reinsurance to minimize the effect of a major catastrophe 
the combined ratio for improved significantly at compared to in no hurricane activity was experienced in which led to the reduction in the combined ratio 
the combined ratio for compared to increased percentage points 
this increase was entirely due to losses incurred from hurricanes dennis  katrina and rita which each added  and percentage points to the combined ratio respectively 
hurricane ivan added percentage points to the combined ratio for non insurance operations the non insurance operations of the company consist of our parent company  national security group and a owned subsidiary consolidated under the provision of fin r 
the national security group has no material sources of revenue and relies almost entirely on dividends from the insurance operations to pay expenses 
these dividends are eliminated upon consolidation of the subsidiaries in the audited financials included herein 
the expenses of the group consist of expenses associated with the public listing of our stock  taxes and fees  and directors fees 
the most significant expense of the group is interest expense associated with  in debt 
this debt is composed of  in borrowing set to mature in management has not yet determined whether this debt will be paid in full or refinanced  but we do not expect any difficulties in refinancing should we decide to do so 
the remaining  in debt is the proceeds from a trust preferred security offering undertaken in december of the primary use for these proceeds was to add capital to the property and casualty subsidiaries to allow flexibility in continuing to increase new business production at a moderate rate 
total interest expense for the group associated with these borrowings in was  compared to  in as the trust preferred offering was not completed until december  the owned subsidiary  the mobile attic  is not considered a major segment of the company contributing of total gross revenue of the company 
mobile attic is consolidated under the provision of fin r due to the existence of debt guarantees provided by the company on  in debt of mobile attic 
the debt is backed by all of the assets of mobile attic and the guarantee of the company was facilitated in order to obtain more favorable financing for mobile attic 
as is disclosed in the notes to the financial statements  we are in discussions to dispose of the majority of our interest in mobile attic 
while terms of the arrangement have yet to be finalized  any disposal would be contingent upon the release of the company from any guarantees of mobile attic debt 
we will release further details in subsequent k filings with the sec once the consummation of an agreement becomes imminent 
asset portfolio review the life insurance and property casualty subsidiaries primarily invest in highly liquid investment grade debt and equity securities 
at december   the company s holdings in debt securities amounted to of total investments and of total assets 
the following is a breakdown of the bond portfolio quality according to national association of insurance commissioners naic securities valuation office svo rating standards  and the nationally recognized rating organization equivalents of moody s and standard and poor s svo equivalents svo class moody s standard and poor s of total bond portfolio aaa to a aaa to a baa to baa bbb to bbb ba to ba bb to bb b to b b to b caa to ca ccc to c caa to ca c to d as of january   the company adopted financial accounting standards board statement and reclassified a portion of its fixed maturity securities portfolio as available for sale  with the remainder being classified as held to maturity 
with that reclassification  the fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale are carried at fair value and changes in fair values  net of related income taxes  are charged or credited to shareholders equity see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the insurance subsidiaries fixed maturity securities include mortgage backed bonds  primarily collateralized mortgage obligations cmo s  of million and million at december  and respectively 
the mortgage backed bonds are subject to risks associated with variable prepayments of the underlying mortgage loans 
prepayments cause those securities to have different actual maturities than were expected at the time of purchase 
securities that are purchased at a premium to par value and prepay faster than expected will incur a reduction in yield or loss 
securities that are purchased at a discount to par value and prepay faster than expected will generate an increase in yield or gain 
the degree to which a security is susceptible to either gains or losses is influenced by the difference between amortized cost and par value  the relative sensitivity of the underlying mortgages backing the assets to prepayments in a changing interest rate environment and the repayment priority of the securities in the overall securitization structure 
in order to minimize risk associated with prepayments on collateralized mortgage obligations  the company typically invests primarily in more predictable planned amortization class pac structures of cmo s and typically avoids investment in cmo s priced at significant premiums above par value 
the results with respect to the foregoing investments are as follows year ended december net investment income average current yield on investments total return on investments net realized gains on investments before taxes changes in net unrealized gains on investments before income taxes as of december   the maturity schedule for all bonds and notes held by the company  stated at amortized cost  was as follows maturity schedule amounts in thousands maturity available for sale held to maturity total percentage of total maturity in less than year maturity in years maturity in years maturity after years it should be noted that the above table is maturities based on stated maturity 
due to call and prepayment features inherent in some debt securities  actual repayment will differ from stated maturities 
the company routinely evaluates the impact of changing interest rates on the projected maturities of bonds in the portfolio and actively manages the portfolio in order to minimize the impact of interest rate risk 
liquidity and capital resources due to regulatory restrictions  the majority of the company s cash is required to be invested in investment grade securities to provide ample protection for policyholders 
the liabilities of the property and casualty insurance subsidiaries are of various terms and  therefore  those subsidiaries invest in securities with various maturities spread over periods usually not exceeding years 
the liabilities of the life insurance subsidiary are typically of a longer duration  and therefore  a higher percentage of securities in the life insurance subsidiary are invested for periods exceeding years 
the liquidity requirements for the company are primarily met by funds generated from operations of the life insurance and property casualty insurance subsidiaries 
premium and investment income as well as maturities and sales of invested assets provide the primary sources of cash for both the life and property casualty businesses  while applications of cash are applied by both businesses to the payment of policy benefits  the cost of acquiring new business principally commissions  operating expenses  purchases of new investment  and in the case of life insurance  policy loans 
the national security group s consolidated statement of cash flows indicates that operating activities provided used cash of   and  in   and  respectively 
the significant increase in cash flow from operating activities in was primarily due to the improvement in underwriting results in the property and casualty subsidiaries 
the negative cash flow from operations in was due to the significant increase in hurricane losses 
cash flow from operations in was also adversely impacted by the significant increase in hurricane claims associated with hurricane ivan 
the consolidated statement of cash flows also reflects a decrease increase in cash from financing activities of   and  respectively 
the decrease in cash flow from financing activities in reflects the reduction of debt held by mobile attic of  and the payment of shareholder dividends of  cash flow from financing activities in reflects proceeds from a trust preferred securities offering of  repayment of mobile attic debt of  and payment of shareholder dividends of  cash flow from financing activities in consists primarily of shareholder dividends of  contractual obligations and commitments payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years debt obligations property and casualty claim reserves short term debt obligations consist of  held directly by the company and  in debt held by mobile attic 
the company will most likely seek to refinance the  in debt at maturity 
we do not foresee any issues arising that would prevent us from refinancing at rates comparable to what we are now paying 
should the negotiations to sell mobile attic materialize  the terms of the sale would include the assumption of mobile attic debt by the purchaser and the release of our guarantees of the debt 
otherwise  we expect that mobile attic will refinance its debt and we will remain guarantor of the debt until such time that mobile attic can obtain more favorable financing on its own 
included in long term debt held directly by the company is the issuance of  in subordinated debentures completed on december  the proceeds from the debentures were used to make a  capital infusion in the p c subsidiary national security fire and casualty with the remainder to be held for general corporate purposes 
the subordinated debentures mature december  it is anticipated that principal payments will not be made until the expiration of the fixed rate period on the debt in for further discussion of the subordinated debentures please review note to the consolidated financial statements and form k filed december   which is incorporated herein by reference 
in estimating the time interval for payment of property and casualty claim reserves  the company utilized historical payment patterns 
by the nature of the insurance contracts under which these liabilities exist  there can be no certainty that actual payments will fall in the periods indicated above 
however  management feels that current liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to pay these obligations as they come due 
also  due to the relatively short tail nature of the majority of the company s claim liabilities  management can conclude with a reasonable level of confidence that historical patterns indicate that approximately of claim liabilities at the end of a given year are settled within the following two year period 
the ability of the company to meet its commitments for timely payment of claims and other expenses depends  in addition to current cash flow  on the liquidity of its investments 
on december   the company had no known impairments of assets or changes in operation  which would have a material adverse effect upon liquidity 
approximately of the company s insurance subsidiary assets are invested in cash  investment grade fixed income securities  short term investments and broadly traded equity securities  which are highly liquid 
the values of these investments are subject to the conditions of the markets in which they are traded 
past fluctuations in these markets have had little effect on the liquidity of the company 
the company has relatively little exposure to lower grade fixed income investments which might be especially subject to liquidity problems due to thinly traded markets 
except as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company is aware of no known trends  events  or uncertainties reasonably likely to have a material effect on its liquidity  capital resources  or operations 
additionally  the company has not been made aware of any recommendations of regulatory authorities  which if implemented  would have such an effect 
as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  in  the amount that the national security group s insurance subsidiaries can transfer in the form of dividends to the parent company is limited to  in the life insurance subsidiary and  in the property casualty insurance subsidiary 
however  that condition poses no current short term or long term liquidity concerns for the parent company 
off balance sheet arrangements with the consolidation of owned subsidiary the mobile attic  inc  triggered by preexisting debt guarantees and the adoption of financial accounting standards board interpretation fin r  the company has no off balance sheet arrangements 
statutory risk based capital of insurance subsidiaries the naic has adopted risk based capital rbc requirements for life health and property casualty insurance companies to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks such as asset quality  mortality and morbidity  asset and liability matching  benefit and loss reserve adequacy  and other business factors 
state insurance regulators will use the rbc formula as an early warning tool to identify  for the purpose of initiating regulatory action  insurance companies that potentially are inadequately capitalized 
in addition  the formula defines minimum capital standards that will supplement the current system of low fixed minimum capital and surplus requirements on a state by state basis 
regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of the company s regulatory total adjusted capital  as defined by the naic  to its authorized control level rbc  as defined by the naic 
companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within levels  each of which requires corrective action 
the levels and ratios are as follows ratio of total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc regulatory event less than or equal to company action level regulatory action level authorized control level mandatory control level the ratios of total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc for the national security group s life health and property casualty insurance subsidiaries are all in excess of to at december  national security insurance company life insurer has regulatory adjusted capital of and million at december  and  respectively  and a ratio of regulatory total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc of and at december  and respectively

application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are based upon the development and application of accounting policies that require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
accounting policies may be based on including but not limited to gaap authoritative literature  statutory authoritative literature  regulations and industry standards 
the company s financial results would be directly impacted by changes in assumptions and judgments used to select and apply our accounting policies 
it is management s opinion that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in regards to the application of our accounting policies and their affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
reinsurance receivables deferred policy acquisition costs deferred taxes valuation of investments reserves for losses and loss adjustment expense recognition of revenue evaluation of litigation reinsurance as part of our risk management strategy we routinely cede risks associated with insurance policies we underwrite to reinsurers pursuant to contractual agreements 
reinsurance provides protection for individual loss occurrences  including catastrophes  to alleviate fluctuation in the results of our underwriting activities and to limit our net liability for individual risks 
the estimated reinsurance recoverable on paid losses  including an estimate for losses incurred but not reported  and amounts paid to reinsurers applicable to unexpired terms of policies in force are reported as assets 
a reinsurance arrangement does not discharge the issuing company from primary liability to the insured  and the issuing company is required to discharge its liability to the insured even if the reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations under the reinsurance arrangements 
reinsurance  however  does make the reinsurer liable to the issuing company to the extent of any reinsurance in force at the time of the loss 
reinsurance arrangements also decrease premiums retained by the issuing company since that company pays the reinsuring company a portion of total premiums based upon the amount of liability reinsured 
when a claim is made under a policy we have reinsured  we initially pay the full amount owed to the policyholder or claimant 
subsequently  we initiate the process to recover any amounts due from reinsurers in accordance with the terms of applicable reinsurance treaties 
the estimated recoverable is recorded as an asset on the financial statements 
at december   the estimated reinsurance recoverable recorded was  the company does not anticipate any issues with collection of the recorded amount 
the reinsurance related amounts recorded have been estimated based upon management s interpretation of the related reinsurance treaty 
areas in which judgment has been used regarding said estimates include assessing the financial viability and credit quality of each reinsurer as well as the ability of each reinsurer to pay amounts owed 
there is a possibility that the actual amounts recovered from reinsurers could be materially less than the estimates recorded 
this possibility could result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
reinsurers may dispute claims under reinsurance treaties  such as the calculated amount of reinsurance recoverable 
management does not anticipate any issues with recoverability of reinsurance balances based on current evaluations of collectibility 
nsic generally reinsures all risks in excess of  with respect to any one insured 
nsfc and omega generally reinsure with third parties any liability in excess of  on any single policy 
in addition  the property and casualty subsidiaries have catastrophe excess reinsurance  which protects it in part with respect to aggregate property losses arising out of a single catastrophe  such as a hurricane 
in  the property and casualty subsidiaries had catastrophe protection up to a million loss with a retention deductible of million 
based on an evaluation using actual nsfc and omega exposures and catastrophe modeling based on a year loss  that is a loss that has a less than of probability of occurring in any given year  the property and casualty subsidiaries would pay pre tax approximately million in losses and reinstatement and reinsurers would pay pre tax million 
for  the property and casualty subsidiaries maintained catastrophe reinsurance protection in the amount of million 
however  due to continued increases in rates  we increased our deductible from  to  the increase in the catastrophe reinsurance rate for was 
in addition to the increase in rates  we are currently seeking to add an additional layer or reinsurance protection  increasing our total reinsurance coverage up to million 
this has become necessary to maintain protection based on changes in computer models given the increase in hurricane frequency and severity in and this will provide protection up to at least a year near term event as depicted in catastrophe modeling results 
the near term catastrophe modeling results reflect a predicted increase in storm activity given the current weather pattern and various factors projected to impact our weather patterns in the near term 
we believe that maintaining protection to at least a year near term event will be comparable with our past practice of maintaining catastrophe reinsurance protection up to a year event under the previous models 
for more information regarding reinsurance please see note to our consolidated financial statements 
deferred policy acquisition costs deferred policy acquisition costs dac are those costs incurred in connection with acquiring new business or renewing existing business 
dac is primarily comprised of commissions and other costs related to issuing insurance policies  net of amounts ceded to reinsurers 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  these costs are not expensed in their entirety  rather they are recorded as an asset and amortized over the lives of the policies 
a reduction in dac is recognized if the sum of the expected loss and loss adjustment expenses  unamortized acquisition costs  and maintenance costs exceeds related unearned premiums and projected investment income 
management reviews dac calculations throughout the year to establish and assess their recoverability 
changes in management s assumptions  estimates or judgment with respect to calculating dac could materially impact our financial statements and financial condition 
changes in loss ratios  projected investment income  premium rates or overall expense levels could negatively impact the recoverability of dac 
at december   we had recorded  as an asset for dac in our financial statements 
we do not foresee any issues related to recoverability of these capitalized costs 
for more information regarding deferred policy acquisition costs  please see note to our financial statements 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes are created when there are differences between assets and liabilities for tax and financial reporting purposes  as well as tax credits  net operating losses and other carry forwards 
sfas accounting for income taxes  requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the available evidence  it is more likely than not that all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
this standard requires management to exercise judgment in determining whether or not the deferred tax asset is realizable 
at december   there is no evidence to suggest to management that any deferred tax asset is unrealizable 
for more information regarding deferred income taxes  please see note to our financial statements 
valuation of investments investments are recorded at fair value based upon quoted prices when available 
quoted prices are available for every investment debt and equity security included in the financial statements 
periodically  the carrying values of an individual investment may become temporarily impaired because of time value  volatility  credit quality and existing market conditions 
management evaluates investments to determine whether the impairment is other than temporary 
evaluation criteria include credit quality of security  severity of decrease between cost and market value  length of time of the impairment and likelihood that the impairment will reverse in the near future 
at december   there were no other than temporary impairments 
for more information regarding valuation of investments  see note to our financial statements 
loss and loss adjustment expense property and casualty loss reserves are maintained to cover the estimated unpaid liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to reported and unreported incurred claims 
loss reserves are an estimation based on actuarial projection techniques common in the insurance industry 
reserves are management s expectations of what the settlement and administration of claims will cost 
management estimated reserves are based on historical settlement patterns  estimated salvage and subrogation  and an appraisal of the related facts and circumstances 
management s reserve estimates are reviewed by independent actuaries to determine their adequacy and reasonableness 
at december   the recorded liability for loss and loss and adjustment expense was  we believe this estimate of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense to be sufficient based on currently available information and a review of our historical reserving practices 
for more information regarding loss and loss adjustment expense  see note to our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary objectives in managing its investment portfolio are to maximize investment income and total investment returns while minimizing overall credit risk 
investment strategies are developed based on many factors including changes in interest rates  overall market conditions  underwriting results  regulatory requirements and tax position 
investment decisions are made by management and reviewed by the board of directors 
market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in fair value of securities 
the three potential risks related to the company s fixed maturity portfolio are interest rate risk  prepayment risk and default risk 
the primary risk related to the company s equity portfolio is equity price risk 
since the company s assets and liabilities are largely monetary in nature  the company s financial position and earnings are subject to risks resulting from changes in interest rates at varying maturities  changes in spreads over us treasuries on new investment opportunities  changes in the yield curve and equity pricing risks 
the company is exposed to equity price risk on its equity securities 
the company holds common stock with a fair value of million 
based on an evaluation of the historical risk measure of our portfolio relative to the s p  if the market value of the s p index decreased from its december  value  the fair value of the company s common stock would decrease by approximately million 
certain fixed interest rate market risk sensitive instruments may not give rise to incremental income or loss during the period illustrated but may be subject to changes in fair values 
note in the consolidated financial statements presents additional disclosures concerning fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities  and is incorporated by reference herein 
the company limits the extent of its market risk by purchasing securities that are backed by stable collateral  the majority of the assets are issued by us government sponsored entities 
also  the majority of all of the subsidiaries cmo s are planned amortization class pac bonds 
pac bonds are typically the lowest risk cmo s  and provide greater cash flow predictability 
such securities with reduced risk typically have a lower yield  but higher liquidity  than higher risk mortgage backed bonds 
to reduce the risk of loss of principal should prepayments exceed expectations  the company does not purchase mortgage backed securities at significant premiums over par value 
the company s investment approach in the equity markets is based primarily on a fundamental analysis of value 
this approach requires the investment committee to invest in well managed  primarily dividend paying companies  which have a low debt to capital ratio  above average return on capital for a sustained period of time  and low volatility rating beta relative to the market 
the dividends provide a steady cash flow to help pay current claim liabilities  and it has been the company s experience that by following this investment strategy  long term investment results have been superior to those offered by bonds  while keeping the risk of loss of capital to a minimum relative to the overall equity market 
as for shifts in investment allocations  the major shift has been a move away from corporate bonds and into government agency issues 
corporate spreads have remained extremely tight relative to agency securities 
due to the tight interest rate spreads  the investment committee has not felt compelled from a risk reward standpoint to increase or maintain the allocation to corporate bonds 
corporate bonds compose just of bond investments compared to over last year 
in contrast  government securities  primarily agency issues  compose of bond investments compared to last year 
collateralized mortgage obligations  which primarily consist of planned amortization class structures  now compose of bond investment compared to last year 
the company does not anticipate any further major shifts in fixed income investment allocations in the near future
