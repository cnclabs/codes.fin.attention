item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general meridian is an independent oil and natural gas company that explores for  acquires and develops oil and natural gas properties utilizing d seismic technology 
our operations have historically been focused on the onshore oil and natural gas regions in south louisiana  the texas gulf coast and offshore in the gulf of mexico 
during  the company began to diversify its oil and natural gas exploration and development portfolio to include longer lived reserve properties with the addition of its east and west texas  north central oklahoma and kentucky exploration and development opportunities 
declines in the existence of conventional exploration projects in very mature producing basins  such as south louisiana and the shallow shelf areas of the gulf of mexico  have impacted the number of economic prospects available for drilling 
this is partly the result of better technology that has improved the industry s ability to determine probabilities of success  and partly the result of new projects being smaller in size compared to the decline rates exhibited by the giant fields discovered  generally  prior to the s 
as a result  the company made a shift during and extended what had been a highly successful exploration program during the early s  from drilling purely deep  higher risk  yet higher potential prospects  to place more emphasis on the development of an exploration inventory of shallower  lower risk  repeatable  multi well plays 
this shift was the genesis of two very successful exploration plays thornwell and biloxi marshlands where multiple wells were drilled either just above pressures  or the first sands into geo pressures 
in both instances  the company developed processing and interpretation techniques that identified direct hydrocarbon indicators and developed reserves with probabilities of success levels greater than each 
meridian s management believes that the basin itself still contains both tremendous attributes high producing rates  high cash flows and returns  plus lower lifting costs once proved and remaining opportunities for a company  such as meridian  that possesses a unique position in the region a position marked by technical knowledge and expertise  relationships  acreage positions  seismic inventory and data and prospect inventory 
however  the fact remains that the replacement of reserves year after year in this region continues to be more and more difficult under current conditions 
with the recent increase in commodity prices  the industry is now experiencing a new paradigm in domestic exploration 
recent price increases and enhanced technology has enabled the industry  as a whole  to consider domestic exploration projects that were once uneconomic 
these are predominantly classed as unconventional tight gas and resource shale or resource material plays 
the barnett shale field in northern texas is the best  but not the only  example of this type of play 
it is estimated that as much as of current domestic production now stems from accumulation of this nature 
these fields are quite prolific  extend over large areas  but are also very cost sensitive  with breakeven costs often at per mcf or more on large capital investments 
in recognition of the totality of circumstances  including the availability of these styles of play opportunities and the company s high current cash position stemming from its higher producing rate gulf coast properties  in early  meridian s management introduced as a part of its business plan  the further expansion of its exploration program to include the identification and development of unconventional and resource plays into its portfolio 
since that decision  the company has entered into joint ventures and acquired strategic acreage positions in basins recognized for both the unconventional and resource exploration plays 
the company has expanded its technical and business development staff to include a team of experienced professionals and consultants who will be primarily responsible for the further extension of the company s reserve base and reserve life in the unconventional resource plays 
operations overview our four primary regions where the capital budget will be spent  and where we are currently active are the gulf coast region of south louisiana  south texas  on and offshore  east texas  and the mid continent region of north central oklahoma 
subsequent to the company s operational update during december  the company has participated in wells results detailed below and currently has six wells logged with apparent pay  awaiting completion  testing and pipeline construction 
south louisiana 
south louisiana remains a core area for meridian where the company has built a large knowledge and information base that it believes holds value from the development of future projects that typically enjoy faster returns of capital and higher potential returns on investment 
for calendar year  the company has scheduled participation in a minimum of six to eight exploration wells and three development wells in the south louisiana region comprising approximately of its exploration and development budget 
to date  the company has drilled two wells in the south louisiana region  the turning basin odom no 
well wi and the phoenix lake e

well and was drilled as a sidetrack from the odom no 
wellbore  saving rig mobilization  drilling and equipment costs for the drilling of the second well 
the e 
w 
brown no 
well has been completed and is being prepared for an initial production test 
historic production from wells completed in the same formation in the area and initial interpretations of the electric logs and core samples from the well indicate the potential for natural gas rich with condensate 
pending the results of the initial tests  the company has initiated permitting for the construction of the pipeline and production facilities for the well 
it is anticipated that the well will be placed into production during late second or early third quarter of this year 
the company owns approximately working interest in the well and is the operator 
in addition  meridian will test its nitrogen injection program in the company s weeks island field located near new iberia  louisiana 
the field was part of the original asset package acquired from shell oil company during august and has been a prolific producer of oil and natural gas for meridian since its purchase 
the process is intended to recover attic oil reserves adjacent to the dome that are updip to perforations in the well bores which would otherwise require additional wells to recover the same reserves 
if successful  the nitrogen injection will develop the additional reserves at significantly less cost and less risk than drilling new wells adjacent to the salt dome 
this program is expected to begin during late second quarter or third quarter the company owns approximately working interest and is the operator 
deep archtop 
upon completing the development potential of all sands in the deep archtop prospect  the company began its marketing effort in mid january once completed  it began to prepare the project engineering design for drilling and estimated costs 
the project is designed to test a jurassic cotton valley four way closure in the biloxi marshlands area of st 
bernard parish louisiana 
this  foot prospect has over  acres of closure  imaged by d seismic and offers reserve potential of up to trillion cubic feet of gas 
the company will spend the coming year in pre drill work  followed by plus days to drill the well 
the projected spud date for the well is early second quarter and will cost an estimated million to drill 
the shallow marshlands water location provides the potential for significant savings in drilling the test well and post development infrastructure 
similarly sized offshore projects typically cost much more and require longer periods of time to construct the necessary pipelines and production facilities 
meridian owns production facilities and pipelines in the immediate area 
meridian intends to retain and pay it share of approximately working interest to the casing point in this well 
south texas 
as a part of the asset purchase from oxy vintage during  the company acquired approximately  gross acres in the nueces bay area immediately north of corpus christi  texas 
since that time the company has participated in three successful outside operated wells  the countiss mccracken gu no 
well  currently being re completed and awaiting stimulation  the bp america well which was placed on production as reported during december  and the st no 
well 
the st no 
well was drilled to a depth of approximately  feet measured depth md to test the deep frio sands 
the results of the electric logs on the st no 
well showed apparent gas pay in five frio sand intervals for a total of approximately feet of net pay in the formation  which will require fracture stimulation 
the company owns approximately working interest in these three wells 
meridian s first operated venture in the area since closing the acquisition was its indian point st no 
well which was drilled to a depth of approximately  feet md  feet tvd to test the deep frio sands 
the results of the electric logs reflected apparent gas pay in six frio sand intervals for a total of approximately feet of net pay in the formation  which will require fracture stimulation 
accordingly  the company has elected to move straight to preparing the well for fracture stimulation in the deep anderson frio sand package 
should the fracture stimulation prove to be successful  the company has one additional well scheduled for and an additional three to four prospective locations offset to the well 
the company owns approximately working interest in this well and is the operator 
for  the company plans to spend approximately of its exploration and development budget in this area 
offshore louisiana texas 
as an extension of meridian s onshore exploration efforts in the south louisiana and southeast texas gulf coast region  the company will drill three projects in the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico 
the initial wells scheduled to be drilled during comprise approximately of the company s exploration and development budget 
depending on the success of initial wells in each area  the company has sufficient acreage for development 
the first well is scheduled to be spud during the second quarter and is located on leases acquired at the lease sale during  specifically the west cameron block the well is designed to be drilled to a depth of approximately  feet md to test sands in the plio pleistocene 
meridian owns working interest before casing point and working interest after casing point and will be the operator 
the two additional prospects are being readied for drilling during the third and fourth quarters of east texas area 
the east texas area has become one of meridian s major impact plays added to its portfolio during and was the first step out by the company in its development of extension plays beyond its south louisiana focus area 
the company has scheduled approximately seven wells for this field during which comprise approximately of its exploration and development budget for the year 
the company is devoting a significant effort to the development of this play for its near and long term potential as well as its daily producing rates and reserves 
the play was originally designed to test d seismic based prospects similar to the woodbine production in the aa wells field 
after drilling the initial four wells during the first and second quarters of  it appeared that each contained the same or similar austin chalk section that was present in the nearby producing field miles to the east 
further evaluation of the austin chalk was initiated with the drilling of two laterals in the bsm no 
well once rig equipment was available starting in may and resulted in the successful test of the austin chalk section on the company s then approximate  acre lease position 
the well was placed on production during october at approximately mmcfe d 
the well is currently producing at a level rate of approximately mmcfe d 
estimates of reserves are consistent with what the company believes are the better wells in the area 
during december  meridian initiated the drilling of dual laterals on the second of the first four vertical wells  the katherine leary no 
well  and has drilled the first or northern lateral approximately  feet from the vertical wellbore  set the slotted liner and is currently drilling the second or southern lateral 
based on flares from what is believed to be the first lateral  the leary no 
well appears to have potential gas and oil condensate production similar to the bsm no 
once the second lateral is completed  both laterals will be tested into sales 
as part of the further development of the field  the company began an aggressive leasing program in the area to improve its acreage position 
meridian and its partners currently have under lease or control approximately  acres and continue to aggressively pursue leasing additional acreage positions in the area 
current estimates and acreage projections suggest that the development of the area will initially require approximately to additional wells 
meridian is the operator of the field and anticipates that it will own working interest ranging between and in the units in the area  depending on partner participation and lease interests within each unit 
rig purchase and east texas development 
in an effort to ensure that the company s development schedule is maintained  the company recently signed an agreement for the construction and purchase of one newly built land based drilling rig in conjunction with an engineering design and fabrication rig contractor  orion drilling company lp 
this contractor will ultimately operate  crew and maintain the rig 
delivery of the rig is currently expected in the third quarter of when the rig will be mobilized to the company s east texas austin chalk play 
depending on the success of the operations in the play  the company has plans for a two rig  multi well drilling program to exploit the company s acreage under lease for an anticipated three to five year period 
the first additional rig is scheduled to arrive in the area within approximately two or three weeks 
a second additional rig will be added during april or may after the completion of the leary no 
well and that rig is released 
oklahoma hunton mississippian play 
the oklahoma hunton mississippian play is another in the company s list of primary focus areas for growth 
the company has scheduled up to wells in this play during which is located in garfield county  oklahoma  and has dedicated approximately of its exploration and development budget for to this play 
to date  the company has completed the drilling of its first salt water disposal well and the first two gas wells in the hunton section 
currently the company is drilling its first mississippian well in the play  which will be a horizontal well and is currently at approximately  feet md 
the enterprise no 
and the constellation wells are awaiting completion of drilling operation of the constellation mississippian well that is currently drilling from the same pad as the first three wells 
the enterprise well reached its total depth of  feet md  and is scheduled to be perforated and tested in the hunton formation 
previously  the constellation well also reached total depth and is scheduled for testing in the near term 
initially  it is anticipated that the hunton wells will produce primarily water with small amounts of natural gas and gradually increase to commercial quantities of natural gas with less water over a period of months 
the company  which will operate the field  owns approximately  acres in the area and has targeted potential reserves for this play of approximately to bcfe  gross unrisked 
meridian will own approximately working interest 
unconventional resource plays 
in the delaware basin  the company and its joint venture partner are currently evaluating recently acquired d data and older re processed d data from the area 
targeted formations are the barnett and woodford shale sections which range between  and  feet 
meridian s joint venture partner will operate substantially all of the drilling and production for the project 
the group owns approximately  acres in the area and anticipates that it will drill a minimum of two wells during this will represent approximately of the company s exploration and development budget 
in the new albany shale play in the illinois basin  the company continues to acquire leases and currently owns an approximate  acre lease position 
the primary target formation is the new albany shale at a depth generally between  and  feet with an expected average thickness of feet 
drilling plans for the initial wells in the area are being evaluated 
the company s working interest in the play is with meridian as operator 
in the palo duro basin play  the company owns approximately  gross acres in floyd and motley counties  texas 
the primary target formation is the pennsylvanian shale between  and  feet with an estimated average shale thickness of  feet 
several operators in the basin are in various stages of testing optimal drilling and completion techniques for wells in the area 
an operator has recently reported drilling and completing a successful well that is immediately adjacent a portion of the company s acreage 
the company is currently evaluating the development of the basin and its plans for the play 
meridian currently owns between and of the working interest and is the operator 
capital expenditure plans for meridian s board of directors has approved the capital spending budget of approximately million for new prospect opportunities  ranging in depths from shallow to deep 
this amount includes approximately million for the purchase of one drilling rig previously discussed 
based on current projections  these expenditures are within the company s expected operating cash flows including cash on hand and allow the company the flexibility to take on additional prospects  acquisitions or joint ventures as the opportunities are presented or developed throughout the year 
industry conditions 
our revenues  profitability and cash flow are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas 
oil and natural gas prices have been extremely volatile in recent years and are affected by many factors outside of our control 
the average price we received during the year ended december  was per mcfe compared to per mcfe during the year ended december  fluctuations in prevailing prices for oil and natural gas have several important consequences to us  including affecting the level of cash flow received from our producing properties  the timing of exploration of certain prospects and our access to capital markets  which could impact our revenues  profitability and ability to maintain or increase our exploration and development program 
refer to item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  for a discussion of commodity price risk management activities utilized to mitigate a portion of the near term effects of this exposure to price volatility 
results of operations year ended december   compared to year ended december  oil and natural gas revenues  which include oil and natural gas hedging activities see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein  during the twelve months ended december   decreased million as compared to revenues due to a decrease in production volumes primarily from natural production declines  partially offset by a increase in average commodity prices on a natural gas equivalent basis and new discoveries brought on between the comparable periods 
our average daily production decreased from mmcfe during to mmcfe for oil and natural gas production volume totaled  mmcfe for  compared to  mmcfe for during  the company s drilling activity was primarily focused in the east texas project area  the biloxi marshlands project area and the terrebonne parish area of south louisiana

operating expenses 
oil and natural gas operating expenses on an aggregate basis increased million to million in  compared to million in on a unit basis  lease operating expenses increased per mcfe to per mcfe for the year from per mcfe for the year oil and natural gas operating expenses increased primarily due to additional properties acquired and wells drilled since last year  industry wide increases in service costs and significantly higher insurance costs resulting from last year s hurricane season 
the company s insurance rates increased by more than three times the previous year s annual premiums and represented million of the increase for the comparable periods 
the company anticipates that the higher insurance costs will continue in effect for the foreseeable future 
severance and ad valorem taxes 
severance and ad valorem taxes increased million to million in  compared to million in  primarily because of an increase in oil prices and a higher natural gas tax rate  partially offset by a decrease in oil and natural gas production 
meridian s oil and natural gas production is primarily from louisiana and is therefore subject to louisiana severance tax 
the severance tax rates for louisiana are of gross oil revenues and per mcf effective july  for natural gas 
for the first six months of  and the last six months of  the rate was per mcf for natural gas  an increase from per mcf for the first half of on an equivalent unit of production basis  severance and ad valorem taxes increased to per mcfe for from per mcfe for depletion and depreciation

on a unit basis  depletion and depreciation expenses increased to per mcfe for  compared to per mcfe for depletion and depreciation expense on a per mcfe basis increased primarily due to the impact of negative reserve revisions during the year  an overall industry wide increase in drilling  completion and facility costs  and upward revisions of future development costs 
as a result of the below referenced ceiling test write down  the company s future depletion rate per unit is expected to decrease from the levels 
impairment of long lived assets 
a decline in oil and natural gas prices as of september   resulted in the company recognizing a non cash impairment totaling million million after tax of its oil and natural gas properties under the full cost method of accounting 
additionally  the effect of this write down is projected to result in a decrease in the company s anticipated future depletion rate

hurricane damage repairs 
this expense of million in and million in is related to damages incurred from hurricanes katrina and rita  primarily related to the company s insurance deductible and repair costs in excess of insured values 
due to the extensive damage throughout the area and the limited resources available for repairs  significant cost increases were experienced by the industry 
the actual repair costs were higher than originally estimated and exceeded our claim limits and therefore resulted in increased expense 
additionally  a portion of the expenses resulted from changes in damage classifications with different insurance coverage 
the final claim settlement negotiations were concluded in february  and expenses have been adjusted to reflect the forthcoming settlement payment

liquidity and capital resources cash flows 
net cash flows provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
changes in assets and liabilities was million primarily attributable to the reduction in accounts receivable which includes the collection in of hurricane insurance claim proceeds coupled with receipts of oil and natural gas revenue receivables including the impact of lower commodity pricing 
this was partially offset by the reduction in liabilities for amounts due to affiliates  revenues and royalty payable and asset retirement obligations 
net cash flows used in investing activities were million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  this slight decrease was due to higher expenditures for property and equipment  offset by the sale of property in net cash flows provided by financing activities were million for the year ended december   as compared to net cash flows used in financing activities of million for primarily from the elimination of dividends on preferred stock 
current credit facility 
on december   the company amended its credit facility to provide for a four year million senior secured credit facility the credit facility with fortis capital corp  as administrative agent  sole lead arranger and bookrunner  comerica bank as syndication agent  and union bank of california as documentation agent 
bank of nova scotia  allied irish banks plc  rzb finance llc and standards bank plc completed the syndication group 
the current borrowing base under the credit facility is million and it was reaffirmed by the syndication group effective october  as of december   outstanding borrowings under the credit facility totaled million 
the credit facility is subject to semi annual borrowing base redeterminations on april and october of each year 
in addition to the scheduled semi annual borrowing base redeterminations  the lenders or the company have the right to redetermine the borrowing base at any time  provided that no party can request more than one such redetermination between the regularly scheduled borrowing base redeterminations 
the determination of our borrowing base is subject to a number of factors  including quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves  the banks price assumptions and other various factors unique to each member bank 
our lenders can redetermine the borrowing base to a lower level than the current borrowing base if they determine that our oil and natural gas reserves  at the time of redetermination  are inadequate to support the borrowing base then in effect 
obligations under the credit facility are secured by pledges of outstanding capital stock of the company s subsidiaries and by a first priority lien on not less than in the case of an event of default of its present value of proved oil and natural gas properties 
in addition  the company is required to deliver to the lenders and maintain satisfactory title opinions covering not less than of the present value of proved oil and natural gas properties 
the credit facility also contains other restrictive covenants  including  among other items  maintenance of certain financial ratios  restrictions on cash dividends on common stock and under certain circumstances preferred stock  limitations on the redemption of preferred stock  limitations on repurchases of common stock and an unqualified audit report on the company s consolidated financial statements  all of which the company is in compliance 
under the credit facility  the company may secure either i a an alternative base rate loan that bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the administrative agent s prime rate  or b federal funds based rate plus of  plus an additional to depending on the ratio of the aggregate outstanding loans and letters of credit to the borrowing base or  ii a eurodollar base rate loan that bears interest  generally  at a rate per annum equal to the london interbank offered rate libor plus to  depending on the ratio of the aggregate outstanding loans and letters of credit to the borrowing base

capital expenditures 
capital expenditures in consisted of million of which million was funded by the issuance of common stock for property and equipment additions related to exploration and development of various prospects  including leases  seismic data acquisitions  production facilities  and related drilling and workover activities and property acquisitions 
our strategy is to blend exploration drilling activities with high confidence workover and development projects selected from our broad asset inventory in order to capitalize on periods of high commodity prices 
the capital expenditures plan is currently forecast at approximately million 
the final projects will be determined based on a variety of factors  including prevailing prices for oil and natural gas  our expectations as to future pricing and the level of cash flow from operations 
we currently anticipate funding the plan utilizing cash flow from operations and cash on hand 
when appropriate  excess cash flow from operations beyond that needed for the capital expenditures plan may be used to de lever the company by development of exploration discoveries  direct payment of debt  or the repurchase of common stock

share repurchase program 
the company has authorized a new share repurchase program 
under the program  the company may repurchase in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions up to million worth of common shares per year over the next three years 
the timing  volume  and nature of share repurchases will be at the discretion of management  depending on market conditions  applicable securities laws  and other factors 
during february  the lenders in the credit facility unanimously approved an amendment increasing the available limit for the company s repurchase of its common stock from million to million annually 
the amendment contained restrictive covenants on the company s ability to repurchase its common stock including i the company cannot utilize funds under the credit facility to fund any stock repurchases and ii immediately prior to any repurchase  availability under the credit facility must be equal to at least of the then effective borrowing base 
the share repurchase program is scheduled to begin as soon as reasonably practical 
the program does not require the company to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be modified  suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice 
the company expects repurchases to be funded by available cash 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operation are based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the following summarizes several of our critical accounting policies 
see a complete list of significant accounting policies in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
use of estimates 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  if any  at the date of the financial statements 
the company analyzes its estimates  including those related to oil and natural gas revenues  bad debts  oil and natural gas properties  marketable securities  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment 
the company follows the full cost method of accounting for its investments in oil and natural gas properties 
all costs incurred with the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties  including unproductive wells  are capitalized 
under the full cost method of accounting  such costs may be incurred both prior to or after the acquisition of a property and include lease acquisitions  geological and geophysical services  drilling  completion and equipment 
included in capitalized costs are general and administrative costs that are directly related to acquisition  exploration and development activities  and which are not related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
for the years   and  such capitalized costs totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
general and administrative costs related to production and general overhead are expensed as incurred 
proceeds from the sale of oil and natural gas properties are credited to the full cost pool  except in transactions involving a significant quantity of reserves or where the proceeds received from the sale would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves  in which case a gain or loss would be recognized 
future development  site restoration  and dismantlement and abandonment costs  net of salvage values  are estimated property by property based upon current economic conditions and are included in our amortization of our oil and natural gas property costs 
the provision for depletion and amortization of oil and natural gas properties is computed by the unit of production method 
under this computation  the total unamortized costs of oil and natural gas properties including future development  site restoration  and dismantlement and abandonment costs  net of salvage value  excluding costs of unproved properties  are divided by the total estimated units of proved oil and natural gas reserves at the beginning of the period to determine the depletion rate 
this rate is multiplied by the physical units of oil and natural gas produced during the period 
changes in the quantities of our reserves could significantly impact the company s provision for depletion and amortization of oil and natural gas properties 
a decrease in reserves would have increased our provision for the year by approximately  however  a increase in our reserves would have decreased our provision for the year by approximately 
the cost of unevaluated oil and natural gas properties not being amortized is assessed quarterly to determine whether such properties have been impaired 
in determining impairment  an evaluation is performed on current drilling results  lease expiration dates  current oil and natural gas industry conditions  and available geological and geophysical information 
any impairment assessed is added to the cost of proved properties being amortized 
at december   we had million allocated to unevaluated oil and natural gas properties 
a decrease in the unevaluated oil and natural gas properties balance would have increased our provision for depletion and amortization of oil and natural gas properties by approximately and a increase would have decreased our provision by approximately for the year ended december  full cost ceiling test 
at the end of each quarter  the unamortized cost of oil and natural gas properties  after deducting the asset retirement obligation  net of related deferred income taxes  is limited to the sum of the estimated future net revenues from proved properties using period end prices  after giving effect to cash flow hedge positions  discounted at  and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties adjusted for related income tax effects 
the calculation of the ceiling test and the provision for depletion and amortization are based on estimates of proved reserves 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting the future rates of production  timing  and plan of development 
the accuracy of any reserves estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
results of drilling  testing  and production subsequent to the date of the estimate may justify a revision of such estimate 
accordingly  reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
accordingly  based on september   pricing of per mcf of natural gas and per barrel of oil  the company recognized in the third quarter of a non cash impairment of million million after tax of the company s oil and natural gas properties under the full cost method of accounting 
due to the imprecision in estimating oil and natural gas revenues as well as the potential volatility in oil and natural gas prices and their effect on the carrying value of our proved oil and natural gas reserves  there can be no assurance that write downs in the future will not be required as a result of factors that may negatively affect the present value of proved oil and natural gas reserves and the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties  including volatile oil and natural gas prices  downward revisions in estimated proved oil and natural gas reserve quantities and unsuccessful drilling activities 
at december   we had a cushion ie the excess of the ceiling over our capitalized costs of million before tax 
a increase in prices would have increased our cushion by approximately 
a decrease in prices would have decreased our cushion by approximately to a level requiring a write down 
our hedging program would reduce some of the impact of a price decline 
price risk management activities 
the company follows the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities which requires that changes in the derivatives fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific cash flow hedge accounting criteria are met 
the statement also establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be reported in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
cash flow hedge accounting for qualifying hedges allows the gains and losses on derivatives to offset related results on the hedged item in the earnings statements and requires that a company formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
the company s results of operations and operating cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for oil and natural gas 
to mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes  the company has entered into various derivative contracts 
these contracts allow the company to predict with greater certainty the effective oil and natural gas prices to be received for our hedged production 
although derivatives often fail to achieve effectiveness for accounting purposes  our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving the risk management objectives for which they were intended 
these contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges as provided by sfas and any changes in fair value are recorded in other comprehensive income until earnings are affected by the variability in cash flows of the designated hedged item 
any changes in fair value resulting from the ineffectiveness of the hedge are reported in the consolidated statement of operations as a component of revenues 
the company recognized a gain of  during the year ended december   a loss of  during the year ended december   and a gain of  during the year ended december  as of december   the estimated fair value of the company s oil and natural gas contracts was an unrealized gain of million million net of tax which is recognized in other comprehensive income 
based upon december   oil and natural gas commodity prices  approximately million of the gain deferred in other comprehensive income could potentially increase gross revenues in the contract agreements expire at various dates through july  net settlements under these contract agreements increased decreased oil and natural gas revenues by   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  for additional discussion of disclosures about market risk 
fair value of financial instruments 
our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  and bank borrowings 
the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the highly liquid nature of these short term instruments 
the fair values of the bank borrowings approximate the carrying amounts as of december  and  and were determined based upon variable interest rates currently available to us for borrowings with similar terms 
new accounting pronouncements 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes and interpretation of sfas no 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company is in the process of evaluating fin  but does not believe that its implementation will have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operation in any period 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
due to diversity in practice among registrants  sab expresses sec staff views regarding the process by which misstatements in financial statements are evaluated for purposes of determining whether financial statement restatement is necessary 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending after november   and early application is encouraged 
the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosure about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  the company is evaluating the impact  if any  that sfas will have on our financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and hedging contracts 
a discussion of the market risk exposure in financial instruments follows 
interest rates we are subject to interest rate risk on our long term fixed interest rate debt and variable interest rate borrowings 
our long term borrowings primarily consist of borrowings under the credit facility 
since interest charged on borrowings under the credit facility floats with prevailing interest rates except for the applicable interest period for eurodollar loans  the carrying value of borrowings under the credit facility should approximate the fair market value of such debt 
changes in interest rates  however  will change the cost of borrowing 
assuming million remains borrowed under the credit facility  we estimate our annual interest expense will change by million for each basis point change in the applicable interest rates utilized under the credit facility 
hedging contracts from time to time  meridian addresses market risk by selecting instruments whose value fluctuations correlate strongly with the underlying commodity being hedged 
from time to time  we may enter into derivative contracts to hedge the price risks associated with a portion of anticipated future oil and natural gas production 
while the use of hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  it may also limit future gains from favorable movements 
under these agreements  payments are received or made based on the differential between a fixed and a variable product price 
these agreements are settled in cash at or prior to expiration or exchanged for physical delivery contracts 
meridian does not obtain collateral to support the agreements  but monitors the financial viability of counter parties and believes its credit risk is minimal on these transactions 
in the event of nonperformance  we would be exposed to price risk 
meridian has some risk of accounting loss since the price received for the product at the actual physical delivery point may differ from the prevailing price at the delivery point required for settlement of the hedging transaction 
all of the company s current hedging contracts are in the form of costless collars 
the costless collars provide the company with a lower limit floor price and an upper limit ceiling price on the hedged volumes 
the floor price represents the lowest price the company will receive for the hedged volumes while the ceiling price represents the highest price the company will receive for the hedged volumes 
the costless collars are settled monthly based on the nymex futures contract 
the notional amount is equal to the total net volumetric hedge position of the company during the periods presented 
the positions effectively hedge approximately of our proved developed natural gas production and of our proved developed oil production during the respective terms of the hedging agreements 
the fair values of the hedges are based on the difference between the strike price and the nymex future prices for the applicable trading months 
the fair value of our hedging agreements is recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities
