table of contents our financial performance for fiscal was largely due to strong service revenue growth of over the prior fiscal year 
this growth in service revenue was attributable to client base growth  higher check volume  price increases  and growth in the utilization of our ancillary services 
our financial performance was also positively impacted by the effects of increases in interest rates earned on funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios 
our combined interest on funds held for clients and corporate investment income increased for fiscal and earned an average rate of return of  an increase from for fiscal and for fiscal the federal funds rate was raised basis points in fiscal and was as of may  the impact of changing interest rates and related risks is discussed in more detail in the market risk factors section  contained in item a of this form k

expanded our employee benefit administration service offerings with the introduction of cobra administration services and state continuation services  which meet federal and state mandates for temporary continuation of health care coverage for employees and their families 
business acquisitions we may supplement our growth from time to time through strategic acquisitions when opportunities arise

focus on customer service we have always focused on customer service and the maximization of client retention 
for fiscal  customer survey results were at an all time high  and client retention was at a record level of slightly more than of our beginning client base 
financial position as of may   we maintained a strong financial position with cash and total corporate investments of billion 
our primary source of cash is our ongoing operations 
cash flow from operations increased to million for fiscal historically  we have funded our operations  capital purchases  and dividend payments from our operating activities 
it is anticipated that cash and current corporate investment balances of million as of may   along with projected operating cash flows  will support our normal business operations  capital purchases  and dividend payments for the foreseeable future 
for further analysis of our results of operations for fiscal years   and  and our financial position as of may   refer to the tables and analysis in the results of operations and liquidity and capital resources sections of this item and the discussion in the critical accounting policies section of this item stock based compensation costs effective june  the adoption date  we adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
revised sfas no 
r  share based payment 
this statement requires that all stock based awards to employees  including grants of stock options  be recognized as compensation costs in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant 
these costs are recognized as expense in the consolidated statements of income over the requisite service period 
we adopted this standard using the modified prospective transition method  and accordingly  results for the prior periods have not been restated 
comparisons between the results of operations for fiscal and fiscal are impacted by this method of adoption 
refer to note b of the notes to consolidated financial statements  contained in item of this form k  for additional information regarding stock based compensation arrangements 
prior to the adoption date  we accounted for stock based compensation arrangements under the intrinsic value method described in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
accordingly  no compensation costs were recognized for stock option grants because the exercise price of the stock options granted was equal to the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant 

table of contents the impacts to the results of operations from recognition of stock based compensation costs under sfas no 
r are as follows year ended in millions  except per share amounts may  operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses total expenses income before income taxes income taxes net income basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share excess tax benefit related to exercise of stock options reflected in cash flows from financing activities as of may   the total unrecognized compensation cost for all unvested stock based awards was million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
the impact on future periods may change based on the issuance of additional stock based awards as allowed under the paychex  inc stock incentive plan  as amended and restated effective october  for grants of stock options  we estimate the fair value at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
for grants of restricted stock  which were first granted in july  the fair value is equal to the closing market price of the underlying common stock as of the date of grant 
stock based compensation costs for any awards granted subsequent to the adoption date are recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period to better align the costs with the employee services provided 
compensation costs for stock based awards granted prior to the adoption date will continue to be recognized on an accelerated amortization schedule related to the graded vesting terms of the grant 
as part of the adoption of sfas no 
r  we did an in depth review of all of our assumptions used in calculating the fair value under a black scholes option pricing model 
for grants subsequent to the adoption date  we calculated the estimated volatility factor based on a combination of historical volatility using weekly stock prices and implied market volatility 
we incorporated implied volatility as it is generally more reflective of both historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility 
prior to the adoption date  we used historical volatility based on monthly stock prices 
the expected option life of our stock option grants is determined from historical exercise behavior 
upon adoption of sfas no 
r  we are required to estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest 
previously  in our pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
 we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
our assumptions for forfeitures were determined based on type of award and historical experience 
the assumptions of volatility  expected option life  and forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise behavior  stock price trends  and changes to types or provisions of stock based awards 
any change in one or more of these assumptions can have a material impact on the estimated fair value of an award and on stock based compensation costs recognized in our results of operations 

table of contents outlook our current outlook for the fiscal year ending may  fiscal is based upon current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes 
projected revenue and net income growth is as follows payroll service revenue human resource services revenue total service revenue interest on funds held for clients total revenue corporate investment income net income the effective income tax rate is expected to be approximately 
purchases of property and equipment in fiscal are expected to be in the range of million to million 
fiscal depreciation expense is projected to be approximately million  and we project amortization of intangible assets for fiscal to be approximately million 
we estimate that the earnings effect of a basis point change in interest rates basis points for tax exempt investments at the beginning of fiscal would be in the range of million to million for fiscal results of operations summary of results of operations for the fiscal years ended may in millions  except per share amounts change change revenue payroll service revenue human resource services revenue total service revenue interest on funds held for clients total revenue combined operating and sg a expenses operating income as a of total revenue investment income  net income before income taxes as a of total revenue income taxes net income as a of total revenue diluted earnings per share

revenue payroll service revenue increased for fiscal and for fiscal to billion and billion  respectively 
the increases in payroll service revenue were primarily attributable to client base growth  higher check volume  price increases  and growth in utilization of our ancillary payroll services 
as of may   of all clients utilized our payroll tax administration services  compared with as of may  and as of may  we believe our client utilization percentage of these services is near maturity 
our employee payment services were utilized by of our clients as of may   compared with as of may  and as of may  nearly all new clients purchase our payroll tax administration services and more than of new clients select a form of our employee payment services 
human resource services revenue increased for fiscal and for fiscal to million and million  respectively 
revenue from time and attendance products  included in human resource services  increased for fiscal and for fiscal to million and million  respectively 
additionally  growth was generated from the following retirement services client base increased to  clients for fiscal and to  clients for fiscal  comprehensive human resource outsourcing services client employees increased to  client employees served for fiscal and to  client employees served for fiscal  
table of contents workers compensation insurance client base increased to  clients for fiscal and to  clients for fiscal the asset value of the retirement services client employees funds increased to billion for fiscal and to billion for fiscal the increase in interest on funds held for clients for fiscal compared to fiscal  and for fiscal compared to fiscal was the result of higher average interest rates earned and higher average portfolio balances 
the higher average portfolio balances in both fiscal and fiscal were driven by client base growth  wage inflation  check volume growth within our current client base  and increased utilization of our payroll tax administration services and employee payment services 
see the market risk factors section  contained in item a of this form k  for more information on changing rates 
combined operating and sg a expenses the following table summarizes total combined operating and selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for the fiscal year ended may in millions change change compensation related expenses  including stock based compensation costs facilities expenses depreciation of property and equipment amortization of intangible assets expense charge to increase litigation reserve other expenses total operating and sg a expenses stock based compensation costs from the adoption of sfas no 
r  included in compensation related expenses  were million for fiscal during fiscal  we recorded an expense charge of million to increase our litigation reserve to account for settlements and for anticipated costs relating to pending legal matters 
refer to note l of the notes to consolidated financial statements  contained in item of this form k  for additional information on pending legal matters 
the stock based compensation costs and the expense charge to increase the litigation reserve accounted for of the increase in total expenses for fiscal most of the remaining increase for fiscal and the increase for fiscal were accounted for by increases in personnel and other costs related to retaining clients  promoting new services  and creating more efficient systems for selling and servicing through new and enhanced technology 
in addition  for fiscal  total expenses were affected by a strong sales year as our sales force exceeded its targets resulting in higher than normal levels of sales expense 
as of may   we had approximately  employees compared with approximately  as of may  and  as of may  depreciation expense is primarily related to buildings  furniture and fixtures  data processing equipment  and software 
increases in depreciation expense were due to higher levels of capital expenditures as we invested in technology and continued to grow our business 
amortization of intangible assets is primarily related to client lists obtained from previous acquisitions  which are amortized using either straight line or accelerated methods 
amortization increased in fiscal mainly due to the termination of our client servicing arrangement with new england business services  inc nebs and the purchasing of the right to service the related clients 
other expenses include items such as delivery  forms and supplies  communications  travel and entertainment  professional services  and other costs incurred to support our business 
operating income operating income growth was for fiscal and for fiscal the increases in operating income for fiscal and fiscal were attributable to the factors previously discussed 
in managing and evaluating the results of our day to day operations  we believe that operating income excluding certain items is an appropriate measure 
we also use this measure in evaluating management s performance in generating those results 
operating income excluding interest on funds held for clients  stock 
table of contents based compensation costs  and the expense charge to increase the litigation reserve is as follows for the year ended may in millions change change operating income excluding interest on funds held for clients stock based compensation costs expense charge to increase the litigation reserve operating income  net of certain items investment income  net investment income  net primarily represents earnings from our cash and cash equivalents and investments in available for sale securities 
investment income does not include interest on funds held for clients  which is included in total revenue 
the increase in investment income for fiscal compared with fiscal  and for fiscal compared with fiscal  is mainly due to higher average interest rates earned and higher average portfolio balances resulting from investment of cash generated from ongoing operations 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was for fiscal  compared with for fiscal  and for fiscal the decreases in our effective income tax rate were primarily the result of higher levels of tax exempt income  which is derived primarily from municipal debt securities in the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios  and a lower effective state income tax rate 
for fiscal  the effective tax rate was impacted by non deductible compensation related to incentive stock option grants 
see note h of the notes to consolidated financial statements  contained in item of this form k  for additional disclosures on income taxes 
net income net income growth was for fiscal and for fiscal to million and million  respectively 
these increases were attributable to the factors previously discussed  including  in fiscal  the increase to the litigation reserve of million and the million of stock based compensation costs due to the june  accounting standard adoption 
liquidity and capital resources as of may   we had billion in cash and total corporate investments 
cash and current corporate investments of million and projected operating cash flows are expected to support our normal business operations  capital purchases  and dividend payments for the foreseeable future

commitments and contractual obligations we have unused borrowing capacity available under four uncommitted  secured  short term lines of credit at market rates of interest with financial institutions as follows financial institution amount available expiration date jp morgan chase bank  na million february bank of america  na million february pnc bank  national association million february wells fargo bank  national association million february our credit facilities are evidenced by promissory notes and are secured by separate pledge security agreements by and between paychex  inc and each of the financial institutions the lenders  pursuant to which we have granted each of the lenders a security interest in certain of our investment securities accounts 
the collateral is maintained in a pooled custody account pursuant to the terms of a control agreement and is to be 
table of contents administered under an intercreditor agreement among the lenders 
under certain circumstances  individual lenders may require that collateral be transferred from the pooled account into segregated accounts for the benefit of such individual lenders 
the primary uses of the lines of credit would be to meet short term funding requirements related to deposit account overdrafts and client fund deposit obligations arising from electronic payment transactions on behalf of our clients in the ordinary course of business  if necessary 
no amounts were outstanding against these lines of credit during fiscal or as of may  as of may   we had irrevocable standby letters of credit outstanding totaling million  required to secure commitments for certain of our insurance policies 
these letters of credit expire at various dates between december and july the letters are secured by securities held in our corporate investment portfolio  including a million letter of credit for which funds have been segregated into a separate account 
no amounts were outstanding on these letters of credit during fiscal or as of may  we have entered into various operating leases and purchase obligations that  under united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap  are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as of may  the table below summarizes our estimated annual payment obligations under these commitments  as well as other contractual obligations shown as other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of may  payments due by period less than more than in millions total year years years years operating leases purchase obligations other liabilities total operating leases are primarily for office space and equipment used in our branch operations 
these amounts do not include future payments under redundant leases related to the acquisitions of advantage payroll services inc advantage and interpay inc  which are included in the table above with other liabilities 
purchase obligations include our estimate of the minimum outstanding commitments under purchase orders to buy goods and services and legally binding contractual arrangements with future payment obligations 
included in the total purchase obligations is million of commitments to purchase capital assets 
amounts actually paid under certain of these arrangements may be higher due to variable components of these agreements 
the obligations shown as other liabilities represent business acquisition reserves and are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as of may  with million in other current liabilities and million in other long term liabilities 
certain deferred compensation plan obligations and other long term liabilities amounting to million are excluded because the timing of actual payments cannot be specifically or reasonably determined due to the variability in assumptions required to project the timing of future payments 
advantage has license agreements with independently owned associate offices associates  which are responsible for selling and marketing advantage payroll services and performing certain operational functions  while paychex  inc and advantage provide all centralized back office payroll processing and payroll tax administration services 
under these arrangements  advantage pays the associates commissions based on processing activity for the related clients 
since the actual amounts of future payments are uncertain  obligations under these arrangements are not included in the table above 
commission expense for the associates for fiscal and fiscal was million and million  respectively 
we guarantee performance of service on annual maintenance contracts for clients who financed their service contracts through a third party 
in the normal course of business  we make representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients 
in addition  we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors  which require us to defend and  if necessary  indemnify these individuals for certain pending or future legal claims as they relate to their services provided to us 
historically  there have been no material losses related to such guarantees and indemnifications 

table of contents we currently self insure the deductible portion of various insured exposures under certain of our employee benefit plans 
our estimated loss exposure under these insurance arrangements is recorded in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
historically  the amounts accrued have not been material

the increase in non cash adjustments to net income for fiscal was primarily attributable to stock based compensation costs of million and the expense charge of million to increase the litigation reserve 
the fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities between periods were primarily related to the timing of accounts receivable billing and collection  and timing of payments for compensation  peo payroll  income tax  and other liabilities

critical accounting policies note a to the consolidated financial statements  contained in item of this form k  discusses the significant accounting policies of paychex  inc our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience  future expectations  and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances 
actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates 
certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 
revenue recognition service revenue is recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably 
table of contents assured 
certain processing services are provided under annual service arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the annual service period 
our service revenue is largely attributable to payroll related processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed 
the revenue earned from delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in service revenue  and the costs for delivery are included in operating expenses on the consolidated statements of income 
peo revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net of direct costs billed and incurred  which include wages  taxes  benefit premiums  and claims of peo worksite employees 
direct costs billed and incurred were billion  billion  and billion for fiscal   and  respectively 
revenue from certain time and attendance solutions is recognized using the residual method when all of the following are present persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  typically a non cancelable sales order  delivery is complete for the software and hardware  the fee is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
maintenance contracts are generally purchased by our clients in conjunction with their purchase of certain time and attendance solutions 
revenue from these maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
in certain situations we allow a client a right of return or refund 
we maintain an allowance for returns  which is based on historical data 
the allowance is reviewed periodically for adequacy with any adjustment to revenue reflected in the results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified 
interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax administration services and for employee payment services  and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees 
these collections from clients are typically remitted up to days after receipt  with some items extending to days 
the interest earned on these funds is included in total revenue on the consolidated statements of income because the collection  holding  and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services 
interest on funds held for clients also includes net realized gains and losses from the sales of available for sale securities 
peo workers compensation insurance workers compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims underwritten by us 
these reserves include estimates for reported losses  plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims 
in establishing the workers compensation insurance reserves  we use an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle the claims 
estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and actuarial loss projections  and is subject to change due to multiple factors  including social and economic trends  changes in legal liability law  and damage awards  all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  final claim settlements may vary from our present estimates  particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future 
we regularly review the adequacy of our estimated workers compensation insurance reserves 
adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in the results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified 
such adjustments could possibly be significant  reflecting any variety of new and adverse or favorable trends 
in fiscal and fiscal  workers compensation insurance for peo worksite employees was provided based on claims paid as incurred 
our maximum individual claims liability was  under both the fiscal policy and the fiscal policy 

table of contents we had recorded the following amounts on our consolidated balance sheets for workers compensation claims as of may  in millions prepaid expense current liability long term liability valuation of investments our investments in available for sale securities are reported at market value 
unrealized gains related to increases in the market value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the market value are included in comprehensive income  net of tax  as reported on our consolidated statements of stockholders equity 
however  changes in the market value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or impairment is recognized 
realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security s cost basis 
on our consolidated statements of income  realized gains and losses from funds held for clients are included in interest on funds held for clients  whereas realized gains and losses from corporate investments are included in investment income  net 
we are exposed to credit risk in connection with our available for sale securities from the possible inability of borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds 
we attempt to mitigate this risk by investing primarily in high credit quality securities with aaa and aa ratings  and short term securities with an a rating  and by limiting amounts that can be invested in any single issuer 
we periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is other than temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns  which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made 
in making this judgment  we evaluate  among other things  the duration and extent to which the market value of an investment is less than its cost  the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment  and our ability and intent to hold the investment until the earlier of market price recovery or maturity 
our assessment that an investment is not other than temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumption related to any particular investment 
goodwill and intangible assets for business combinations  we assign estimated fair values to all assets and liabilities acquired  including intangible assets  such as customer lists  certain license agreements  trade names  and non compete agreements 
the assignment of fair values to acquired assets and liabilities and the determination of useful lives for depreciable and amortizable assets requires significant estimates  judgments  and assumptions 
for certain fixed assets  including software and intangible assets  we use the assistance of independent valuation consultants 
the remaining purchase price of the acquired business not assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill 
we have million of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of may   resulting from acquisitions during the fiscal years ended may    and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill not be amortized  but instead tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit 
impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
we perform our annual review in our fiscal fourth quarter 
our business is largely homogeneous and  as a result  substantially all of the goodwill is associated with one reporting unit 
based on the results of our goodwill impairment review  no impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for fiscal or fiscal subsequent to this review  there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of our goodwill balance 
we also test intangible assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
accrual for client fund losses we maintain an accrual for estimated losses associated with our clients inability to meet their payroll obligations 
as part of providing payroll  payroll tax administration services  and employee payment services  we are authorized by the client to initiate money transfers from the client s account for the amount of tax obligations and employees direct deposits 
electronic money fund transfers from client bank 
table of contents accounts are subject to potential risk of loss resulting from clients insufficient funds to cover such transfers 
we evaluate certain uncollected amounts on a specific basis and analyze historical experience for amounts not specifically reviewed to determine the likelihood of recovery from the clients 
contingent liabilities we are subject to various claims and legal matters that arise in the normal course of business 
as of may   we had approximately million of reserves for pending litigation 
based on the application of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  which requires us to record a reserve if we believe an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the probable loss can be reasonably estimated  we deem this amount adequate 
the determination of whether any particular matter involves a probable loss or if the amount of a probable loss can be reasonably estimated requires considerable judgment 
this reserve may change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular matter 
in light of the litigation reserve recorded  we currently believe that resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
however  these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the possibility that the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and our results of operations in the period in which any such effect is recorded 
for additional information regarding pending legal matters  refer to note l in the notes to consolidated financial statements  contained in item of this form k 
stock based compensation costs effective june   we adopted sfas no 
r  which requires that all stock based awards to employees  including grants of stock options  be recognized as compensation costs in our consolidated financial statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant 
we estimate the fair value of stock option grants using a black scholes option pricing model 
this model requires various assumptions as inputs including expected volatility of the paychex stock price and expected option life 
we estimate volatility based on a combination of historical volatility using weekly stock prices and implied market volatility  both over a period equal to the expected option life 
we estimate expected option life based on historical exercise behavior 
under sfas no 
r  we are required to estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest 
our assumptions for forfeitures were determined based on type of award and historical experience 
forfeiture assumptions are adjusted at the point in time a significant change is identified with any catch up adjustment recorded in the period of change  with the final adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to equal actual forfeitures 
the assumptions of volatility  expected option life  and forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise behavior  stock price trends  and changes to type or provisions of stock based awards 
any change in one or more of these assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of an award and on stock based compensation costs recognized in our results of operations 
we have determined that the black scholes option pricing model  as well as the underlying assumptions used in its application  is appropriate in estimating the fair value of stock option grants 
we periodically reassess our assumptions as well as our choice of valuation model  and will reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes available in the future indicating that another model would provide a more accurate estimate of fair value  or if characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change 
income taxes we account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
with the adoption of sfas no 
r in fiscal  we record a deferred tax asset related to the stock based compensation costs recognized for certain stock based awards 
at the time of exercise of non qualified stock options or vesting of restricted stock awards  we account for the resulting tax deduction by reducing our accrued income tax liability with an offset to the deferred tax asset and any excess tax benefit increasing additional paid in capital 
we currently have a sufficient pool of excess tax benefits in additional paid in capital to absorb any deficient tax benefit related to stock based awards

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk factors changes in interest rates and interest rate risk funds held for clients are primarily comprised of short term funds and available for sale securities 
corporate investments are primarily comprised of available for sale securities 
as a result of our operating and investing activities  we are exposed to changes in interest rates that may materially effect our results of operations and financial position 
changes in interest rates will impact the earnings potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in the market value of our longer term available for sale securities 
in seeking to minimize the risks and or costs associated with such activities  we generally direct investments towards high credit quality  fixed rate municipal and government securities and manage the available for sale securities to a benchmark duration of two and one half to three years 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk 
our investment portfolios and the earnings from these portfolios have been impacted by the fluctuations in interest rates 
during fiscal  the average interest rate earned on our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios was compared with for fiscal and for fiscal short term rates rose steadily throughout fiscal  with the federal funds rate increasing basis points to as of may  the federal funds rate increased basis points in fiscal and was as of may  while interest rates are rising  the full benefit of higher interest rates will not immediately be reflected in net income due to the interaction of long and short term interest rate changes as discussed below 
during a rising interest rate environment  the increases in interest rates increase earnings from our short term investments  and over time will increase earnings from our longer term available for sale securities 
earnings from the available for sale securities  which as of may  had an average duration of years  excluding the impact of auction rate securities and vrdns that are tied to short term interest rates  would not reflect increases in interest rates until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are reinvested at higher rates 
the cost and market value of available for sale securities that have stated maturities as of may  are shown below by contractual maturity 
expected maturities can differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties 
may  in millions cost market value maturity date due in one year or less due after one year through three years due after three years through five years due after five years total vrdns and auction rate securities are primarily categorized as due after five years in the table above as the contractual maturities on these securities are typically to years 
although these securities are issued as long term securities  they are priced and traded as short term instruments because of the liquidity provided through the auction or tender feature 

table of contents the following table summarizes the changes in the federal funds rate over the past three fiscal years federal funds rate beginning of fiscal year rate increase first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter federal funds rate end of fiscal year three year aaa municipal securities yields end of fiscal year calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to daily interest rate changes  seasonal variations in investment balances  actual duration of short term and available for sale securities  the proportional mix of taxable and tax exempt investments  and changes in tax exempt municipal rates versus taxable investment rates  which are not synchronized or simultaneous 
subject to these factors  a basis point change in taxable interest rates generally affects our tax exempt interest rates by approximately basis points 
our total investment portfolio funds held for clients and corporate investments averaged approximately billion for fiscal our normal and anticipated allocation is approximately invested in short term securities and available for sale securities with an average duration of days  and invested in available for sale securities with an average duration of two and one half to three years 
the combined funds held for clients and corporate available for sale securities reflected a net unrealized loss position of million as of may   compared with a net unrealized loss position of million as of may  during fiscal  the net unrealized loss position ranged from million to million 
during fiscal  the net unrealized loss position ranged from million to million 
the net unrealized loss position of our investment portfolios was approximately million as of july  as of may  and may   we had billion and billion  respectively  invested in available for sale securities at market value 
excluding auction rate securities and vrdns classified as available for sale securities which are tied to short term interest rates  the weighted average yields to maturity were and  as of may  and may   respectively 
assuming a hypothetical increase in both short term and longer term interest rates of basis points  the resulting potential decrease in market value for our portfolio of securities as of may   would be approximately million 
conversely  a corresponding decrease in interest rates would result in a comparable increase in market value 
this hypothetical decrease or increase in the market value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the portfolio s recorded value  with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders equity 
these fluctuations in market value would have no related or immediate impact on the results of operations  unless any declines in market value were considered to be other than temporary 
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in connection with our available for sale securities from the possible inability of borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds 
we attempt to mitigate this risk by investing primarily in high credit quality securities with aaa and aa ratings  and short term securities with an a rating  and by limiting amounts that can be invested in any single issuer
