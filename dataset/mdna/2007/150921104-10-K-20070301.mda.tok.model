the following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  and other documents filed by us from time to time with the securities and exchange commission 
overview we are a biotechnology company focused on the development and commercialization of novel biological therapies for patients with cancer 
we are currently developing cell based cancer immunotherapies and oncolytic virus therapies to treat different types of cancer 
our clinical stage cancer programs involve cell or viral based products that have been modified to impart disease fighting characteristics that are not found in conventional chemotherapeutic agents 
as part of our gvax tm cancer immunotherapy programs  we are conducting two phase clinical trials in prostate cancer and phase trials in each of pancreatic cancer and leukemia 
we initiated our phase clinical trials for gvax immunotherapy for prostate cancer in july and june  each under a special protocol assessment spa with the united states food and drug administration fda 
in may  we were granted fast track designation for gvax immunotherapy for prostate cancer by the fda 
fast track designation can potentially facilitate development and expedite the review of bla s 
in our oncolytic virus therapies program  which we are developing in part through a global alliance with novartis ag  we are conducting a multiple dose phase clinical trial of cg in recurrent bladder cancer 
we also have other preclinical oncolytic virus therapy programs  including cg  evaluating potential therapies for multiple types of cancer 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures  which we have prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  income taxes and stock based compensation to be critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition our revenues are derived principally from research and licensing agreements with collaborators 
revenue under such collaboration agreements typically includes up front payments  cost reimbursements  milestone payments and license fees 
we evaluate whether the delivered element under these arrangements has value to our customer on a stand alone basis and whether objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered item exists 
deliverables that do not meet these criteria are treated as one unit of accounting for the purposes of revenue recognition 

table of contents up front payments up front payments from our research collaborations include payments for technology transfer and access rights 
non refundable up front license fees and other payments under collaboration agreements where we continue involvement throughout development are deferred and recognized on a straight line or ratable method  unless we determine that another methodology is more appropriate 
during and  we recognized revenue from a non refundable up front payment under our global alliance with novartis ag for the development of certain oncolytic virus therapies based upon when the underlying development expenses were incurred  rather than a ratable method  as we determined that the expense method was more appropriate for this agreement 
the revenues recorded under the novartis ag alliance approximated the related development expenses that were incurred in the respective periods 
we recognize cost reimbursement revenue under collaborative agreements as the related research and development costs are incurred  as provided for under the terms of these agreements 
milestones payments for milestones that are based on the achievement of substantive and at risk performance criteria are recognized in full upon achievement of the incentive milestone events in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
incentive milestone payments are triggered either by the results of our research efforts or by events external to us  such as regulatory approval to market a product or the achievement of specified sales levels by a marketing partner 
as such  the incentive milestones are substantially at risk at the inception of the agreement  and the amounts of the payments assigned thereto are commensurate with the milestone achieved 
upon the achievement of an incentive milestone event  we have no future performance obligations related to that payment 
license fees non refundable license fees where we have completed all future obligations are recognized as revenue upon execution of the technology licensing agreement when delivery has occurred  collectibility is reasonably assured and the price is fixed and determinable 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with the provision of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes fas 
fas requires recognition of deferred taxes to provide for temporary differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred taxes are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect in the year in which the basis difference is expected to reverse 
we record a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets  when the realization of such deferred income tax assets cannot be determined to be more likely than not 
we establish accruals for tax contingencies when we believe that certain tax positions may be challenged and that our positions may not be fully sustained 
we adjust our tax contingency accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of tax audits  case law and emerging legislation 
in july  the irs issued to us a notice of proposed adjustment nopa seeking to disallow million of net operating losses which were deducted for the fiscal year and seeking a million penalty for substantial underpayment of tax in fiscal we responded to the nopa in september  disagreeing with the conclusions reached by the irs in the nopa and seeking to resolve this matter at the appeals level 
we are currently negotiating with the irs for a conclusion to this matter 
we had previously recorded a liability of million for this and other federal and state tax contingencies  including estimated interest expense  at december   and during the year ended december   we accrued an additional million of interest related to these tax contingencies 
the nature of these tax matters is uncertain and subject to change 
as a result  the amount of our liability for certain of these matters could exceed or be less than the amount of our current estimates  depending on the outcome of these matters 
if we are unsuccessful in defending the tax filing positions that were previously taken  then potentially the liability for federal and state tax contingencies could be significantly higher than the million that has been recorded as of december  an outcome of such matters different than previously estimated could materially impact our financial position or results of operations in the year of resolution 
income tax benefits previously recorded have been based on a determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against these deferred tax assets 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
we considered anticipated future taxable income  and potential tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances 
certain of these determinations require judgment on the part of management 
if we determine that we will be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the carrying value of our net deferred tax 
table of contents assets  adjustments to the deferred tax assets will increase income by reducing tax expense in the period that such determination is reached 
likewise  if we determine that it will not be able to realize all or part of the carrying value of its net deferred tax assets in the future  adjustments to the deferred tax assets will decrease income by increasing tax expense in the period that such determination is reached 
significant estimates are required in determining our income tax benefits 
various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective tax rate 
these factors include  but are not limited to  changes in tax laws and regulations  our future levels of spending for research and development  and changes in our overall level of pre tax earnings or losses 
stock based compensation prior to  we accounted for stock based compensation plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
beginning january   we accounted for employee stock based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment fas r 
under the provisions of fas r  we estimate the fair value of our employee stock awards at the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model  which requires the use of certain subjective assumptions 
when establishing an estimate of the expected term of an award  we consider the vesting period for the award  our historical experience of employee stock option exercises including forfeitures  post vesting termination patterns and the expected volatility 
as required under the accounting rules  we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and  as a result  we are likely to change our valuation assumptions used to value employee stock based awards granted in future periods 
fas r requires that employee stock based compensation costs be recognized over the requisite service period  or the vesting period  in a manner similar to all other forms of compensation paid to employees 
accordingly  in fiscal  we recognized million of stock based compensation as part of our operating expenses with an allocation of million and million  respectively  to research and development and to general and administrative expenses 
we adopted fas r on a modified prospective basis 
the allocation of employee stock based compensation costs to each operating expense line is estimated based on specific employee headcount information at each grant date and revised  if necessary  in future periods if actual employee headcount information differs materially from those estimates 
as a result  the amount of employee stock based compensation costs we record in future periods in each operating expense line may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
as of december   total compensation cost related to nonvested stock options not yet recognized was million  which is expected to be allocated to expense over a weighted average period of months 
there was no stock based compensation expense related to employee stock options and employee stock purchases recognized during fiscal years or see note  organization and summary of significant accounting policies and note  stockholder s equity and stock based compensation of notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report on form k for further information 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with fas and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
additionally  fin provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
this statement became effective for us on january  the cumulative effect of adopting fin will be recorded in retained earnings and other accounts  as applicable 
we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of fin will have on our financial position and results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no

results of operations revenue revenues were million in compared to million in and million in  as shown in the following table in thousands novartis ag sanofi aventis group transkaryotic therapies  inc ceregene  inc since august  other revenues for included million in connection with our gene activation technology license agreement with sanofi aventis group for gene activated erythropoietin  compared to revenues of million in and million in under the same agreement 
we recorded contract revenue of million in both and compared to million in for services provided to ceregene after august   the date as of which our ownership of ceregene became a minority ownership position 
there was no revenue in from novartis ag as the million payment was fully recognized by december  revenues for and included million and million  respectively  from novartis ag in connection with our global alliance for the development and commercialization of oncolytic virus therapies 
we also recognized as other revenue in approximately million in grants received by ceregene on their alzheimer s disease and als research projects during the period it was a consolidated subsidiary 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were million in compared to million in and million in these increases can be attributed to our expanding clinical trials and other product development activities in both our gvax cancer immunotherapy and oncolytic virus therapy programs 
in july  we announced the commencement of our vital trial  which compares gvax prostate cancer immunotherapy to taxotere chemotherapy in patients with advanced prostate cancer without cancer related pain 
in june  we announced the commencement of our vital trial  which compares gvax prostate cancer immunotherapy plus taxotere chemotherapy to taxotere chemotherapy alone in advanced prostate cancer patients with cancer related pain 
in  research and development expenses were primarily ongoing phase clinical trials for our lead product development program  gvax immunotherapy for prostate cancer  and included million in non cash stock based compensation expense related to fas r 
we expect that our research and development expenditures and headcount will increase in future periods to support our most advanced clinical trials  including our two phase clinical trials of gvax immunotherapy for prostate cancer  as well as additional product development activities 
the rate of increase depends on a number of factors  including progress in research and development and clinical trials 
due to the substantial overlap of our research and development activities we do not track costs on a project by project basis 
biopharmaceutical products  such as those being developed by us  may take to years to research  develop and bring to market in the united states 
drug development in the us is a process that includes several steps regulated by the fda 
the process begins with the filing of an ind application  which  if successful  allows opportunity for clinical study of the potential new medicine 
clinical development typically involves three phases of study phase  and costs for each phase are generally larger than the preceding phase  as the size of the clinical trial number of patients grows 
the most significant costs associated with clinical development are the phase trials  as they tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process 
we 
table of contents currently have one product in development for which we have initiated phase studies 
however  the successful development of our products is highly uncertain 
estimates of product completion dates and completion costs can vary significantly for each product and are difficult to predict 
completion of clinical trials  including the vital and vital trials that we initiated in july and june  respectively  may take several years or more 
the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of the product candidate 
however  we estimate that clinical trials of the type we generally conduct are usually completed over the following timelines estimated clinical phase completion period phase years phase years phase years many factors may delay our commencement and speed of completion of clinical trials  including the size and number of patients participating in the trial  the duration of patient follow up required  the number of clinical sites at which the trial is conducted  competing trials and the length of time required to locate and enroll suitable patient subjects 
various statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing  safety  labeling  storage  record keeping and marketing of each product 
the lengthy process of seeking these approvals  and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our business 
in responding to an nda or a bla  the fda may grant marketing approval  request additional information or deny the application if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval 
there can be no assurance that any approval required by the fda or other regulatory body will be obtained on a timely basis  if at all 
for additional discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing development of potential products  see item a 
risk factors above 
included below is a summary of products and the related stage of development for each product in clinical development 
the information in the column labeled estimated completion of ongoing phase constitutes forward looking statements regarding timing of completion of product development phases 
our estimates of timing of completion of these trials are based on typical times of completion for trials of that type at such phases of development 
the actual timing of completion of these phases of our clinical trials could differ materially from the estimates provided in the table due to the number of patients enrolled in the trial  the number of clinical trial sites involved  the time needed to fully enroll the trial  the time required for patient follow up and other factors 
longer time frames for the completion of certain trials may be the result of requirements to measure patient survival 
in addition  it is possible that any of these ongoing clinical trials may never be completed due to the occurrence of unacceptable treatment related side effects  lack of clinical efficacy  insufficient supply of product for these clinical trials and other factors

risk factors above 
estimated phase of completion treatment development of phase gvax cancer immunotherapies prostate cancer phase pancreatic cancer phase leukemia phase oncolytic virus therapy cg recurrent bladder cancer phase general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in and million in the increase in compared to is primarily due to recording million in of non cash stock based compensation expense related to adoption of fas r 
the decrease in compared to

we received approximately million in proceeds after deducting the initial purchasers discount and estimated offering expenses  which we used  in part  to repay bank debt totaling million 
in march  we entered into a committed equity financing facility ceff with kingsbridge  pursuant to which kingsbridge committed to purchase  subject to certain conditions  up to million shares of our common stock or up to an aggregate of million during the next three years 
under the ceff  we are able to draw down in tranches of up to a maximum of percent of our closing market value on the last trading day prior to the commencement of the draw down  or million  whichever is less  subject to certain conditions 
the purchase price of these shares is discounted between to percent from the volume weighted average price of our common stock for each of the eight trading days following the election to sell shares 
kingsbridge is not obligated to purchase shares at prices below per share or at a price below of the closing share price of our stock in the trading day immediately preceding the commencement of the draw down

net cash used in operating activities was million in compared to million in and million in the decrease in compared to was primarily due to lower costs resulting from the strategic restructuring of our business operations and exit payments made in the increase in compared to was due primarily to a decline in revenues of million and the restructuring charge of million 
cash requirements for operating activities are expected to increase in future periods  due in part to significant costs related to our ongoing phase trials 
the timing of these cash requirements may vary from period to period depending on our research and development activities  including our planned preclinical and clinical trials

net cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to million in and million in cash flows in include net proceeds of million from the sale of million shares of our common stock to kingsbridge under our ceff and net proceeds of million from the sale of million shares of our common stock under an underwritten public offering 
cash flows in include net proceeds of million from the private placement of our convertible senior notes issuance in october and november and net proceeds of million in connection with our public offering of million shares of common stock in march in october  we used part of the proceeds from our convertible note issuance to repay loans of an aggregate of million to fleet bank and silicon valley bank 
in connection with a gain on sale of abgenix common stock in  we paid million in federal and state income taxes 
since we have received million in tax refunds from the carryback of losses 
we have additional unutilized federal and state net operating loss nol carryforwards  although the future utilization of our federal nol carryforwards is limited by internal revenue code section  which imposes an annual limitation on taxable income that can be offset by nol s following a change in control 
for irs purposes we experienced a change in control during our acquisition of somatix in our unutilized state net operating loss carryforwards may be similarly limited 
we lease certain of our facilities and equipment under non cancelable operating leases 
these leases  including the hayward and memphis facility leases  expire at various dates through  and some contain options for renewal 
our south san francisco headquarters facility lease is recorded as a capital lease as a result of certain amendments that required us to fund the costs of certain structural components of the facility 
in connection with the sale of our san diego  california manufacturing facility for viral products to genzyme corporation and the termination of the related facility leases in november  we retired approximately million of leasehold improvements and manufacturing assets and million of related accumulated depreciation 
also  in november  we terminated the lease for our former corporate headquarters facility in foster city  california and retired approximately million of associated leasehold improvements  equipment and related accumulated depreciation 
the hayward facility was placed in service during in  we moved our corporate headquarters to south san francisco from foster city  california 
as a result  we retired approximately million of leasehold improvements and other assets related to our former corporate headquarters in foster city  california and approximately million of related accumulated depreciation in 
table of contents our long term contractual obligations at december  were as follows in thousands payment due and total and and thereafter convertible senior notes and related interest south san francisco capital lease obligation operating leases under certain circumstances  we may redeem some or all of the convertible senior notes on or after november  at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes 
holders of the notes may require us to repurchase some or all of their notes if a fundamental change as defined in the indenture occurs  at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts  if any to  but not including  the repurchase date 
the notes are convertible into our common stock  initially at the conversion price of per share  equal to a conversion rate of approximately shares per  principal amount of notes  subject to adjustment 
we estimate that our cash to be used in operating activities during will be approximately million to million 
this estimated use of cash excludes the possible payment to settle our fiscal tax liability  capital expenditures  the cost of any potential acquisitions  nor does it reflect the potential offset by equity or debt financings or major new collaborative ventures or potential proceeds from the ceff 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including the progress and scope of our internally funded research  development  clinical  manufacturing and commercialization activities  our ability to establish new collaborations and the terms of those collaborations  our ability to reach a favorable resolution with the irs with respect to their audit of our fiscal federal tax return  or to other potential tax assessments  competing technological and market developments  the time and cost of regulatory approvals  and various other factors that we discuss under item a 
risk factors above 
our ongoing development programs and any increase in the number and size of programs and trials will reduce our current cash resources and potentially create further need to raise additional capital 
therefore  we will continue to consider financing alternatives  including collaborative ventures and potential equity and debt financings 
while we believe that our current liquidity position will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least the next year  we will need to raise substantial additional funds in order to complete our pending and planned trials over their multi year course before we will obtain product revenue  if any  from such products 
accordingly  we may entertain the possibility of raising additional capital to preserve our liquidity  depending on a number of conditions  including conditions in the capital markets 
the sources of liquidity available to us include payments from potential partners and or licensees of our potential products and technologies  and private or public placement of our equity securities  warrants  debt securities  potential proceeds from the ceff or depositary shares 
we regularly consider the conditions of capital markets  dilution  stockholder value and tax consequences of each type of financing on stockholders 
certain of the financing options available to us may have negative consequences to stockholders such as dilution 
given the volatile nature of the capital markets  decisions to raise capital may require actions that would impose a negative consequence in order to reduce or minimize a more significant negative consequence to stockholders
