item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations marketing marketing segment revenues  operating earnings and depreciation are as follows in thousands revenues operating earnings depreciation marketing segment revenues result from sales of crude oil  natural gas and refined products such as gasoline and diesel 
required reporting for certain sales transactions is on a gross revenue basis as title passes to the customer  while other transactions are reported on a net revenue basis ie the commodity acquisition cost is netted against gross sales value 
components of marketing segment revenues are as follows in thousands crude oil sales  net of proceeds from buy sell arrangements crude oil sales proceeds from buy sell arrangements natural gas sales refined product sales total marketing revenues prior to january   proceeds from transactions involving crude oil buy sell arrangements were reported on a gross revenue basis 
beginning in  such buy sell transactions are reported on a net revenue basis 
the table above shows comparative revenues 
this required accounting change for the presentation of revenue transactions has no impact on net earnings or reported earnings from operations 
crude oil sales  net of proceeds from buy sell arrangements  increased by percent to  for the revenue increase was due  in part to a percent increase in average crude oil prices as shown in the table below 
also contributing to the revenue increase was an increase in crude oil sale volumes at major trade locations in order to support the company s wellhead level crude oil purchasing business 
during  future month crude oil prices tended to exceed current or spot month sales 
in order to retain its supplier base  the company increasingly offered to purchase wellhead volumes based on future month s crude oil pricing scenarios 
this pricing strategy necessitated increasing crude oil sales volumes at trade locations in order to profitably respond to this marketing need 
natural gas transactions are presented on a net revenue or gross margin basis and margins for at  were consistent with results 
the refined product sales increase to  for the current period reflects higher commodity prices consistent with the trend for crude oil partially offset by reduced sales volumes as the company improved its operating earnings by reducing sales to marginal accounts

the components of marketing segment operating earnings loss are as follows in thousands crude oil natural gas refined products crude oil operating earnings are reduced in relative to for a combination of reasons 
first  during the company recognized as a reduction in operating expenses  due to the reversal of certain previously recorded accrual items following the final true up of the accounting for such items as well as a  expense reduction resulting from the cash collection of certain previously disputed and fully reserved items 
such items did not recur in second  during  crude oil prices rose from the per barrel range in december to the per barrel range in december producing a gain of approximately  during as the company liquidated relatively lower priced inventory into a higher priced market 
during  crude oil prices fluctuated with limited net impact or valuation during the year 
however  as of december   the company recognized a  lower of cost or market write down on the carrying value of its crude oil inventory as crude oil prices fell from the per barrel level at year end to an estimated market value at the per barrel level for year end valuation purposes 
as of december   the company held  barrels of crude oil inventory valued at per barrel 
the adverse items affecting as described above were partially offset by improved per unit sales margins within the crude oil segment for natural gas operating earnings declined to  in compared to  in because the marketplace in offered improved margins due to a tightening of supply 
results for benefited  however  due to increased volumes as shown in the table above 
refined products operating earnings improved to  in as the company enhanced its capability to deliver biodiesel to the marketplace during a period of strong demand for such product 
in comparing operating earnings to  the crude oil component benefited in from the  reversal of certain accrual items as discussed above 
the natural gas and refined products business improved in relative to due to product shortages which served to boost margins in transportation the transportation segment revenues and operating earnings were as follows in thousands amount change amount change amount change revenues operating earnings depreciation represents the percentage increase decrease from the prior year 
beginning in april  the company experienced increased demand for its petrochemical trucking services 
this demand surge continued for the remainder of and remained strong into the fourth quarter of the demand increase boosted comparative revenues by percent in and an additional percent in to  for the year 
although revenues increased in  operating earnings were reduced by percent to  this apparently contradictory result was caused by a shortage of available qualified drivers for company owned trucks 
the driver shortage caused the company to sub contract more of its business to truck owner operators  while company owned trucks remained idle 
thus  higher fixed costs such as depreciation were not being absorbed by higher revenues 
the increase in depreciation expense as shown above for resulted from new equipment additions over the course of the last three years in anticipation of expanded sales activity 
based on the current level of infrastructure  the company s transportation segment is designed to maximize efficiency when revenues are in the million per year range 
demand for the company s trucking service is closely tied to the domestic petrochemical industry and has generally remained strong with some weakness in recent months 
the company s business is spurred by a relatively strong united states and world economy coupled with a relatively weak exchange value for the us dollar 
other important factors include reduced levels of competition as the trucking industry has experienced a general shake out in recent years coupled with the competing railroad industry experiencing intermittent service delays 
an additional important factor is a general lack of available qualified drivers limiting the company s ability to expand in its market areas 
thus far in  due to reduced customer demand  the company s transportation business is operating somewhat below its target level for maximizing efficiency 
oil and gas oil and gas segment revenues and operating earnings are primarily derived from crude oil and natural gas production volumes prices 
comparative oil and gas segment revenues and operating earnings were as follows in thousands amount change amount change amount change revenues operating earnings depreciation and depletion represents the percentage increase decrease from the prior year 
oil and gas revenues improved during the three year period presented as a result of generally improving prices as well as increased production sales volumes from recent exploration efforts 
operating earnings generally improved consistent with revenues but were reduced in relative to as shown above  for  the company experienced an increased rate of depreciation and depletion due to a reduction in projected future oil and gas volumes as a result of reduced pricing for natural gas in the company s year end reserve estimate 
operating earnings for were also burdened by an impairment provision of  on certain producing properties where drilling costs incurred and capitalized exceeded the estimated fair value of the properties 
similar impairment provision for and totaled  and  respectively 
crude oil and natural gas production volumes and comparative prices were as follows production volumes crude oil  bbls  bbls  bbls natural gas  mcf  mcf  mcf average price crude oil bbl bbl bbl natural gas mcf mcf mcf an important item impacting operating earnings is the amount of exploration expenses incurred 
during  exploration expense totaled  compared to  for and  for such expenses included   and  respectively  of impairment provision on non producing properties as well as   and  of dry hole and geophysical costs for  and  respectively 
additionally  operating earnings benefited from a  gain from the sale of certain calcasieu parish  louisiana oil and gas producing properties 
during  the company participated in the drilling of thirty seven wells

as used for oil and gas reserve valuation purposes  natural gas prices at year end were compared to per mcf at year end the company s current drilling and exploration efforts are primarily focused as follows eaglewood project the eaglewood project area encompasses a ten county area from south texas along the gulf coast and into east texas 
in this area  the company purchased existing d seismic data and reprocessed it using proprietary techniques 
during  four wells were successfully drilled in the brushy creek area of this project with four additional wilcox test wells planned for calcasieu parish this area includes the sugar cane  louisiana five and ged prospect areas of louisiana 
to date  nine wells have been drilled with six successful and three dry holes 
in addition to a successful hackberry formation play  exploration has been expanded to include the deep yegua 
seismic evaluation continues with eight additional prospects identified for drilling in southern alabama during  three wells were spud in this area to test the smackover formation with one productive well and two dry holes 
seismic interpretation continues to determine smackover viability in this area 
one well is currently drilling in the area to test the norphlet formation with a second well planned for later in elm grove during  ten successful wells were drilled in the elm grove field in north louisiana 
this activity is in field development of the cotton valley formation and provides very low risk opportunities 
five additional wells are planned for drilling in james lime project beginning in  the company agreed to participate in this geological trend play of nacogdoches county  east texas 
this trend play covers over  acres extending into adjacent counties 
five marginally successful wells were drilled in this area during the company remains very optimistic about this area and refinements in exploitation technique continue with four additional wells planned for seismic surveys the company is currently participating in a number of other seismic surveys and interpretation efforts 
specific projects include a d seismic survey of the napoleonville salt dome and reprocessing of d seismic data covering the sorrento dome  both located in assumption parish  louisiana 
the company is also participating in the purchase and reprocessing of seismic data in several counties in south texas as well as liberty and montgomery counties of texas 
in the peripheral fault trend of southwestern arkansas  the company is participating in two d seismic surveys 
the first survey has been completed with interpretation currently in process and drilling planned for later in field work has also begun on the second survey 
united kingdom north sea previously  the company held exploration licenses in the united kingdom s north sea block b and block c 
over the last three years  the company expended approximately  on seismic evaluation of these two prospective areas 
evaluations of block c were completed without identifying a commercially viable prospect and hence the block was relinquished in january for block b  the company was unable to fully complete its evaluation and identification of a financing partner prior to expiration of the two year license period 
although the b block was relinquished in  the company continued its evaluation efforts and reapplied for licensing 
in february  the company together with its joint interest partners was awarded a promote license in blocks b  b  and d 
the company holds a percent equity interest in these blocks located in the central sector of the north sea 
the company has two years to confirm an exploration prospect and identify a partner to finance  on a promoted basis  the drilling of the first well on the block 
the terms of the license do not include a well commitment 
in connections with the acquisition of these blocks  the company also acquired an approximate nine percent equity interest in a promote licensing right to block b  located in the southern sector of the uk north sea 
general and administrative  interest income and income tax general and administrative expenses were elevated in relative to both and due to accounting compliance costs totaling  resulting from the use of consultants to assist in the implementation of accounting procedure documentation as required by the sarbanes oxley act of based on the company s current market capitalization  the company expects to be fully sarbanes oxley compliant as of december  and  of such costs were incurred in substantial additional costs will continue to be incurred in connection with the company s ongoing sarbanes oxley effort 
interest income is increased in due to larger cash balances available during the year for overnight investment coupled with interest earned on its insurance related cash deposits 
the provision for income taxes is based on federal and state tax rates and variations are consistent with taxable income in the respective accounting periods 
discontinued operations effective september   the company sold its ownership in its offshore gulf of mexico crude oil gathering pipeline 
the sale was completed to eliminate abandonment obligations and because the company was no longer purchasing crude oil in the affected region 
the pipeline was sold for  in cash  plus assignment of future abandonment obligations 
the company recognized a  pre tax gain from the sale 
the activities for this operation including the gain on sale are included with discontinued operations 
in october  certain oil and gas properties held by the company s chairman and chief executive officer achieved payout status 
this event caused the company to earn a pre tax gain of  for the value of certain residual interests held by the company in the properties 
this gain is non recurring and has been included in discontinued operations for see also note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
outlook hydrocarbon commodity prices have been in a period of high volatility but are generally holding strong 
given these conditions  marketing segment earnings are expected to remain consistent with while oil and gas segment earnings are expected to improve somewhat as additional production comes on line 
for the transportation segment  the united states economy appears to be slowing and availability of qualified drivers remains a concern 
given these conditions for transportation  management remains optimistic in its ability to maintain transportation earnings near the level 
the company has the following major objectives for maintain marketing operating earnings at the million level 
maintain transportation operating earnings at the million level 
increase oil and gas operating earnings to the million level and replace percent of production with current reserve additions 
liquidity and capital resources during  and net cash provided by operating activities totaled   and  respectively 
management generally balances the cash flow requirements of the company s investment activity with available cash generated from operations 
over time  cash utilized for property and equipment additions  tracks with earnings from continuing operations plus the non cash provision for depreciation  depletion and amortization 
presently  management intends to restrict investment decisions to available cash flow 
significant  if any  additions to debt are not anticipated 
a summary of this relationship follows in thousands years ended december  total earnings from continuing operations depreciation  depletion and amortization property and equipment additions debt repayment cash available used for other uses banking relationships the company s bank loan agreement with bank of america provides for two separate lines of credit with interest at the bank s prime rate minus of one percent 
the working capital loan provides for borrowings up to million based on percent of eligible accounts receivable and percent of eligible inventories 
available capacity under the line is calculated monthly and as of december  was established at million 
the oil and gas production loan provides for flexible borrowings subject to a borrowing base established semi annually by the bank 
the borrowing base was established at million as of december  with no amounts outstanding 
the line of credit loans are scheduled to expire on october   with the then present balance outstanding converting to a term loan payable in eight equal quarterly installments 
as of december   bank debt outstanding under the company s two revolving credit facilities totaled million and such debt was repaid in full on january  the bank of america loan agreement  among other things  places certain restrictions with respect to additional borrowings and the purchase or sale of assets  as well as requiring the company to comply with certain financial covenants  including maintaining a to ratio of consolidated current assets to consolidated current liabilities  maintaining a to ratio of pre tax net income to interest expense  and consolidated net worth in excess of  should the company s net worth fall below this threshold  the company may be restricted from payment of additional cash dividends on its common stock 
the company was in compliance with these covenants at december the company s gulfmark subsidiary maintains a separate banking relationship with bnp paribas in order to support its crude oil purchasing activities 
in addition to providing up to million in letters of credit  the facility also finances up to million of crude oil inventory and certain accounts receivable associated with crude oil sales 
such financing is provided on a demand note basis with interest at the bank s prime rate plus one percent 
as of december   the company had million of eligible borrowing capacity under this facility and no working capital advances were outstanding 
letters of credit outstanding under this facility totaled approximately million as of december  the letter of credit and demand note facilities are secured by substantially all of gulfmark s and arm s assets 
under this facility  bnp paribas has the right to discontinue the issuance of letters of credit without prior notification to the company 
the company s arm subsidiary also maintains a separate banking relationship with bnp paribas in order to support its natural gas purchasing activities 
in addition to providing up to million in letters of credit  the facility finances up to million of general working capital needs 
such financing is provided on a demand note basis with interest at the bank s prime rate plus one percent 
no working capital advances were outstanding under this facility as of december  letters of credit outstanding under this facility totaled approximately million as of december  the letter of credit and demand note facilities are secured by substantially all of gulfmark s and arm s assets 
under this facility  bnp paribas has the right to discontinue the issuance of letters of credit without prior notification to the company 
off balance sheet arrangements the company maintains certain operating lease arrangements to provide tractor and trailer equipment for the company s truck fleet 
all such operating lease commitments qualify for off balance sheet treatment as provided by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases 
the company has operating lease arrangements for tractors  trailers  office space  and other equipment and facilities 
rental expense for the years ended december    and was   and  respectively 
at december   commitments under long term non cancelable operating leases for the next five years and thereafter are payable as follows   and thereafter  contractual cash obligations in addition to its banking relationships and obligations  the company enters into certain operating leasing arrangements for tractors  trailers  office space and other equipment and facilities 
the company has no capital lease obligations 
a summary of the payment periods for contractual debt and lease obligations is as follows in thousands thereafter total long term debt interest rate payments operating leases total on january   the company fully repaid the outstanding balance on its working capital loan 
as a result  no amounts of interest are shown for future periods 
in addition to its bank debt and lease financing obligations  the company is also committed to purchase certain quantities of crude oil and natural gas in connection with its marketing activities 
such commodity purchase obligations are the basis for commodity sales  which generate the cash flow necessary to meet such purchase obligations 
approximate commodity purchase obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands january remaining thereafter total crude oil natural gas investment activities during  the company invested approximately  for oil and gas projects  of which  was capitalized as additional property with  expensed as exploration costs 
an additional  and  was expended during for equipment additions for the marketing and transportation businesses  respectively 
oil and gas exploration and development efforts continue  and the company plans to invest approximately million toward such projects in  including million of seismic costs to be expensed during the year 
an additional approximate million is projected in for equipment additions and replacements within the company s marketing and transportation businesses 
insurance from time to time  the marketplace for all forms of insurance enters into periods of severe cost increases 
in the past  during such cyclical periods  the company has seen costs escalate to the point where desired levels of insurance were either unavailable or unaffordable 
the company s primary insurance needs are in the areas of worker s compensation  automobile and umbrella coverage for its trucking fleet and medical insurance for employees 
during and  insurance cost stabilized and totaled million and million  respectively 
overall insurance cost may experience renewed rate increases during since the company is generally unable to pass on such cost increases  any increase will need to be absorbed by existing operations 
competition in all phases of its operations  the company encounters strong competition from a number of entities 
many of these competitors possess financial resources substantially in excess of those of the company 
the company faces competition principally in establishing trade credit  pricing of available materials and quality of service 
in its oil and gas operation  the company also competes for the acquisition of mineral properties 
the company s marketing division competes with major oil companies and other large industrial concerns that own or control significant refining and marketing facilities 
these major oil companies may offer their products to others on more favorable terms than those available to the company 
from time to time in recent years  there have been supply imbalances for crude oil and natural gas in the marketplace 
this in turn has led to significant fluctuations in prices for crude oil and natural gas 
as a result  there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding both the future market price for crude oil and natural gas and the available margin spread between wholesale acquisition costs and sales realization 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates fair value accounting as an integral part of its marketing operation  the company enters into certain forward commodity contracts that are required to be recorded at fair value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and related accounting pronouncements 
management believes this required accounting  known as mark to market accounting  creates variations in reported earnings and the reported earnings trend 
under mark to market accounting  significant levels of earnings are recognized in the period of contract initiation rather than the period when the service is provided and title passes from supplier to customer 
as it affects the company s operation  management believes mark to market accounting impacts reported earnings and the presentation of financial condition in three important ways 
gross margins  derived from certain aspects of the company s ongoing business  are front ended into the period in which contracts are executed 
meanwhile  personnel and other costs associated with servicing accounts as well as substantially all risks associated with the execution of contracts are incurred during the period of physical product flow and title passage 
mark to market earnings are calculated based on stated contract volumes 
a significant risk associated with the company s business is the conversion of stated contract or planned volumes into actual physical commodity movement volumes without a loss of margin 
again  any planned profit from such commodity contracts is bunched and front ended into one period while the risk of loss associated with the difference between actual versus planned production or usage volumes falls in a subsequent period 
cash flows  by their nature  match physical movements and passage of title 
mark to market accounting  on the other hand  creates a mismatch between reported earnings and cash flows 
this complicates and confuses the picture of stated financial conditions and liquidity 
the company attempts to mitigate the identified risks by only entering into contracts where current market quotes in actively traded  liquid markets are available to determine the fair value of contracts 
in addition  substantially all of the company s forward contracts are less than months in duration 
however  the reader is cautioned to develop a full understanding of how fair value or mark to market accounting creates reported results that differ from those presented under conventional accrual accounting 
trade accounts accounts receivable and accounts payable typically represent the most significant assets and liabilities of the company 
particularly within the company s energy marketing  oil and gas exploration  and production operations  there is a high degree of interdependence with and reliance upon third parties  including transaction counterparties to provide adequate information for the proper recording of amounts receivable or payable 
substantially all such third parties are larger firms providing the company with the source documents for recording trade activity 
it is commonplace for these entities to retroactively adjust or correct such documents 
this typically requires the company to either absorb  benefit from  or pass along such corrections to another third party 
due to the volume of and complexity of transactions and the high degree of interdependence with third parties  this is a difficult area to control and manage 
the company manages this process by participating in a monthly settlement process with each of its counterparties 
ongoing account balances are monitored monthly and the company attempts to gain the cooperation of such counterparties to reconcile outstanding balances 
the company also places great emphasis on collecting cash balances due and paying only bonafide and properly supported claims 
in addition  the company maintains and monitors its bad debt allowance 
nevertheless a degree of risk remains  however  due to the custom and practices of the industry 
oil and gas reserve estimate the value of capitalized cost of oil and gas exploration and production related assets are dependent on underlying oil and gas reserve estimates 
reserve estimates are based on many subjective factors 
the accuracy of reserve estimates depends on the quantity and quality of geological data  production performance data and reservoir engineering data  changing prices  as well as the skill and judgment of petroleum engineers in interpreting such data 
the process of estimating reserves requires frequent revision of estimates usually on an annual basis as additional information becomes available 
calculations of estimated future oil and gas revenues are also based on estimates of the timing of oil and gas production  and there are no assurances that the actual timing of production will conform to or approximate such estimates 
also  certain assumptions must be made with respect to pricing 
the company s estimates assume prices will remain constant from the date of the engineer s estimates  except for changes reflected under natural gas sales contracts 
there can be no assurance that actual future prices will not vary as industry conditions  governmental regulation  political conditions  economic conditions  weather conditions  market uncertainty and other factors impact the market price for oil and gas 
the company follows the successful efforts method of accounting  so only costs including development dry hole costs associated with producing oil and gas wells are capitalized 
estimated oil and gas reserve quantities are the basis for the rate of amortization under the company s units of production method for depreciating  depleting and amortizing of oil and gas properties 
estimated oil and gas reserve values also provide the standard for the company s periodic review of oil and gas properties for impairment 
contingencies from time to time as incident to its operations  the company becomes involved in various accidents  lawsuits and or disputes 
primarily as an operator of an extensive trucking fleet  the company is a party to motor vehicle accidents  worker compensation claims or other items of general liability as are typical for the industry 
in addition  the company has extensive operations that must comply with a wide variety of tax laws  environmental laws and labor laws  among others 
should an incident occur  management evaluates the claim based on its nature  the facts and circumstances and the applicability of insurance coverage 
to the extent management believes that such event may impact the financial condition of the company  management will estimate the monetary value of the claim and make appropriate accruals or disclosure as provided in the guidelines of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies 
revenue recognition the company s crude oil  natural gas and refined products marketing customers are invoiced based on contractually agreed upon terms on an at least monthly basis 
revenue is recognized in the month in which the physical product is delivered to the customer 
where required  the company also recognizes fair value or mark to market gains and losses related to its commodity activities 
a detailed discussion of the company s risk management activities is included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
transportation segment customers are invoiced  and the related revenue is recognized as the service is provided 
oil and gas revenue from the company s interests in producing wells is recognized as title and physical possession of the oil and gas passes to the purchaser

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk includes potential adverse changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
interest rate risk total long term debt at december  included million of floating rate debt 
as a result  the company s annual interest costs fluctuate based on interest rate changes 
because the interest rate on the company s long term debt is a floating rate  the fair value approximates carrying value as of december  a hypothetical percent adverse change in the floating rate would not have had a material effect on the company s results of operations for the fiscal year ended december  commodity price risk the company s major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its marketing and production of crude oil and natural gas 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing spot prices applicable to oil and gas 
commodity price risk in the company s marketing operations represents the potential loss that may result from a change in the market value of an asset or a commitment 
from time to time  the company enters into forward contracts to minimize or hedge the impact of market fluctuations on its purchases of crude oil and natural gas 
the company may also enter into price support contracts with certain customers to secure a floor price on the purchase of certain supply 
in each instance  the company locks in a separate matching price support contract with a third party in order to minimize the risk of these financial instruments 
substantially all forward contracts fall within a six month to one year term with no contracts extending longer than three years in duration 
the company monitors all commitments and positions and endeavors to maintain a balanced portfolio 
certain forward contracts are recorded at fair value  depending on management s assessments of numerous accounting standards and positions that comply with generally accepted accounting principles 
the fair value of such contracts is reflected on the company s balance sheet as risk management assets and liabilities 
the undiscounted revaluation of such contracts is recognized on a net basis in the company s results of operations 
current market price quotes from actively traded liquid markets are used in all cases to determine the contracts fair value 
regarding net risk management assets  all of the presented values as of december  and were based on readily available market quotations 
risk management assets and liabilities are classified as short term or long term depending on contract terms 
the estimated future net cash inflow based on year end market prices is  with substantially all to be received in the estimated future cash inflow approximates the net fair value recorded in the company s risk management assets and liabilities 
the following table illustrates the factors impacting the change in the net value of the company s risk management assets and liabilities for the year ended december  in thousands 
net fair value on january  activity during cash received from settled contracts net realized gain from prior years contracts net unrealized gain from current year contracts net fair value on december  historically  prices received for oil and gas production have been volatile and unpredictable 
price volatility is expected to continue 
from january  through december  natural gas price realizations ranged from a monthly low of mmbtu to a monthly high of per mmbtu 
oil prices ranged from a low of per barrel to a high of per barrel during the same period 
a hypothetical percent adverse change in average natural gas and crude oil prices  assuming no changes in volume levels  would have reduced earnings by approximately  and  respectively  for the comparative years ended december  and
