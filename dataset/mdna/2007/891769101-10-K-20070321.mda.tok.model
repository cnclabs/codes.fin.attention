critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note summary of significant accounting policies to the audited consolidated financial statements included in this report 
allowance for loan losses 
our allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
additions to the allowance may result from recording provision for loan losses and recoveries  while charge offs are deducted from the allowance 
allocation of the allowance is made for analytical purposes only  and the entire allowance is available to absorb any loan charged off 
we have an established process for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses that relies on various procedures and pieces of information to arrive at a range of probable outcomes 
no single statistic or measurement  in itself  determines the adequacy of the allowance 
the allowance has two components identified specific allocations and a percentage allocation based on loss history for different loan groups 
to determine the allocated component of the allowance  we combine estimated allowances required for specifically identified loans that are analyzed individually and loans that are analyzed on a group basis 
first  management allocates specific portions of the allowance for loan losses based on identifiable problem loans 
problem loans are identified through a loan risk rating system and monitored through watchlist reporting 
specific allocations of allowance for loan losses are determined for each identified credit based on delinquency rates  collateral and other risk factors identified for that credit 
second  management s evaluation of the allowance for different loan groups is based on consideration of actual loss experience  the present and prospective financial condition of borrowers  industry concentrations within the loan portfolio and general economic conditions  and absent the availability of some of those factors  based upon peer industry data of comparable banks 
lastly  the unallocated component of the allowance is maintained to supplement the allocated component and to recognize the imprecision of estimating and measuring loss when evaluating loss allocations for individual loans or pools of loans 
the allocated and the unallocated components represent the total allowance for loan losses that would adequately cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the determination of the level of allowance and  correspondingly  the provision for loan losses  rests upon estimates and assumptions  including past loan loss experience  the nature and volume of the portfolio  information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values  economic conditions and other factors 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan is confirmed 
a loan is impaired when full payment under the loan terms is not expected 
impairment is evaluated in the aggregate for smaller balance loans of a similar nature such as residential mortgage and consumer loans  and on an individual loan basis for other loans 
commercial loans and mortgage loans secured by other properties are evaluated individually for impairment 
when analysis of a borrower s operating results and financial condition indicates that underlying cash flows of the borrower s business are not adequate to meet its debt service requirements  the loan is evaluated for impairment 
if a loan is impaired  a portion of the allowance is allocated so that the loan is reported  net  at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s existing interest rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
there are many factors affecting the allowance for loan losses  some are quantitative while others require qualitative judgment 
although management believes its process for determining the allowance adequately considers all of the potential factors that could potentially result in credit losses  the process includes subjective elements and may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provision for loan losses could be required that could adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods 
results of operations summary 
we reported net income of  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  this reflects an increase in net income from  in and net income of  posted during net income per diluted share of reflects a increase from the reported in and a increase from the posted in the results reflected a growth in net income compared to strong revenue growth  including net interest and non interest income  of  or  due to loan volume growth along with increases in interest rates  was offset by an increase in operating expenses of  or  as a result of infrastructure expansion  personnel reorganization  formation of a de novo bank in indianapolis  and the formation of two investment subsidiaries 
net interest income in was  compared to  in  an increase of  due mainly from an increase in loans outstanding and the increase in interest rates 
noninterest income in was  compared to  in  an increase of the increase was due primarily to a  or  increase in fees earned on trust and brokerage assets under management 
net interest income 
net interest income  the difference between revenue generated from earning assets and the interest cost of funding those assets  is our primary source of earnings 
interest income and interest expense for the year ended december  were  and  respectively  netting  in net interest income 
interest income and interest expense for the year ended december  were  and  respectively  resulting in  in net interest income 
interest income and interest expense for the year ended december  totaled  and  respectively  providing for net interest income of  the substantial increase of  in net interest income in from and the increase over net interest income from were primarily attributable to an increase in the loans outstanding in both years  as well as an increase in the prime lending rate during   and the net yield on average earning assets during was compared to for and for the decrease in margin during was attributable to net interest spread compression caused by the increase in general interest rates and its effects on the company s variable rate deposits  along with the company neutralizing its balance sheet with additional fixed rate loans 
management anticipates that margins will stabilize due to the company s current neutral balance sheet  assuming interest rates decrease 
the level of net interest income is primarily a function of asset size  as the weighted average interest rate received on earning assets is greater than the weighted average interest cost of funding sources  however  factors such as types of assets and liabilities  interest rate risk  liquidity  and customer behavior also impact net interest income as well as the net yield

driven by net charge offs  growth of the loan portfolio  and the portfolio composition and risk  the provision for loan losses was  for   for and  for this reflects a  or  decrease from to the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans outstanding was  and at december    and  respectively 
the decrease in the allowance for loan loss as a percentage of total loans between and was a result of the timing at which we recorded charge offs 
historically  we have set a specific allowance for the estimated unrealizable value of the loan and recorded the charge off upon final resolution of the problem loan 
in  in an effort to apply current accounting and regulatory standards in a manner that is more consistent with our industry and peers  we began recording charge offs at the time the expected net realizable value was less than the gross carrying value  rather than carrying these notes at gross with a specific reserve allocated against it 
we maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level management feels is adequate to absorb probable losses incurred in the loan portfolio 
the evaluation is based upon our historical loan loss experience  along with the banking industry s historical loan loss experience  as well as known and inherent risks contained in the loan portfolio  composition and growth of the loan portfolio  current and projected economic conditions and other factors 
we had  of nonperforming loans at december   an increase of  from the  of nonperforming loans at december  nonperforming loans were  at december  we reported of net charge offs  or of average loans during compared to  in net charge offs or of average loans during and  in net charge offs during loan growth during was  nearly double the growth achieved in noninterest income 
total noninterest income was  for the year ended december  compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
fees from trust and brokerage services grew resulting from an increasing base of accounts and assets under management  and was  for compared to  for and  in mortgage broker fees were during  a decrease of or from for mortgage broker fees were for the decrease in was attributable to a conscious effort by the company to retain more loans in its own portfolio versus brokering for a third party 
total mortgage loan origination volume of approximately  was higher than and deposit service charges were in  showing a decrease of or from deposit service charges increased or between and in november  the bank received a reimbursement from its insurance carrier against losses recorded for the unauthorized mortgage issue detected in the reimbursement received was for  however the bank incurred expenses and losses against this claim of and  in and respectively 
other fee income increased mainly as a result of income generated from bank owned life insurance boli and ach wire fees 
in addition to the above  noninterest income results included no gains or losses on the sale of securities available for sale compared to a loss on the sale of securities of in and a gain on the sale of securities and loans of during noninterest expense 
noninterest expense totaled  for the year ended december  compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of  or during over the increase in expenses is mainly attributable to the infrastructure growth of the bank  personnel reorganization  the formation of a de novo bank in indianapolis  and the formation of two investment subsidiaries 
salary and benefit costs increased  or and were of total noninterest expenses 
this increase was reflective of the addition of new full time equivalent employees during seven of the new employee s related to the addition of our sixth banking office in fort wayne  the opening of a loan production office in warsaw  and the conversion of our angola loan production office into a full service banking center 
overall  operating expenses increased by  related to these office expansions 
during the fourth quarter of  the president of the bank resigned 
the payout on his employment contract had a net impact of on salary expense in we also incurred of expense related to the formation of a de novo bank in indianapolis and the hiring of its current four person staff in our indianapolis loan production office 
we are anticipating regulatory approval of the new institution in early  with a spring opening projected 
lastly  we adopted fas r on january   which required us to begin expensing the value of unvested stock options 
the stock option expense for was occupancy and equipment costs increased  or  and were  or of total expenses 
occupancy and equipment costs increased as a direct result of the infrastructure growth described above 
loan and professional costs increased during from prior year levels by or 
the increase was attributable primarily to of costs associated with the implementation of tower capital investments  inc and tower funding corp 
tower capital investments  inc  is a wholly owned subsidiary of the bank  while tower funding corp is a wholly owned subsidiary of tower capital investments 
tower funding corp is a real estate investment trust reit that was established to hold real estate mortgage loans  the income from which gives tower bank an alternative source for raising capital in the future if the need arises 
data processing expenses increased by  or  primarily due to our increase infrastructure  which causes the need for greater storage capacity with our data warehousing supplier 
other  various expense categories increased during  such as marketing  office supplies and postage  and courier services  but to a lesser dollar amount than those mentioned above 
other expense was  for  for and for  which reflected a  or increase in and  or increase from  as compared to the prior year 
during  salaries and benefits costs were  while occupancy and equipment expenses totaled  additional large overhead expenses in included costs for professional fees and services  which amounted to  and marketing expenses of significant noninterest expenses during were  for salary and benefit costs   for occupancy and equipment costs  and  for loan and professional costs 
monitoring and controlling overhead expenses while providing high quality service to customers is of the utmost importance to us 
the efficiency ratio  computed by dividing noninterest expense by net interest income plus noninterest income  was in compared to in and in the overall level of efficiency ratio continues to be high  but reflects expected infrastructure costs associated with growth as well as certain non recurring costs discussed above 
as anticipated  improvement in the efficiency ratio is dependent upon the growth in earning assets along with the development of fee based products and the resulting increases in revenue 
management expects that as additional asset growth and operating efficiencies are realized  the company will earn more on the larger base of earning assets while operating costs will increase at a lesser rate  resulting in an improved efficiency ratio 
income taxes expense 
during  and  we recorded   and  respectively  in income taxes expense 
the effective tax rate recorded for was as compared to for and for the reduction in the effective tax rate in was primarily due to additional tax exempt investment income and the formation of an investment subsidiary structure including the establishment of a real estate investment trust 
the ownership structure of this real estate investment trust provides us with an alternative vehicle for raising capital should we so desire  as well as  providing us with certain state income tax benefits  which will lower our effective state tax rate for the year and future 
the reduction of the effective tax rate in and was primarily due to us increasing our tax exempt security portfolio and the purchase of additional bank owned life insurance boli during capital sources stockholders equity is a noninterest bearing source of funds  which provides support for asset growth 
stockholders equity was  and  at december  and  respectively 
affecting the increase in stockholders equity during was net income of  from the net exercise of stock options  from stock option compensation expense per fasb r  and from dividends to shareholders 
stockholders equity increased during from net income of  and from in the net exercise of stock options 
the company and the bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies 
failure to meet the various capital requirements can initiate regulatory action that could have a direct material effect on the financial statements 
currently  both the company and the bank have been categorized as well capitalized  the highest classification contained within the banking regulations 
the capital ratios of the company and the bank as of december  and are disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our ability to pay cash and stock dividends is subject to limitations under various laws and regulations and to prudent and sound banking practices 
prior to no cash or stock dividends were paid 
in december  our board of directors formally approved the payment of dividends commencing in calendar this was based on an analysis of our liquidity needs  regulatory and capital requirements  and results of operations 
during  we paid dividends of per share in four quarterly installments 
in january  our board of directors voted to increase the quarterly dividend payment by to per share commencing with the first quarter dividend payment 
liquidity and capital ratios december loan to deposit ratio loan to funding ratio total risk based capital tier risk based capital tier leverage capital liquidity liquidity is measured by our ability to raise funds through deposits  borrowed funds  capital or cash flow from the repayment of loans and investment securities 
these funds are used to meet depositor withdrawals  maintain reserve requirements  to fund loans and to fund operational expenses 
liquidity is primarily achieved through the growth of deposits and liquid assets such as securities available for sale  matured securities  and federal funds sold 
asset and liability management is the process of managing the balance sheet to achieve a mix of earning assets and liabilities that maximize profitability  while providing adequate liquidity 
our liquidity strategy is to fund growth with deposits from both in market and out of market sources  federal home loan bank borrowings and to maintain an adequate level of short term and medium term investments to meet typical daily loan and deposit activity needs 
deposit growth was substantial during and we mainly generated deposits from in market sources  however  we expanded our funding base during to include national  non brokered certificates of deposit  borrowings from the fhlb and trust preferred securities 
during we further expanded our funding base to include brokered deposits 
at december   the balance of non brokered national market cds  brokered cds  and fhlb borrowings were   and  respectively  as compared to   and  respectively  at december  we expect to continue to experience loan growth 
funding for the loan growth will continue to come from in market sources through the marketing of products and the development of branch locations 
we will also continue to develop wholesale and out of market deposits and borrowing capacities and use them to augment its interest rate sensitivity strategy and liquidity capabilities and to diversify the funding base of the bank 
we have the ability to borrow money on a daily basis through correspondent banks federal funds purchased  and had no borrowings at december  and additional capacity to borrow overnight in the form of unused lines of commitment from correspondent banks totaled  at december  and december  we view this type of funding as only a secondary and temporary source of funds 
contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet risk in addition to normal loan funding and deposit flow  we also need to maintain liquidity to meet the demands of certain unfunded loan commitments and standby and commercial letters of credit 
the bank maintains off balance sheet financial instruments in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
loan commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer at any time  as the customer s needs vary  as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
we monitor fluctuations in loan balances and commitment levels and include such data in our overall liquidity management 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized  if any  in the balance sheet 
the bank s maximum exposure to loan loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the face amount of these instruments 
commitments to extend credit are recorded when they are funded and standby letters of credit are recorded at fair value 
the bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
collateral  such as accounts receivable  securities  inventory  property and equipment is generally required based on management s credit assessment of the borrower 
tower financial corporation  the bank  and the trust company occupy their respective headquarters  offices and other facilities under long term operating leases and  in addition  are parties to long term contracts for data processing and operating systems

tippmann abstaining 
our composite rental rate and terms are market competitive  and under our statement of policy for the review  approval  or ratification of transactions with related persons  our audit committee has reviewed and ratified all terms of the lease  as amended and have found that the terms are fair and reasonable and in the best interest of our company and shareholders 
the total amount paid to tippmann properties for rent and maintenance was  and during  and  respectively 
the lease is accounted for as an operating lease 
refer to the contractual obligations table above for a summary of future lease payment commitments under this and other leases 
financial condition we again experienced significant growth during total assets were  at december  compared to  at december   an increase of  or 
the significant increase in assets was mainly attributable to growth in the loan portfolio and was funded by a significant growth in deposits and the use of short term investments 
asset growth has been substantial during each year since we began operations 
management anticipates that  in the near term  assets will increase at a rate similar to our historical trends as management continues to market our products  banking expertise and trust services  deliver a high level of customer service and develop its branch network 
earning assets 
the bank s loan portfolio experienced another year of significant growth during loans were  at december  compared to  at december   an increase of  or 
the loan portfolio  which equaled and of earning assets at december  and  respectively  was primarily comprised of commercial and commercial real estate loans at both dates 
at december   commercial and commercial real estate loans were approximately of the loan portfolio and represented loans to business interests generally located within the bank s market area 
approximately of the loan portfolio at december  consisted of general commercial and industrial loans primarily secured by inventory  receivables  and equipment  while of the loan portfolio consisted of commercial loans primarily secured by real estate 
the largest concentrations of credit within the commercial and commercial real estate category are represented by owner occupied and investment real estate at  or of total loans  and building  development and general contracting at  or of total loans 
the concentration and growth in commercial credits is in keeping with the bank s strategy of focusing a substantial amount of efforts on commercial banking 
business banking is an area of expertise for the bank s management and lending team 
residential mortgage and home equity lending  while only of loans at december   also experienced significant growth 
consumer loans  while only of total loans at december   reflected an increase of during from levels 
management believes that loan growth should continue as the bank expands its distribution network during  however  our main strategy for growth and profitability is expected to come largely from the commercial loan sector

these guidelines include loan review and early identification of problem loans to provide effective loan portfolio administration 
the credit policies and procedures are meant to minimize the risk and uncertainties inherent in lending 
in following these policies and procedures  the bank must rely on estimates  appraisals and evaluation of loans and the possibility that changes could occur because of changing economic conditions 
identified problem loans  which exhibit characteristics financial or otherwise that could cause the loans to become nonperforming or require restructuring in the future  are included on an internal watchlist 
senior management reviews this list regularly and adjusts for changing conditions 
at december   there were  of potential problem loans outstanding on the watchlist

in each quarter  the allowance for loan losses is adjusted by management to the amount management believes is necessary to maintain the allowance at adequate levels 
management allocates specific portions of the allowance for loan losses to specifically identified problem loans 
management s evaluation of the allowance is further based on consideration of actual loss experience  the present and prospective financial condition of borrowers  industry concentrations within the portfolio and general economic conditions 
management believes that the present allowance is adequate  based on the broad range of considerations listed above  and further  based upon peer industry data of comparable banks

the primary risk element considered by management with respect to each installment and residential real estate loan is lack of timely payment 
management has a reporting system that monitors past due loans and has adopted policies to pursue its creditors rights in order to preserve the bank s position 
the primary risk elements with respect to commercial loans are the financial condition of the borrower  the sufficiency of collateral  and lack of timely payment 
management has a policy of requesting and reviewing periodic financial statements from its commercial loan customers  and periodically reviews the sufficiency of collateral and its value 
although management considers the allowance for loan losses to be adequate to absorb losses that are incurred  there can be no assurance that charge offs in future periods will not exceed the allowance 
additionally  banking regulators can require an increase to the allowance for loan losses if they deem necessary to satisfy regulatory safety and soundness concerns 
we experienced  of charge offs and of recoveries during we experienced  of charge offs and of recoveries during   of charge offs and of recoveries during  and  of charge offs and of recoveries during prior to  we only experienced an aggregate amount of in loan charge offs during its first four years of operations

during both and  we again expanded the size and length of maturity of the portfolio as we continued to develop a more diversified portfolio

source of funds our major source of funds is from core deposits of local businesses  governmental and municipal public fund entities  and consumers within the market area 
we also generate certificates of deposit through national out of market sources outside allen and surrounding counties developed during and the out of market deposits are generated through negotiated transaction with brokers 
total deposits were  at december  and  at december   an increase of  or 
noninterest bearing deposits totaled  at december   a increase from  at december  at december   noninterest bearing deposits were approximately of total deposits  a decrease from the level of 
noninterest bearing deposits at december  were comprised of  in business checking accounts  in public funds and  in consumer accounts 
interest bearing deposits grew during and were  at december   a increase over  at december  interest bearing deposits at december  were comprised of approximately in money market accounts  in interest bearing checking and savings accounts  and in certificates of deposit 
the december  percentages reflect a modest change in the deposit mix from  when the percentages were   and  respectively 
with the exception of savings accounts  all deposit categories increased in the largest increase was in the money market category  as money market deposits increased by  or 
the large increase is primarily due to the addition of our new reserve product during the early second quarter of the reserve is a sweep product that allowed us to handle the swept accounts in house versus sending the deposits to another institution 
this allowed us to maintain these balances on our balance sheet 
as of december   the balance in the reserve account was  savings accounts decreased by  or 
however this is offset by a   increase in interest bearing checking accounts 
the change is reflective of the rising interest rate environment and the flexibility of the interest bearing checking accounts versus the standard savings account 
certificate of deposits under increased by  or  while certificates of deposit over increase by  or 
the increases in certificates of deposit were again reflective of the rising interest rate environment 
 of the growth in cds over came from within the bank s market area  while the remainder was from the purchase of brokered cds 
we had no short term borrowings at december  or december  in addition to federal funds purchased  we also had borrowings in the amount of  in federal home loan bank fhlb bullet advances at december  compared to  at december  the decrease in fhlb borrowings during was the result of significant deposit growth  as well as the use of excess short term investments to fund asset growth 
during  we made a conscious effort to keep our liquidity lower by utilizing these excess short term investments 
we had  and  aggregate principal amount in junior subordinated debenture outstanding at december  and  respectively 
we have three statutory trust subsidiaries 
tct effected a private placement of  in trust preferred securities on november   which was paid off in november tct effected a private placement of  in trust preferred securities on december  tct effected a private placement of  on december  the proceeds were loaned to us in exchange for junior subordinated debentures with similar terms to the trust preferred securities 
these securities are considered tier i capital with certain limitations applicable under current regulatory guidelines 
the junior subordinated debentures are subject to mandatory redemption  in whole or in part  upon repayment of the trust preferred securities at maturity or their earlier redemption at the par amount 
the maturity date of the trust preferred securities issued by tct is november  subject to our having received prior approval of the federal reserve bank  if then required  the trust preferred securities were redeemable prior to the maturity date beginning november  and each year thereafter at our option 
we redeemed these securities on november  the maturity date of the trust preferred securities issued by tct is december  subject to our having received prior approval of the federal reserve bank  if then required  the trust preferred securities are redeemable prior to the maturity date beginning december  and each year thereafter at our option 
the maturity date of the trust preferred securities issued by tct is december  subject to our having received prior approval of the federal reserve bank  if then required  the trust preferred securities are redeemable prior to the maturity date beginning december  and each year thereafter at our option

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk analysis our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk and  to a lesser extent  liquidity risk 
all of the company s transactions are denominated in us dollars with no specific foreign exchange exposure 
the company has no agricultural related loan assets and therefore has no significant exposure to changes in commodity prices 
any impact that changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices would have on interest rates is assumed to be insignificant 
interest rate risk is the exposure of our financial condition to adverse movements in interest rates 
we derive our income primarily from the excess of interest collected on our interest earning assets over the interest paid on our interest bearing liabilities 
the rates of interest we earn on our assets and owe on our liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time 
since market interest rates change over time  we are exposed to lower profitability if we cannot adapt to interest rate changes 
accepting interest rate risk can be an important source of profitability and stockholder value  however  excessive levels of interest rate risk could pose a significant threat to our earnings and capital base 
accordingly  effective risk management that maintains interest rate risk at prudent levels is essential to our safety and soundness 
evaluating the exposure to changes in interest rates includes assessing both the adequacy of the process used to control interest rate risk and the quantitative level of exposure 
our interest rate risk management process seeks to ensure that appropriate policies  procedures  management information and internal controls are in place to maintain interest rate risk at prudent levels with consistency and continuity 
in evaluating the quantitative level of interest rate risk  we assess the existing and potential future effects of changes in interest rates on our financial condition  including capital adequacy  earnings  liquidity and overall asset quality 
there are two interest rate risk measurement techniques that we may use 
the first  which is commonly referred to as gap analysis  measures the difference between the dollar amount of interest sensitive assets and liabilities that will be refinanced or repriced during a given time period 
a significant repricing gap could result in a negative impact to our net interest margin during periods of changing market interest rates 
the following table describes our position as of december  rate sensitivity analysis in thousands within three months three to twelve months one to five years after five years total assets federal funds sold  short term investments and interest earning deposits securities available for sale fhlbi and frb stock fixed rate loans variable rate loans allowance for loan losses other assets total assets liabilities interest bearing checking savings accounts money market accounts time deposits  time deposits  and over short term borrowings fhlb advances junior subordinated debt noninterest bearing checking other liabilities total liabilities stockholders equity total sources of funds net asset liability gap cumulative gap percent of cumulative gap to total assets a second interest rate risk measurement used is commonly referred to as net interest income simulation analysis 
a simulation model assesses the direction and magnitude of variations in net interest income resulting from potential changes in market interest rates 
key assumptions in the model include prepayment speeds on various loan and investment assets  cash flows and maturities of interest sensitive assets and liabilities  and changes in market conditions impacting loan and deposit volume and pricing 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain  subject to fluctuation and revision in a dynamic environment  therefore  a model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or exactly predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and our strategies  among other factors 
as growth has dictated  we began utilizing simulation analysis as a tool for measuring the effects of interest rate risk on the income statement at the end of in addition to changes in interest rates  the level of future net interest income is also dependent on a number of other variables  including the growth  composition and absolute levels of loans  deposits  and other earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  economic and competitive conditions  potential changes in lending  investing  and deposit gathering strategies  client preferences  and other factors 
the following table provides information about our financial instruments used for purposes other than trading that are rate sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december  it does not provide when these items may actually reprice 
for loans receivable  securities  and liabilities with contractual maturities  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by contractual maturities as well as our historical experience of the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the prepayment of loans and mortgage backed securities 
for core deposits demand deposits  interest bearing checking  savings  and money market deposits that have no contractual maturity  the table presents principal cash flows and  as applicable related weighted average interest rates based upon our historical experience  and management s judgment as applicable  concerning their most likely withdrawal behaviors 
the current historical interest rates for core deposits have been assumed to apply for future periods in this table as the actual interest rates that will need to be paid to maintain these deposits are not currently known 
weighted average variable rates are based upon contractual rates existing at the report date
