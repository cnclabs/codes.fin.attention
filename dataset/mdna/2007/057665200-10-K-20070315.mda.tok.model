major end product applications are baked goods  refrigerated and frozen dough systems  processed meats  seasoning blends  confections  nutritional supplementations  pharmaceuticals and animal nutrition 
we also market human grade choline nutrient products through this industry segment for wellness applications 
choline is recognized to play a key role in the structural integrity of cell membranes  processing dietary fat  reproductive development and neural functions  such as memory and muscle function 
balchem s portfolio of granulated calcium carbonate products are primarily used in novel over the counter and prescription pharmaceuticals for the treatment of osteoporosis  gastric disorders and calcium deficiencies in the united states 
management believes this segment s key strengths are its proprietary technology and end product application capabilities 
the success of the company s efforts to increase revenue in this segment is highly dependent on the timing of marketing launches of new products in the us and international food and nutrition markets by the company s customers and prospects 
the company  through its innovative proprietary technology and applications expertise  continues to develop new products designed to solve and respond to customer problems and innovative needs 
sales of specialty products for the animal nutrition and health industry are highly dependent on dairy industry economics as well as the ability of the company to leverage the results of existing successful university research on the animal health benefits of the company s products

critical accounting policies management of the company is required to make certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these estimates and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company s critical accounting policies are those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods 
management considers the following accounting policies to be critical 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon product shipment  passage of title and risk of loss  and when collection is reasonably assured 
the company reports amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling as revenue and includes costs incurred for shipping and handling in cost of sales 
amounts received for unshipped merchandise are not recognized as revenue but rather they are recorded as customer deposits and are included in current liabilities 
in addition  the company follows the provisions of the securities and exchange commission s sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which sets forth guidelines on the timing of revenue recognition based upon factors such as passage of title  installation  payments and customer acceptance 
revenue related to a process and product license agreement is recognized using the percentage of completion method and the progress to completion is measured using the efforts expended method 
the company follows the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
revenue is recognized as work is performed and costs are incurred 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or average or market value and have been reduced by an allowance for excess or obsolete inventories 
inventory reserves are generally recorded when the inventory for a product exceeds twelve months of demand for that product and or when individual products have been in inventory for greater than six months 
in november  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 inventory costs 
the new statement amends accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material 
this statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges and requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the cost of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of this statement were applied prospectively for inventory costs incurred beginning in our fiscal year the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flow 
long lived assets long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset  which is generally based on discounted cash flows 
goodwill  which is not subject to amortization  is tested annually for impairment  and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
if an indicator of impairment exists  the company determines the amount of impairment based on a comparison of the implied fair value of its goodwill to its carrying value 
accounts receivable we market our products to a diverse customer base  principally throughout the united states  europe  china and japan 
we grant credit terms in the normal course of business to our customers 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined through review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from customers and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
estimated losses are based on historical experience and any specific customer collection issues identified 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances and related bad debt expense may be required 
post employment benefits the company provides life insurance and health care benefits for eligible retirees and health care benefits for retirees eligible survivors 
the costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the company s assumptions as to general economic conditions and health care cost trends 
the cost of providing plan benefits also depends on demographic assumptions including retirements  mortality  turnover  and plan participation 
if actual experience differs from these assumptions  the cost of providing these benefits could increase or decrease 
in september  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
this statement requires an employer to recognize the over funded or under funded status of a defined benefit post retirement plan other than a multiemployer plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position  and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income 
as a result of adopting sfas no 
on december   we recorded million as a reduction to the benefit obligation and million  net of tax  as a one time adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
intangible assets with finite lives the useful life of an intangible asset is based on the company s assumptions regarding expected use of the asset  the relationship of the intangible asset to another asset or group of assets  any legal  regulatory or contractual provisions that may limit the useful life of the asset or that enable renewal or extension of the asset s legal or contractual life without substantial cost  the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors  and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset and their related impact on the asset s useful life 
if events or circumstances indicate that the life of an intangible asset has changed  it could result in higher future amortization charges or recognition of an impairment loss 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and would establish a valuation allowance if it believed that such assets may not be recovered  taking into consideration historical operating results  expectations of future earnings  changes in its operations and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
stock based compensation beginning in fiscal  we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r revised  share based payment sfas r as interpreted by sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating our stock price volatility  employee stock option exercise behaviors and employee option forfeiture rates 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the company s stock 
the expected term of the options is based on the company s historical experience of employees exercise behavior 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 
as a result of adopting sfas r  we recorded million of compensation expense  net of tax  in if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas r  the compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
under the accounting method we followed prior to january   we did not record any stock based compensation expense related to stock options granted to employees and directors for the years ended december  and if we had included the cost of employee stock option compensation in the financial statements for the years ended december  and  our net earnings would have decreased by approximately million and million  respectively  based on the fair value of the stock options granted to employees 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements  but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information 
this statement is effective beginning in january the company is evaluating whether adoption of this statement will result in a change to its fair value measurements 
in september  the sec issued sab  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab requires analysis of misstatements using both an income statement rollover approach and a balance sheet iron curtain approach in assessing materiality and provides for a one time cumulative effect transition adjustment 
sab is effective for the company s fiscal year annual financial statements 
the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
this interpretation  among other things  creates a two step approach for evaluating uncertain tax positions 
recognition step one occurs when an enterprise concludes that a tax position  based solely on its technical merits  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
measurement step two determines the amount of benefit that more likely than not will be realized upon settlement 
derecognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when a company subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not threshold of being sustained 
fin specifically prohibits the use of a valuation allowance as a substitute for derecognition of tax positions  and it has expanded disclosure requirements 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   in which the impact of adoption should be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings 
the company is evaluating fin and has not yet determined the impact the adoption will have on the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cash and cash equivalents are invested primarily in money market accounts 
accordingly  we believe we have limited exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates 
however  interest payable under the company s revolving facility is based on libor plus  and thus could expose the company to some interest rate risk in connection with its bank financing 
no amounts were drawn on the revolving facility as of december  the company has no derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments  nor does the company have any financial instruments entered into for trading or hedging purposes 
foreign sales are generally billed in us dollars 
the company believes that its business operations are not exposed in any material respect to market risk relating to foreign currency exchange risk or commodity price risk
