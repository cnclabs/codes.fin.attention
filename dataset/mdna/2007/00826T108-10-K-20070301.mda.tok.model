other collaborations broad institute of harvard and the massachusetts institute of technology 
in september  we entered into a supply and research collaboration agreement with the broad institute and massachusetts institute of technology 
the agreement provides affymetrix technology on preferential terms to the broad institute for applications development in return for the option to make commercial products available from the resulting research 
the collaboration is focused on whole genome snp analysis and high throughput expression analysis 
the affymetrix snp array was developed in collaboration with the broad institute to better identify and understand the genetic variations associated with complex diseases such as autism  autoimmunity  bipolar disease  cancer  diabetes and heart disease 
national cancer institute 
in january  we entered into a collaboration agreement with the national cancer institute on a human transcriptome initiative which seeks to construct maps locating the sites of rna transcription across the entire human genome using high density whole genome tiling arrays interrogating at resolutions and throughput rates never before attempted 
the transcriptome is defined as the complete collection of transcribed elements of the genome 
in addition to well characterized protein coding transcripts  it also represents non coding rnas that are used for structural and gene regulatory purposes 
alterations in the structure or levels of expression of any one of these rnas or their proteins could contribute to disease 
an understanding of the transcriptome may provide valuable insights in the research for novel drugs 
we have made the data from this initiative freely available to the public databases located at the national cancer institute  uc santa cruz  geneexpress  and affymetrix public websites 
this collaboration was extended during fiscal through mid to complete the transcript mapping of the entire human genome 
in addition to studies performed to detect sites of transcription our technology has been used to map sites of binding by transcription factor regulatory elements  modication of chromatin proteins and dna and genomic origins of dna replication 
caliper life sciences  inc in january  we signed a collaboration and supply agreement to develop and provide automated target preparation instruments for the genechip probe array system 
these new automation systems are expected to cut array processing  reduce variability and labor costs  and enable researchers to industrialize their genomic research 
the two companies will develop products that leverage caliper s expertise in high throughput automation and microfluidics with our expertise in microarray technology and applications 
the first products were launched in and automate genechip microarray target preparation steps including hybridization  washing and staining for expression and dna analysis 
the automated system enables a single operator to run up to rna samples at a time  compared to the manual rate of to samples 
in we launched the affymetrix genechip array station that has the capacity to process hundreds of biological samples per week with minimal human supervision  reducing operating costs and variability in target preparation 
the genechip array station is designed to perform target preparation for both cartridges and array plates as well as perform the wash and stain function for the array plates 
the genechip array station adapts the same industry standard genechip technology to a standard well microtiter plate  and runs on an automated system built with off the shelf robotic components 
capitalbio corporation  beijing china 
in december  we entered into an agreement with capitalbio corporation to develop and manufacture certain advanced instrumentation for affyemtrix microarray processing 
this agreement was amended in december to expand the scope of our original instrumentation development and supply agreement 
the new agreement establishes a basis for capitalbio to complete the development of the instrumentation 
as part of the agreement  capitalbio was also granted limited marketing and distribution rights for the instrumentation and associated consumables within china 
marketing and distribution the markets for our products include all aspects of molecular biology research in the life sciences  including basic human disease research  clinical research  pharmaceutical drug discovery and development  including pharmacogenomics and toxicogenomics and agricultural research  amongst others 
our customers include pharmaceutical  biotechnology  agrichemical  diagnostics  industrial and consumer products companies  as well as academic research centers  laboratories in government agencies  private research foundations and clinical and industrial reference laboratories 
the following factors  among others  influence the size and development of our markets the availability of genomic sequence and sequence variation data for the human population and for other organisms  technological innovation that increases throughput and lowers the cost of genomic and genetic analysis  the development of new computational techniques to handle and analyze large amounts of genomic data  the availability of government funding for basic and disease related research  the amount of capital and ongoing expenditures allocated to research and development and outsourced spending by biotechnology  pharmaceutical and diagnostic companies for products and services  the application of genomics to new areas including molecular diagnostics  agriculture  human identity and consumer goods  and the availability of genetic markers and signatures of diagnostic value 
in north america and major european markets  our genechip products are marketed principally through our own sales and distribution organizations 
we own or lease sales and service offices in the united states  europe  japan and singapore 
in markets outside of north america and europe  we sell our genechip products principally through third party distributors  primarily in mexico  india  the middle east and asia pacific  including china 
these distributors are life science supply specialists within their own countries and operate as our sole distributors within a defined country or other geographic area 
for molecular diagnostic and industrial applications market opportunities  we supply our partners with arrays and instruments  which they incorporate into diagnostic products and take on the primary commercialization responsibilities 
current collaborative partners include roche  biom rieux  veridex  a johnson johnson company and sysmex 
for additional information concerning our collaborative partners  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements collaborative agreements and item  business our collaborative partners on this form k 
manufacturing and raw materials we manufacture our genechip probe arrays  gcs scanner  fluidics stations  instrument control software and certain reagents in house and contract with third party suppliers to manufacture our hybridization oven  gcas and ht scanner and certain reagents for our genechip system 
additionally  through our genechip compatible application program  a number of third party software suppliers develop  market and sell genomic data analysis software that interfaces with data files generated by our genechip system 
our probe array manufacturing process involves wafer preparation  probe synthesis  dicing of synthesized wafers into chips  assembly of chips and quality control 
we have developed software programs that extensively automate the design of photolithographic masks used in probe array manufacturing and that control the probe array manufacturing lines 
glass wafers are prepared for synthesis through the application of chemical coatings 
genechip probe arrays are synthesized on the wafers using our proprietary  combinatorial photolithographic process 
the completed wafers can then be diced to yield individual probe arrays  which are assembled and packaged for shipment 
we are currently manufacturing genechip probe arrays for sale to customers as well as for internal and collaborative purposes 
probe arrays are manufactured at our dedicated manufacturing facility located in west sacramento  california and in our new manufacturing facility in singapore 
we also maintain a manufacturing process engineering and development facility in santa clara  california  and a manufacturing and development facility in bedford  massachusetts to support our instrumentation products 
in september  we announced our plan to close our bedford  massachusetts based instrumentation manufacturing and development facility 
we plan to consolidate the bedford facility s instrument manufacturing operations with our probe array manufacturing facility in west sacramento  california 
our instrumentation development capabilities will be consolidated with our principal research and development facilities located in santa clara  california 
implementation of the plan began in the fourth quarter of and is expected to continue into the first half of and will eliminate or transfer certain positions 
see note of notes of the consolidated financial statements on this form k 
all of our commercial instrument and array manufacturing facilities comply with good manufacturing practices as a subset of the quality system regulation cfr 
in  we added capacity to our west sacramento facility and brought on line and qualified a dedicated genechip probe array manufacturing facility located in singapore 
this facility is fully operational and expected to ramp to high volume production in in addition  we have put in place the capability to rapidly add incremental capacity if required by demand 
see item off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations for further information 
we perform quality tests on selected probe arrays from each wafer and selected probes on such probe arrays 
we largely rely on in process and internal quality control procedures  including controls on the manufacturing process and sample testing  to verify the correct completion of the manufacturing process 
in addition  we and our customers rely on the accuracy of genetic sequence information contained in the public databases upon which our products are based 
our probe array manufacturing process is designed to allow us to meet our performance specifications before arrays are shipped 
we have a customer inquiry and complaint process in place and we rely on this process to identify and resolve product performance issues that may arise from time to time 
we perform quality tests on in house and third party reagents at our santa clara facility to verify performance of reagent components and assembled reagent kits 
we have qualified second source vendors for labeling reagents and oligonucleotides 
we perform manufacturing and quality control testing on certain of our reagents at our south san francisco facility 
we also perform services to run certain of our assays on customer samples at our south san francisco facility 
key parts of the genechip product line  such as hybridization ovens are available from single sources 
we take such steps as we believe are appropriate to ensure that supplies from these vendors are not materially delayed or interrupted  since any such delays or interruptions could in turn delay our ability to deliver these products to our customers 
likewise  certain raw materials or components used in the synthesis of probe arrays or the assembly of instrumentation are currently available only from a single source or limited sources 
we take such steps as we believe are appropriate to ensure that materials and components from these vendors are not materially delayed or interrupted  since any such delays or interruptions could in turn delay our ability to produce probe arrays or other components for our genechip system in a timely fashion  in sufficient quantities or under acceptable terms 
alternative sources of supply may be time consuming and expensive to qualify 
in addition  we are dependent on our vendors to provide components of appropriate quality and reliability  and to meet applicable regulatory requirements 
accordingly  we also take what we believe are appropriate measures to prevent the delay or interruption of supplies from these vendors and to ensure the appropriate quality for our customers 
research and development we believe a substantial investment in research and development is essential to a long term sustainable competitive advantage and critical to expansion into high value markets such as toxicogenomics  pharmacogenomics  and molecular diagnostic and applied testing applications 
our research and development effort is divided into the major areas of basic research  product research and development  and manufacturing process development 
our research and development expenses for the years ended december   and  were million  million and million  respectively 
in addition  on october   we recorded a charge of approximately million to acquired in process technology related to our acquisition of parallele bioscience  inc parallele  a provider of comprehensive genetic discovery solutions to the life science research  pharmaceutical and diagnostic sectors 
basic research basic research efforts are carried out through our affymetrix research laboratories to further advance our genechip platform  develop new concepts that can be rapidly productized  and create innovations that will influence our business model in the future 
our initial focus is on basic technology research including high throughput systems  high resolution chip fabrication and detection  genotyping  and gene expression and analysis of the human transcriptome and of other model organism genomes 
we are focusing our genotyping research efforts on the development of new assays principally designed to perform whole genome analysis at various resolutions 
we believe that products based on this research will ultimately help researchers understand the molecular biology of genomes  to develop more effective therapeutics and help identify the diagnostic markers and tests useful in molecular diagnostic applications 
product research and development our product research and development efforts are focused primarily on expanding the applications of the genechip technology including development of new probe array products  improving the overall performance of genechip assays  increasing the information capacity per probe array and simplifying highly complex assays 
our research and development efforts are intended to continue to develop new products based on information from the human and other model organism genomes as well as new genotyping and dna analysis products 
in addition  we intend to continue developing custom product lines for both expression and dna analysis so that customers can analyze gene expression or dna variability for any organism 
we plan continued software and instrumentation development efforts to enhance the performance and level of automation of our entire genechip system solution 
manufacturing process and development we are conducting research aimed at enhancing the manufacturing process currently employed in the production of our genechip probe arrays 
this process  which leverages semiconductor photolithographic fabrication techniques  is combinatorial in that the number of different compounds synthesized grows exponentially with the number of cycles in the synthesis 
the objective of this research is to allow us to produce arrays with higher information density in the same unit area  similar to advances achieved in the semiconductor industry  which has produced silicon chip capacity closely following moore s law 
moore s law is the observation that the number of transistors per square inch on a silicon chip had doubled every months since the silicon chip was invented 
to date  we have also been able to achieve rapid advances in genetic information content  reducing commercial product feature size from microns in to microns in with the introduction of our human exon array product 
we are continuing research aimed at using smaller feature technology in commercial products and implementing novel  cost effective packaging approaches for the small array formats including packaging these into the standard industry microtiter plate format 
intellectual property we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  and trade secret laws  know how and licensing opportunities to establish and protect our proprietary technologies and products 
our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patent protection for our products and processes  to preserve our copyrights and trade secrets  to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties and to acquire licenses related to enabling technology or products used with our genechip technology 
we are pursuing a patent strategy designed to facilitate our research and development program and the commercialization of our current and future products 
while no one patent is considered essential to our success  we aggressively seek to protect our patent rights as our patent portfolio as a whole is material to the success of the business 
there are a significant number of united states and foreign patents and patent applications in our areas of interest  and we believe that there will continue to be significant litigation in the industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
others have filed  and in the future are likely to file  patent applications that are similar or identical to ours or those of our licensors 
it may be necessary for us to enter into litigation to defend against or assert claims of infringement  to enforce patents issued to us  to protect trade secrets or know how owned by us or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
to determine the priority of inventions  it may be necessary for us to participate in interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office 
litigation or interference proceedings could result in substantial costs to and distraction from our core business and our efforts in respect to such proceedings may not be successful 
for further information  see item legal proceedings 
we also rely upon copyright and trade secrets to protect our confidential and proprietary information 
we seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes by confidentiality agreements with our employees and certain consultants and contractors 
these agreements may be breached  we may not have adequate remedies for any breach and our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors 
to the extent that our employees or our consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us  disputes may also arise as to the rights in related or resulting know how and inventions 
we are party to various option  supply and license agreements with third parties which grant us rights to use certain aspects of our technologies 
we take such measures as we believe are appropriate to maintain rights to such technology under these agreements 
in addition  our academic collaborators have certain rights to publish data and information in which we have rights 
there is considerable pressure on academic institutions to publish discoveries in the genetics and genomics fields 
we take such steps as we believe are appropriate to ensure that such publication will not adversely affect our ability to obtain patent protection for information in which we may have a commercial interest 
competition competition in gene expression monitoring  dna analysis and molecular diagnostics is intense and is expected to increase 
further  the technologies for monitoring gene expression  discovering and analyzing polymorphisms associated with significant diseases  and approaches for commercializing those discoveries are new and rapidly evolving 
currently  our principal competition comes from existing technologies and other dna array technologies that are used to perform many of the same functions for which we market our genechip systems 
in the gene expression monitoring and dna analysis fields  existing competitive technologies include gel based sequencing using instruments provided by companies such as applied biosystems  inc an applera company  and beckman coulter  inc 
other companies developing or marketing potentially competitive dna array technology include agilent technologies  inc  applied biosystems  inc  bd biosciences  clontech  combimatrix corporation  digital gene technologies  inc  illumina  inc  invitrogen corporation formerly xeotron  inc  molecular devices  inc formerly axon instruments  inc  nanogen  inc  nimblegen systems  inc  sequenom  inc  solexa  inc 
formerly lynx therapeutics  inc  and visible genetics  inc 
for example  companies such as agilent technologies  inc  applied biosystems  inc  and illumina  inc have products for dna analysis which are directly competitive with our genechip mapping array products 
in order to compete against existing and emerging technologies  we will need to be successful in demonstrating to customers that the genechip system provides a competitive advantage 
the market for molecular diagnostic products derived from gene discovery is currently limited and highly competitive  with several large corporations already having significant market share 
established diagnostic companies could compete with us by developing new products 
companies such as abbott laboratories  bayer ag  beckman coulter  becton dickinson  biom rieux  johnson johnson and roche have the strategic commitment to diagnostics  the financial and other resources to invest in new technologies  substantial intellectual property portfolios  substantial experience in new product development  regulatory expertise  manufacturing capabilities and the distribution channels to deliver products to customers 
established diagnostic companies also have an installed base of instruments in several markets  including clinical and reference laboratories  which are not compatible with the genechip system and could slow acceptance of our products 
in addition  these companies have formed alliances with genomics companies which provide them access to genetic information that may be incorporated into their diagnostic tests 
future competition in existing and potential markets will likely come from existing competitors as well as other companies seeking to develop new technologies for sequencing and analyzing genetic information 
in addition  pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have significant needs for genomic information and may choose to develop or acquire competing technologies to meet these needs 
we have significantly expanded our network of approved service providers in america  japan  europe  and china 
while these companies expand the reach of affymetrix technology and make its analytical power available to a wider base of users they may act as a substitute for outright purchase of instruments and arrays by those end users 
in the molecular diagnostic field  competition will likely come from established diagnostic companies  companies developing and marketing dna probe tests for genetic and other diseases  and other companies conducting research on new technologies to ascertain and analyze genetic information 
in addition  we have several other third party licensees that could offer products that compete with our product offerings 
government regulation regulation by governmental authorities in the united states and other countries will likely be a significant factor in the manufacturing  labeling  distribution and marketing of certain products and services that may be developed by us or our collaborative partners 
in particular  diagnostic products we are developing with our collaborative partners may require regulatory approval by governmental agencies when distributed outside of the research environment 
commercially available diagnostic tests are regulated as medical devices and are generally subject to rigorous testing and other approval procedures by the united states food and drug administration fda 
the fda s quality system regulations also apply in connection with our manufacture of arrays and systems as components for use in diagnostic products developed by our partners 
obtaining these clearances or approvals and the compliance with these regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources over a significant period of time  and there can be no assurance that any clearances or approvals will be granted on a timely basis  if at all 
once granted  a clearance or approval may place substantial restrictions on how the device is marketed or labeled or to whom it may be sold 
in addition  various federal and state statutes and regulations govern or influence the manufacturing  safety  storage of our products and components of our products and our record keeping 
medical device laws and regulations  including those covering in vitro diagnostic products  are also in effect in the european union  and many of the countries in which we may do business outside the united states 
these range from comprehensive device approval requirements for some or all of our medical device products to requests for product data or self certifications 
we may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals in such countries or may incur significant costs in obtaining or maintaining our non us regulatory approvals 
in addition  the export by us of certain of our products which have not yet been cleared for domestic commercial distribution may be subject to fda or other export restrictions 
our diagnostic clinical laboratory will be subject to extensive federal and state regulation including the requirements of the clinical laboratory improvement act of clia 
clia is intended to ensure the quality and reliability of clinical laboratories in the united states by requiring all laboratories to meet specified standards in the areas of personnel qualification  administration  participation in proficiency testing  patient test management  quality control  quality assurance and inspections 
there can be no assurance that regulations under and future administrative interpretations of clia will not have an adverse impact on the potential market for our diagnostic clinical laboratory 
reimbursement the design of our products and the potential market for their use may be directly or indirectly affected by us and other government regulations governing reimbursement for clinical testing services 
the availability of third party reimbursement for our products and services may be limited or uncertain  particularly with respect to genetic tests and other clinical applications products 
third party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a prescribed health care product or service has not received appropriate fda or other governmental regulatory clearances  is not used in accordance with cost effective treatment methods as determined by the payor  or is deemed by the third party payor to be experimental  unnecessary or inappropriate 
furthermore  third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for health care products and services 
currently  sales of our products and services are not subject to third party reimbursement 
however  we are currently developing diagnostic and therapeutic products with our collaborative partners which may be subject to reimbursement issues 
the ability of our collaborators to commercialize such products may depend  in part  on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of these products will be available under us and foreign regulations governing reimbursement for clinical testing services by government authorities  private health insurers and other organizations 
in addition  we are establishing a diagnostic clinical laboratory which will provide subcontract services to primary clinical laboratories 
in the united states  third party payor price resistance  the trend towards managed health care and legislative proposals to reform health care or reduce government insurance programs could reduce prices for health care products and services  adversely affect the profits of our customers and collaborative partners and reduce our future royalties and product sales 
environmental matters we are dedicated to compliance and protection of the environment and individuals 
our operations require the use of hazardous materials including biological materials which subject us to a variety of federal  state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations 
we believe we are in material compliance with current and applicable laws and regulations 
however  some of the regulations under the current regulatory structure allow for strict liability  holding a party potentially liable without regard to fault or negligence 
we could be held liable for damages and fines as a result of our  or others  business operations should contamination of the environment or individual exposure to hazardous substances occur 
we cannot predict how changes in these laws or development of new regulations will affect our business operations or the cost of compliance 
employees as of february   we had  full time employees 
the employee group includes chemists  engineers  computer scientists  mathematicians and molecular biologists with experience in the diagnostic products  medical products  semiconductor  computer software and electronics industries 
none of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement  nor have we experienced work stoppages 
we believe that we maintain good relationships with our employees 
our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain skilled and experienced employees 
seasonality customer demand for probe arrays and instrumentation systems is typically highest in the fourth quarter of the calendar year as customers spend unused budget allocations before the end of the financial year 
backlog because most customer orders are shipped in the quarter in which they are received  we believe that backlog at quarter end is typically not a material indicator of future sales 
in addition  backlog may not result in sales because of cancellation of orders or other factors 
on a few occasions we have experienced  and made public announcements about  short term increases in backlog as a result of factors such as new product introductions or supply constraints 
financial information about industry segments we operate in one business segment  for the development  manufacture  and commercialization of systems for genetic analysis in the life sciences and diagnostic industry 
our operations are treated as one segment as we only report operating information on a total enterprise level to our chief operating decision makers 
further  resource allocations are also made at the enterprise level by our chief operating decision makers

item a 
risk factors in evaluating our business  you should carefully consider the following risks  as well as the other information contained in this annual report on form k 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business could be harmed 
we may not maintain profitability 
we incurred losses each year from our inception through the year ended december  and have incurred a loss for the year ended december  as a result  we had an accumulated deficit of million at december  we expect to continue experiencing fluctuations in our operating results and cannot assure sustained profitability 
our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development  manufacturing and from selling  general and administrative costs associated with our operations 
our ability to generate significant revenues and maintain profitability is dependent in large part on our ability to expand our customer base  increase sales of our current products to existing customers  manage our expense growth  and enter into additional supply  license and collaborative arrangements as well as on our ability and that of our collaborative partners to successfully manufacture and commercialize products incorporating our technologies in new applications and in new markets 
if our revenues grow more slowly than we anticipate  or if our operating expenses increase more than we expect or cannot be reduced in the event of lower revenues  our business will be materially and adversely affected 
our quarterly results have historically fluctuated significantly and may continue to fluctuate unpredictably and any failure to meet financial expectations may disappoint securities analysts or investors and result in a decline in our stock price 
our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly due in part to factors that are beyond our control and which we cannot predict 
the timing of our customers orders may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
however  we have historically experienced customer ordering patterns for genechip instrumentation and genechip arrays where the majority of the shipments occur in the last month of the quarter 
these ordering patterns may limit management s ability to accurately forecast our future revenues 
additionally  license revenue may also be unpredictable and may fluctuate due to the timing of payments of non recurring licensing fees 
because our expenses are largely fixed in the short to medium term  any material shortfall in revenues will materially reduce our profitability and may cause us to experience losses 
in particular  our revenue growth and profitability depend on sales of our genechip products 
factors that could cause sales for these products to fluctuate include competition our inability to produce products in sufficient quantities and with appropriate quality  the loss of or reduction in orders from key customers  the frequency of experiments conducted by our customers  our customers inventory of genechip products  the receipt of relatively large orders with short lead times  and our customers expectations as to how long it takes us to fill future orders 
some additional factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include weakness in the global economy and changing market conditions  general economic conditions affecting our target customers  changes in the amounts or timing of government funding to companies and research institutions  and changes in the attitude of the pharmaceutical industry towards the use of genetic information and genetic testing as a methodology for drug discovery and development 
we cannot forecast with any certainty the impact of these and other factors on our sales and operating results in any future period 
results of operations in any period  therefore  should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 
because of this difficulty in predicting future performance  our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors in some future quarter or quarters 
our failure in the past to meet these expectations has adversely affected the market price of our common stock and may continue to do so 
we may lose customers or experience lost sales if we are unable to manufacture our products and ensure their proper performance and quality 
we produce our genechip products in an innovative and complicated manufacturing process which has the potential for significant variability in manufacturing yields 
we have encountered and may in the future encounter difficulties in manufacturing our products and  due to the complexity of our products and our manufacturing process  we may not fully understand all of the factors that affect our manufacturing processes or product performance 
although we have taken steps to increase our manufacturing capacity  including the expansion of our existing west sacramento  california probe array manufacturing facility and the development of a new probe array manufacturing facility in singapore  there are uncertainties inherent in the expansion of our manufacturing capabilities 
for example  manufacturing and product quality issues may arise at the new singapore facility or as we increase production rates at our west sacramento facility and launch new products 
in addition  we base our manufacturing capabilities on our forecasted product mix for the quarter 
if the actual product mix varies significantly from our forecast  we may not be able to fill some orders during that quarter  which could adversely impact our financial results 
difficulties in meeting customer  collaborator and internal demand could also cause us to lose customers or require us to delay new product introductions  which could in turn result in reduced demand for our products 
we manufacture our genechip instrumentation products at our manufacturing facility in bedford  massachusetts 
in the third quarter of  we announced that we will be consolidating our bedford instrumentation manufacturing facility with our probe array manufacturing facility in west sacramento  california as part of our previously announced efforts to reduce expenses in the general and administrative functions including the rationalization of our facilities 
the successful reorganization of our instrumentation manufacturing capabilities to our west sacramento site will require regulatory approvals  including the registration of our west sacramento site with the united states fda  and is expected to be substantially completed by the third quarter of this transition is subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause interruptions in our ability to supply genechip instrumentation products to our customers  which could result in lost revenue and seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on internal quality control procedures to verify our manufacturing processes 
due to the complexity of our products and manufacturing process  however  it is possible that probe arrays that do not meet all of our performance specifications may not be identified before they are shipped 
if our products do not consistently meet our customers performance expectations  demand for our products will decline 
in addition  we do not maintain any backup manufacturing capabilities for the production of our genechip instruments 
any interruption in our ability to continue operations at our existing manufacturing facilities could delay our ability to develop or sell our products  which could result in lost revenue and seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to deliver acceptable products to our customers due to the rapidly evolving nature of genetic sequence information upon which our products are based 
the genetic sequence information upon which we rely to develop and manufacture our products is contained in a variety of public databases throughout the world 
these databases are rapidly expanding and evolving 
in addition  the accuracy of such databases and resulting genetic research is dependent on various scientific interpretations and it is not expected that global genetic research efforts will result in standardized genetic sequence databases for particular genomes in the near future 
although we have implemented ongoing internal quality control efforts to help ensure the quality and accuracy of our products  the fundamental nature of our products requires us to rely on genetic sequence databases and scientific interpretations which are continuously evolving 
as a result  these variables may cause us to develop and manufacture products that incorporate sequence errors or ambiguities 
the magnitude and importance of these errors depends on multiple and complex factors that would be considered in determining the appropriate actions required to remedy any inaccuracies 
our inability to timely deliver acceptable products as a result of these factors would likely adversely affect our relationship with customers  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face risks associated with technological obsolescence and emergence of standardized systems for genetic analysis 
the rna dna probe array field is undergoing rapid technological changes 
new technologies  techniques or products could emerge which might allow the packaging and analysis of genomic information at densities similar to or higher than our microarray technology 
other companies may begin to offer products that are directly competitive with  or are technologically superior  to our products 
there can be no guarantee that we will be able to maintain our technological advantages over emerging technologies in the future 
over time  we will need to respond to technological innovation in a rapidly changing industry 
in addition  although we believe that we are recognized as a market leader in creating systems for genetic analysis in the life sciences  standardization of tools and systems for genetic research is still ongoing and there can be no assurance that our products will emerge as the standard for genetic research 
the emergence of competing technologies and systems as market standards for genetic research may result in our products becoming uncompetitive and could cause our business to suffer 
our success depends on the continual development of new products and our ability to manage the transition from our older products to new products 
we compete in markets that are new  intensely competitive  highly fragmented and rapidly changing  and many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do 
in addition  many current and potential competitors have greater name recognition  more extensive customer bases and access to proprietary genetic content 
the continued success of our genechip products will depend on our ability to produce products with smaller feature sizes  our ability to dice the wafer  and create greater information capacity at our current or lower costs 
the successful development  manufacture and introduction of our new products is a complicated process and depends on our ability to manufacture enough products in sufficient quantity and at acceptable cost in order to meet customer demand 
if we fail to keep pace with emerging technologies or are unable to develop  manufacture and introduce new products  including the development of new assay protocols and training our customers  we will become uncompetitive  our pricing and margins will decline and our business will suffer 
our failure to successfully manage the transition between our older products and our new products may adversely affect our financial results 
as we introduce new or enhanced products  we must successfully manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customers ordering patterns  avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and provide sufficient supplies of new products to meet customer demands 
when we introduce new or enhanced products  we face numerous risks relating to product transitions  including the inability to accurately forecast demand and difficulties in managing different sales and support requirements due to the type or complexity of the new products 
if we do not attract and retain key employees  our business could be impaired 
to be successful  we must attract and retain qualified scientific  engineering  manufacturing  sales  and management personnel 
to expand our research  product development and sales efforts we need additional people skilled in areas such as bioinformatics  organic chemistry  information services  regulatory affairs  manufacturing  sales  marketing and technical support 
competition for these people is intense 
we will not be able to expand our business if we are unable to hire  train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in hiring or retaining qualified personnel and our failure to do so could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we also rely on our scientific advisors and consultants to assist us in formulating our research  development and commercialization strategy 
all of these individuals are engaged by other employers and have commitments to other entities that may limit their availability to us 
a scientific advisor s other obligations may prevent him or her from assisting us in developing our technical and business strategies 
we expect to face increasing competition 
future competition will likely come from existing competitors as well as other companies seeking to develop new technologies for analyzing genetic information 
for example  companies such as agilent technologies  applied biosystems  and illumina have products for genetic analysis which are directly competitive with our genechip products 
in addition  pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have significant needs for genomic information and may choose to develop or acquire competing technologies to meet these needs 
in the molecular diagnostics field  competition will likely come from established diagnostic companies  companies developing and marketing dna probe tests for genetic and other diseases and other companies conducting research on new technologies to ascertain and analyze genetic information 
further  in the event that we develop new technology and products that compete with existing technology and products of well established companies  there can be no guarantee that the marketplace will readily adopt any such new technology and products that we may introduce in the future 
the market for molecular diagnostics products is currently limited and highly competitive  with several large companies already having significant market share 
companies such as abbott laboratories  bayer ag  beckman coulter  becton dickinson  biom rieux  celera diagnostics  johnson johnson and roche diagnostics have made strategic commitments to diagnostics  have financial and other resources to invest in new technologies  and have substantial intellectual property portfolios  substantial experience in new product development  regulatory expertise  manufacturing capabilities and the distribution channels to deliver products to customers 
established diagnostic companies also have an installed base of instruments in several markets  including clinical and reference laboratories  which are not compatible with the genechip system and could deter acceptance of our products 
in addition  these companies have formed alliances with genomics companies which provide them access to genetic information that may be incorporated into their diagnostic tests 
recent accounting pronouncements may impact our future financial position and results of operations 
there have been new accounting pronouncements that may have an impact on our future financial position and results of operations 
for instance  in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
under fin a company would recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position 
fin clarifies how a company would measure the income tax benefits from the tax positions that are recognized  provides guidance as to the timing of the derecognition of previously recognized tax benefits and describes the methods for classifying and disclosing the liabilities within the financial statements for any unrecognized tax benefits 
fin also addresses when a company should record interest and penalties related to tax positions and how the interest and penalties may be classified within the income statement and presented in the balance sheet 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and is required to be adopted by us effective january  the cumulative effects  if any  of applying fin will be recorded as an adjustment to accumulated deficit as of the beginning of the period of adoption 
we are currently evaluating fin and its possible impacts on our financial statements and are not yet in a position to determine such effects  if any 
our effective tax rate may vary significantly 
our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions 
significant estimates and judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
some of these estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations 
the ultimate amount of tax liability may be uncertain as a result 
certain jurisdictions have lower tax rates  and the amount of earnings in these jurisdictions may fluctuate 
if we do not have profitable operations in these jurisdictions  our tax rate could be adversely impacted 
changes in tax laws and regulatory requirements in the countries in which we operate could have a material impact on our tax provision 
to the extent that we are unable to continue to reinvest a substantial portion of our profits in our foreign operations  we may be subject to additional effective income tax rate increases in the future 
tax authorities may challenge the allocation of profits between our subsidiaries and we may not prevail in any such challenge 
if we were not to prevail  we could be subject to higher tax rates or double tax 
we rely on our ability to project future taxable income to assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax asset will be realized 
to the extent we believe that realization is not more likely than not  we establish a valuation allowance 
significant estimates are required in determining any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
changes in the amount of valuation allowance required may adversely impact our financial results of operations 
other factors that could affect our effective tax rate include levels of research and development spending and nondeductible expenses such as stock based compensation or merger related expenditures 
our business depends on research and development spending levels for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic and governmental research institutions 
we expect that our revenues in the foreseeable future will be derived primarily from products and services provided to a relatively small number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic  governmental and other research institutions 
our success will depend upon their demand for and use of our products and services 
our operating results may fluctuate substantially due to reductions and delays in research and development expenditures by these customers 
for example  reductions in capital expenditures by these customers may result in lower than expected instrumentation sales and similarly  reductions in operating expenditures by these customers could result in lower than expected genechip array and reagent sales 
these reductions and delays may result from factors that are not within our control  such as changes in economic conditions  changes in government programs that provide funding to companies and research institutions  changes in the regulatory environment affecting life sciences companies and life sciences research  market driven pressures on companies to consolidate and reduce costs  and other factors affecting research and development spending 
our success in penetrating emerging market opportunities in molecular diagnostics depends on the efforts of our partners and the ability of our genechip technologies to be used in clinical applications for diagnosing and informing the treatment of disease 
the clinical applications of genechip technologies for diagnosing and informing the treatment of disease is an emerging market opportunity in molecular diagnostics that seeks to improve the effectiveness of health care by collecting information about dna variation and rna expression in patients at various times from diagnosis through prognosis and on to the end of therapy 
however  there can be no assurances that molecular diagnostic markets will develop as quickly as we expect or reach what we believe is their full potential 
although we believe that there will be clinical applications of our genechip technologies that will be utilized for diagnosing and informing the treatment of disease  there can be no certainty of the technical or commercial success our technologies will achieve in such markets 
the molecular diagnostics market is relatively new for us and presents us with new risks and uncertainties 
our success in this area depends to a large extent on our collaborative relationships and the ability of our collaborative partners to successfully market and sell products using our genechip technologies 
as a result  we are also dependent on the ability of our collaborative partners to achieve regulatory approval for such products in the united states and in overseas markets 
although roche received fda approval of the first diagnostic genotyping test for use with our genechip system dx in late  there can be no assurance that other products using our genechip technologies will achieve needed approvals 
we may not successfully obtain regulatory approval of any diagnostic or other product or service that we or our collaborative partners develop 
the fda must approve certain in vitro diagnostic products before they can be marketed in the us certain in vitro diagnostic products must also be approved by the regulatory agencies of foreign governments or jurisdictions before the product can be sold outside the us commercialization of our and our collaborative partners in vitro diagnostic products outside of the research environment that may depend upon successful completion of clinical trials 
clinical development is a long  expensive and uncertain process and we do not know whether we  or any of our collaborative partners  will be permitted to undertake clinical trials of any potential in vitro diagnostic products 
it may take us or our collaborative partners many years to complete any such testing  and failure can occur at any stage 
delays or rejections of potential products may be encountered based on changes in regulatory policy for product approval during the period of product development and regulatory agency review 
moreover  if and when our projects reach clinical trials  we or our collaborative partners may decide to discontinue development of any or all of these projects at any time for commercial  scientific or other reasons 
any of the foregoing matters could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
even where a product is exempted from fda clearance or approval  the fda may impose restrictions as to the types of customers to which we can market and sell our products 
such restrictions may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
medical device laws and regulations are also in effect in many countries  ranging from comprehensive device approval requirements to requests for product data or certifications 
the number and scope of these requirements are increasing 
we may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals in such countries or may incur significant costs in obtaining or maintaining our foreign regulatory approvals 
in addition  the export by us of certain of our products which have not yet been cleared for domestic commercial distribution may be subject to fda or other export restrictions 
our diagnostic clinical laboratory is subject to extensive federal and state regulation including the requirements of the clinical laboratory improvement act of clia 
clia is intended to ensure the quality and reliability of clinical laboratories in the united states by requiring all laboratories to meet specified standards in the areas of personnel qualification  administration  participation in proficiency testing  patient test management  quality control  quality assurance and inspections 
there can be no assurance that regulations under and future administrative interpretations of clia will not have an adverse impact on the potential market for our diagnostic clinical laboratory 
healthcare reform and restrictions on reimbursements may limit our returns on molecular diagnostic products that we may develop with our collaborators 
we are currently developing diagnostic and therapeutic products with our collaborators 
the ability of our collaborators to commercialize such products may depend  in part  on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of these products will be available under us and foreign regulations that govern reimbursement for clinical testing services by government authorities  private health insurers and other organizations 
in the us  third party payor price resistance  the trend towards managed health care and legislative proposals to reform health care or reduce government insurance programs could reduce prices for health care products and services  adversely affect the profits of our customers and collaborative partners and reduce our future royalties 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers and we will be unable to manufacture our products if shipments from these suppliers are delayed or interrupted 
we depend on our vendors to provide components of our products in required volumes  at appropriate quality and reliability levels  and in compliance with regulatory requirements 
key parts of the genechip product line are currently available only from a single source or limited sources 
in addition  components of our manufacturing equipment and certain raw materials used in the synthesis of probe arrays are available from limited sources 
if supplies from these vendors were delayed or interrupted for any reason  we would not be able to get manufacturing equipment  produce probe arrays  or sell scanners or other components for our genechip products in a timely fashion or in sufficient quantities or under acceptable terms 
furthermore  our business is dependent on our ability to forecast the needs for components and products in the genechip product line and our suppliers ability to deliver such components and products in time to meet critical manufacturing and product release schedules 
our business could be adversely affected  for example  if suppliers fail to meet product release schedules  if we experience supply constraints  if we fail to negotiate favorable pricing or if we experience any other interruption or delay in the supply chain which interferes with our ability to manufacture our products or manage our inventory levels 
our success will require that we establish a strong intellectual property position and that we can defend ourselves against intellectual property claims from others 
maintaining a strong patent position is critical to our business 
litigation on these matters has been prevalent in our industry and we expect that this will continue 
patent law relating to the scope of claims in the technology fields in which we operate is still evolving and the extent of future protection is highly uncertain  so there can be no assurance that the patent rights that we have or may obtain will be valuable 
others have filed  and in the future are likely to file  patent applications that are similar or identical to ours or those of our licensors 
to determine the priority of inventions  we will have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office that could result in substantial costs in legal fees and could substantially affect the scope of our patent protection 
we cannot assure investors that any such patent applications will not have priority over our patent applications 
also  our intellectual property may be subject to significant administrative and litigation proceedings such as opposition proceedings against our patents in europe  japan and other jurisdictions 
because of the size and breadth of our patent portfolio we may or may not chose to pursue litigation or interferences against those that have infringed on our patents  or used them without authorization  due to the associated expense and time commitment of monitoring these activities 
in addition  we have incurred and may in future periods incur substantial costs in litigation to defend against patent suits brought by third parties or initiated by us 
for example  we currently are engaged in litigation regarding intellectual property rights with enzo life sciences  inc for additional information concerning intellectual property litigation and administrative proceedings  see part i  item legal proceedings of this form k 
if we fail to protect or to enforce our intellectual property rights successfully  our competitive position could suffer  which could harm our results of operations 
in addition to patent protection  we also rely upon copyright and trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information 
there can be no assurance  however  that such measures will provide adequate protection for our copyrights  trade secrets or other proprietary information 
in addition  there can be no assurance that trade secrets and other proprietary information will not be disclosed  or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to or disclose our trade secrets and other proprietary information 
there can also be no assurance that we will be able to effectively protect our copyrights  trade secrets or other proprietary information 
if we cannot obtain  maintain or enforce intellectual property rights  our competitors may be able to offer probe array systems similar to our genechip technology 
our success also depends in part on us neither infringing patents or other proprietary rights of third parties nor breaching any licenses that may relate to our technologies and products 
we are aware of third party patents that may relate to our technology  including reagents used in probe array synthesis and in probe array assays  probe array scanners  synthesis techniques  polynucleotide amplification techniques  assays  and probe arrays 
we routinely receive notices claiming infringement from third parties as well as invitations to take licenses under third party patents 
there can be no assurance that we will not infringe on these patents or other patents or proprietary rights or that we would be able to obtain a license to such patents or proprietary rights on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to maintain our relationships with collaborative partners  we may have difficulty developing and selling our products and services 
we believe that our success in penetrating our target markets depends in part on our ability to develop and maintain collaborative relationships with key companies as well as with key academic researchers 
currently  our significant collaborative partners include qiagen gmbh for sample preparation and purification systems  invitrogen corporation for reagents  and ingenuity systems  inc for analytical software 
we collaborate with both beckman coulter inc and caliper life sciences in the development of automation for genechip technology applications for use in drug discovery  drug development and clinical research 
roche  biom rieux and veridex are collaborative partners in the development of chip products for medical diagnostic and applied testing markets 
relying on these or other collaborative relationships is risky to our future success because our partners may develop technologies or components competitive with our genechip products  our existing collaborations may preclude us from entering into additional future arrangements  our partners may not obtain regulatory approvals necessary to continue the collaborations in a timely manner  some of our agreements may terminate prematurely due to disagreements between us and our partners  our partners may not devote sufficient resources to the development and sale of our products  our partners may be unable to provide the resources required for us to progress in the collaboration on a timely basis  our collaborations may be unsuccessful  or we may not be able to negotiate future collaborative arrangements on acceptable terms 
the size and structure of our current sales  marketing and technical support organizations may limit our ability to sell our products 
although we have invested significant other resources to expand our direct sales force and our technical and support staff  we may not be able to establish a sufficiently sized global sales  marketing or technical support organization to sell  market or support our products globally 
to assist our sales and support activities  we have entered into distribution agreements through certain distributors  principally in markets outside of north america and europe 
these and other third parties on whom we rely for sales  marketing and technical support in these geographic areas may decide to develop and sell competitive products or otherwise become our competitors  which could harm our business 
due to the international nature of our business  political or economic changes or other factors could harm our business 
a significant amount of our revenue is currently generated from sales outside the united states 
though such transactions are denominated in both us dollars and foreign currencies  our future revenue  gross margin  expenses and financial condition are still affected by such factors as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  unexpected changes in  or impositions of  legislative or regulatory requirements  including export and trade barriers and taxes  longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection 
we are also subject to general geopolitical risks in connection with international operations  such as political  social and economic instability  potential hostilities and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships 
we cannot assure investors that one or more of the foregoing factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results or require us to modify our current business practices 
we may be exposed to liability due to product defects 
the risk of product liability claims is inherent in the testing  manufacturing  marketing and sale of human diagnostic and therapeutic products 
we may seek to acquire additional insurance for clinical liability risks 
we may not be able to obtain such insurance or general product liability insurance on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts 
a product liability claim or recall could have a serious adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
ethical  legal and social concerns surrounding the use of genetic information could reduce demand for our products 
genetic testing has raised ethical issues regarding privacy and the appropriate uses of the resulting information 
for these reasons  governmental authorities may call for limits on or regulation of the use of genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions  particularly for those that have no known cure 
similarly  such concerns may lead individuals to refuse to use genetics tests even if permissible 
any of these scenarios could reduce the potential markets for our molecular diagnostic products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our strategic equity investments may result in losses 
we periodically make strategic equity investments in various publicly traded and non publicly traded companies with businesses or technologies that may complement our business 
the market values of these strategic equity investments may fluctuate due to market conditions and other conditions over which we have no control 
other than temporary declines in the market price and valuations of the securities that we hold in other companies will require us to record losses relative to our ownership interest 
this could result in future charges on our earnings and as a result  it is uncertain whether or not we will realize any long term benefits associated with these strategic investments 
future acquisitions may disrupt our business and distract our management 
we have previously engaged in acquisitions and may do so in the future in order to exploit technology or market opportunities 
if we acquire another company  we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired business into our existing business in a timely and non disruptive manner  or at all 
furthermore  an acquisition may not produce the revenues  earnings or business synergies that we anticipate 
if we fail to integrate the acquired business effectively  commercialize the acquired technology  or if key employees of that business leave  the anticipated benefits of an acquisition would be jeopardized 
the time  capital management and other resources spent on an acquisition that fails to meet our expectations could cause our business and financial condition to be materially and adversely affected 
for example  on october   we completed the acquisition of parallele bioscience  inc we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition because of integration and other challenges which include  among others  unanticipated incompatibility of corporate and administrative infrastructures  the ability to retain key employees  including key scientists  the diversion of management s attention from ongoing business concerns  and the potential adverse reaction of customers to an acquisition or resulting changes to the combined company s product and services offerings 
in addition  acquisitions can involve substantial charges of stock based compensation that could adversely affect our results of operations 
the market price of our common stock has been volatile 
the market price of our common stock is volatile 
to demonstrate this volatility  during the twelve month period ending on december   the volume of our common stock traded on any given day ranged from  to  shares 
moreover  during that period  our common stock traded as low as per share and as high as per share 
furthermore  volatility in the stock price of other companies has often led to securities class action litigation against those companies 
any future securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  which could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the matters relating to our internal review of our historical stock option granting practices and the restatement of our consolidated financial statements may have a material adverse effect on us 
during  we conducted an internal review  performed under the direction of our audit committee of the board of directors  of our historical stock option granting practices from january  through may  as a result of this review  we restated our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and to record additional non cash stock based compensation expense and the related tax impact resulting from stock options granted during fiscal years to we have been  and may in the future be  subject to litigation or other proceedings or actions arising in relation to our historical stock option granting practices and the restatement of our prior period financial statements 
for example  three purported derivative lawsuits have been filed against us and several of our current and former officers and directors alleging that the defendants breached their fiduciary duty by backdating stock option grants  as well as violations of federal securities laws in connection with the dissemination of our financial and proxy statements  violations of generally accepted accounting principles  violations of section m of the internal revenue code and violations of state law including violation of the california corporations code 
in addition  we have received notice from the securities and exchange commission that it is conducting an informal inquiry into our stock option practices 
litigation and any potential regulatory proceeding or action may be time consuming  expensive and distracting from the conduct of our business 
the adverse resolution of any specific lawsuit or any potential regulatory proceeding or action could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
also  as a result of our delayed filing our form q for the quarter ended june   we will be ineligible to register our securities on form s for sale by us or resale by others until we have timely filed all periodic reports under the securities exchange act of for one year 
we may use form s to raise capital or complete acquisitions  which could increase transaction costs and adversely affect our ability to raise capital or complete acquisitions of other companies during this period
