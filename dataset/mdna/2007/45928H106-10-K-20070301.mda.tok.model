item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements that include numerous risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements as a result of these risks and uncertainties  including those set forth in this annual report on form k under special note regarding forward looking statements and under risk factors 
you should read the following discussion in conjunction with selected financial data and audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of international coal group  inc and its subsidiaries and the audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of horizon nr  llc  each appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
as discussed in note to horizon nr  llc s combined financial statements  horizon s financial statements have been restated 
the accompanying management discussion and analysis gives effect to that restatement 

table of contents overview we produce  process and sell steam coal from regional mining complexes  which  as of december  were supported by active underground mines  active surface mines and eight preparation plants located throughout west virginia  kentucky  maryland and illinois 
we have three reportable business segments  which are based on the coal regions in which we operate i central appalachian  comprised of both surface and underground mines  ii northern appalachian  also comprised of both surface and underground mines and iii illinois basin  representing one underground mine 
for more information about our reportable business segments  please see our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the audited consolidated financial statements and notes of horizon and its predecessors  each appearing elsewhere in this report 
we also broker coal produced by others  the majority of which is shipped directly from the third party producer to the ultimate customer 
our steam coal sales are primarily to large utilities and industrial customers in the eastern region of the united states 
in addition  we generate other revenues from the manufacture and operation of highwall mining systems  parts sales and shop services relating to those systems and coal handling and processing fees 
icg  inc was formed by wl ross co 
llc wlr and other investors in may to acquire and operate competitive coal mining facilities 
international coal group  inc was formed in march and became the parent holding company pursuant to a reorganization on november  through the acquisition of key assets from the horizon bankruptcy estate  the wlr investor group was able to target properties strategically located in appalachia and the illinois basin with high quality reserves that are union free  have limited reclamation liabilities and are substantially free of legacy liabilities 
with the proceeds of our december public offering  we retired substantially all of our then outstanding debt 
consistent with the wlr investor group s strategy to acquire attractive coal assets  the anker and coalquest acquisitions further diversified our reserves in november our primary expenses are wages and benefits  repair and maintenance expenditures  diesel fuel purchases  blasting supplies  coal transportation costs  cost of purchased coal  royalties  freight and handling costs and taxes incurred in selling our coal 
certain trends and economic factors affecting the coal industry our revenues depend on the price at which we are able to sell our coal 
the recent pricing environment for domestic steam coal is relatively weak 
further decreases in coal prices due to  among other reasons  the supply of domestic and foreign coal  the demand for electricity and the price and availability of alternative fuels for electricity generation could adversely affect our revenues and our ability to generate cash flows 
in addition  our results of operations depend on the cost of coal production 
we are experiencing increased operating costs for fuel and explosives  steel products  tires  health care and labor 
we also expect to experience higher costs for surety bonds and letters of credit 
in addition  historically low interest rates have had a negative impact on expenses related to our actuarially determined employee related liabilities 
for additional information regarding some of the risks and uncertainties that affect our business and the industry in which we operate  see item a 
risk factors 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management evaluates its estimates on an on going basis 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from the estimates used 
note to our audited consolidated financial 
table of contents statements provides a description of all significant accounting policies 
we believe that of these significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity revenue recognition coal revenues result from sales contracts long term coal agreements or purchase orders with electric utilities  industrial companies or other coal related organizations  primarily in the eastern united states 
revenue is recognized and recorded at the time of shipment or delivery to the customer  at fixed or determinable prices and the title or risk of loss has passed in accordance with the terms of the sales agreement 
under the typical terms of these agreements  risk of loss transfers to the customers at the mine or port  where coal is loaded to the rail  barge  truck or other transportation sources that deliver coal to its destination 
freight and handling costs paid to third party carriers and invoiced to coal customers are recorded as freight and handling costs and freight and handling revenues  respectively 
other revenues consist of equipment and parts sales  equipment rebuild and maintenance services  coal handling and processing  royalties  ash disposal services  coalbed methane sales  coal contract buydown income  contract mining and rental income 
with respect to other revenues recognized in situations unrelated to the shipment of coal  we carefully review the facts and circumstances of each transaction and apply the relevant accounting literature as appropriate and do not recognize revenue until the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
advance payments received are deferred and recognized in revenue as coal is shipped or rental income is earned 
reclamation our asset retirement obligations arise from the federal surface mining control and reclamation act of and similar state statutes  which require that mine property be restored in accordance with specified standards and an approved reclamation plan 
significant reclamation activities include reclaiming refuse and slurry ponds  reclaiming the pit and support acreage at surface mines and sealing portals at deep mines 
we account for the costs of our reclamation activities in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
we determine the future cash flows necessary to satisfy our reclamation obligations on a mine by mine basis based upon current permit requirements and various estimates and assumptions  including estimates of disturbed acreage  cost estimates and assumptions regarding productivity 
estimates of disturbed acreage are determined based on approved mining plans and related engineering data 
cost estimates are based upon third party costs 
productivity assumptions are based on historical experience with the equipment that is expected to be utilized in the reclamation activities 
we determine the fair value of our asset retirement obligations in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
in order to determine fair value  we must also estimate a discount rate and third party margin 
each is discussed further below discount rate 
sfas no 
requires that asset retirement obligations be recorded at fair value 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 we utilize discounted cash flow techniques to estimate the fair value of our obligations 
we base our discount rate on the rates of treasury bonds with maturities similar to expected mine lives  adjusted for our credit standing 
third party margin 
sfas no 
requires the measurement of an obligation to be based upon the amount a third party would demand to assume the obligation 
because we plan to perform a significant amount of the reclamation activities with internal resources  a third party margin was added to the estimated costs of these activities 
this margin was estimated based upon our historical experience with contractors performing certain types of reclamation activities 
the inclusion of this margin will result in a recorded obligation that is greater than our estimates of our cost to perform the reclamation activities 
if our cost estimates are accurate  the excess of the recorded obligation over the cost incurred to perform the work will be recorded as a gain at the time that reclamation work is completed 

table of contents on at least an annual basis  we review our entire reclamation liability and make necessary adjustments for permit changes as granted by state authorities  additional costs resulting from accelerated mine closures and revisions to cost estimates and productivity assumptions to reflect current experience 
at december   we had recorded asset retirement obligation liabilities of million  including amounts reported as current liabilities 
while the precise amount of these future costs cannot be determined with certainty  as of december   we estimate that the aggregate undiscounted cost of final mine closure is approximately million 
depreciation  depletion and amortization property  plant  equipment and mine development  which includes coal lands  are recorded at cost  which includes construction overhead and interest  where applicable 
expenditures for major renewals and betterments are capitalized while expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred 
coal land costs are depleted using the units of production method  based on estimated recoverable interest 
the coal lands fair values are established by either using engineering studies or market values as established when coal lands are purchased on the open market 
these values are then evaluated as to the number of recoverable tons contained in a particular mining area 
once the coal land values are established  and the number of recoverable tons contained in a particular coal land area is determined  a units of production depletion rate can be calculated 
this rate is then utilized to calculate depletion expense for each period mining is conducted on a particular coal lands area 
any uncertainty surrounding the application of the depletion policy is directly related to the assumptions as to the number of recoverable tons contained in a particular coal land area 
the amount of compensation paid for the coal lands is a set amount  however  the recoverable tons contained in the coal land area are based on engineering estimates which can  and often do  change as the tons are mined 
any change in the number of recoverable tons contained in a coal land area will result in a change in the depletion rate and corresponding depletion expense 
for the year ended december   we recorded million of depletion expense 
mine development costs are amortized using the units of production method  based on estimated recoverable tons in the same manner described above 
other property  plant and equipment are depreciated using the straight line method based on estimated useful lives 
asset impairments we follow sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which requires that projected future cash flows from use and disposition of assets be compared with the carrying amounts of those assets 
when the sum of projected cash flows is less than the carrying amount  impairment losses are recognized 
in determining such impairment losses  discounted cash flows are utilized to determine the fair value of the assets being evaluated 
also  in certain situations  expected mine lives are shortened because of changes to planned operations 
when that occurs and it is determined that the mine s underlying costs are not recoverable in the future  reclamation and mine closing obligations are accelerated and the mine closing accrual is increased accordingly 
to the extent it is determined asset carrying values will not be recoverable during a shorter mine life  a provision for such impairment is recognized 
recognition of an impairment will decrease asset values  increase operating expenses and decrease net income 
postretirement medical benefits some of our subsidiaries have long and short term liabilities for postretirement benefit cost obligations 
detailed information related to these liabilities is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
liabilities for postretirement benefits are not funded 
the liability is actuarially determined and we use various actuarial assumptions  including the discount rate and future cost trends  to estimate the costs and obligations for postretirement benefits 
the discount rate assumption reflects the rates 
table of contents available on high quality fixed income debt instruments 
the discount rate used to determine the net periodic benefit cost for postretirement medical benefits was for the year ended december  we make assumptions related to future trends for medical care costs in the estimates of retiree health care and work related injury and illness obligations 
the future health care cost trend rate represents the rate at which health care costs are expected to increase over the life of the plan 
the health care cost trend rate assumptions are determined primarily based upon our historical rate of change in retiree health care costs 
the postretirement expense in the operating period ended december  was based on an assumed heath care inflationary rate of in the operating period decreasing to in  which represents the ultimate health care cost trend rate for the remainder of the plan life 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed ultimate health care cost trend rate would increase the service and interest cost components of the postretirement benefit expense for the year ended december  by million and increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at december  by million 
a one percentage point decrease in the assumed ultimate health care cost trend rate would decrease the service and interest cost components of the postretirement benefit expense for the year ended december  by million and decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at december  by million 
if our assumptions do not materialize as expected  actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates 
additionally  regulatory changes could increase our requirement to satisfy these or additional obligations 
workers compensation workers compensation is a system by which individuals who sustain personal injuries due to job related accidents are compensated for their disabilities  medical costs and  on some occasions  for the costs of their rehabilitation  and by which the survivors of workers who suffer fatal injuries receive compensation for lost financial support 
the workers compensation laws are administered by state agencies with each state having its own rules and regulations regarding compensation that is owed to an employee who is injured in the course of employment or the beneficiary of an employee that suffers fatal injuries in the course of employment 
our operations are covered through a combination of participation in a state run program and insurance policies 
our estimates of these costs are adjusted based upon actuarially determined amounts 
coal workers pneumoconiosis we are responsible under various federal statutes  and various states statutes  for the payment of medical and disability benefits to eligible employees resulting from occurrences of coal workers pneumoconiosis disease black lung 
our operations are covered through a combination of participation in a state run program and insurance policies 
we accrue for any self insured liability by recognizing costs when it is probable that a covered liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
our estimates of these costs are adjusted based upon actuarially determined amounts 
at december   we have recorded an accrual of million for black lung benefits 
individual losses in excess of million at the state level and million at the federal level are covered by our large deductible stop loss insurance 
actual losses may differ from these estimates  which could increase or decrease our costs 
coal industry retiree health benefit act of the coal industry retiree health benefit act of the coal act provides for the funding of health benefits for certain union retirees and their spouses or dependants 
the coal act established the combined fund into which employers who are signatory operators and related persons are obligated to pay annual premiums for beneficiaries 
the coal act also created a second benefit fund for miners who retired between july  and september  and whose former employers are no longer in business 
upon the consummation of the business combination with anker  we assumed anker s coal act liabilities  which were estimated to be million at december  prior to the business combination with anker  we did not have any liability under the coal act 

table of contents income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance  if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  we take into account various factors including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
if future taxable income is lower than expected or if expected tax planning strategies are not available as anticipated  we may record a change to the valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period the determination is made 
goodwill in our consolidated balance sheet as of december   we had million in goodwill  which represents the excess of costs over the fair value of the net assets acquired from horizon 
we test for impairment of goodwill annually as of october to determine if the fair value of the underlying business units can support the amount of goodwill allocated to them 
the goodwill tests include discounted cash flow models and a market valuation approach 
the discounted cash flow models include assumptions about future market conditions and operating results of the business units 
if an impairment test indicates the fair value of the underlying business units cannot support the amount of goodwill allocated to it  we will be required to write off the impaired portion 
as a result  the value of the assets could be significantly reduced  which would increase operating expenses and reduce net income for the year in which the write off occurs 
results of operations basis of presentation certain assets of horizon and its subsidiaries were acquired by icg  inc as of september  due to the change in ownership and the resultant application of purchase accounting  the historical financial statements of horizon and icg included in this report have been prepared on different bases for the periods presented and are not comparable 
the following provides a description of the basis of presentation during all periods presented successor we were formed on march   as a wholly owned subsidiary of icg  inc  in order to effect the corporate reorganization and the anker and coalquest acquisitions  all of which were consummated on november  financial presentation represents the consolidated financial position of international coal group  inc as of december  and consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the year then ended  the consolidated financial position of international coal group  inc as of december  and consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the period from november through december  combined with the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of icg  inc for the period from january through november   and the consolidated financial position of icg  inc as of december  and consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the period from may inception through december  icg  inc had no material assets  liabilities or results of operations until the acquisition of certain assets from horizon as of september  icg  inc s consolidated financial position at december  and its consolidated results of operations for the period ended december  reflect the purchase price allocation based on estimated fair values and actuarially determined employee benefit valuations 
the application of purchase accounting to the acquired assets of horizon resulted in increases to coal inventories and the asset arising from recognition of asset retirement obligations 
it also resulted in increases to plant and equipment  coal supply agreements and goodwill and a decrease in deferred taxes 
predecessors represents the consolidated financial position and results of operations and cash flows for horizon for the period january through september  the horizon accounts receivable  advance 
table of contents royalties  accounts payable and accrued expenses  intangibles  goodwill and other assets and long term liabilities were estimates of management 
the horizon property  plant and equipment  coal lands and accrued reclamation obligations were based on estimated fair values while employee benefit valuations were actuarially determined 
management allocated amounts of the purchase price to these assets and liabilities based on these estimates 
the financial statements for the predecessor periods of horizon have been prepared on a carve out basis to include our assets  liabilities and results of operations that were previously included in the consolidated financial statements of horizon

twelve months ended december  compared to the twelve months ended december  our results of operations for the twelve months ended december  and the period november  through december  include anker and coalquest 
revenues the following table depicts revenues for the years ended december  and for the indicated categories year ended december  increase decrease in thousands  except percentages and per ton data coal sales revenues freight and handling revenues other revenues total revenues tons sold coal revenue per ton coal sales revenues 
coal sales revenues increased million for the year ended december   or  compared to the year ended december  this increase was due to an increase in tons sold of over because of the anker coalquest acquisition and an increase of per ton increase in the average sales price of our coal exclusive of amortization income on below market coal supply agreements primarily sold pursuant to coal supply agreements 
tons sold in increased by million to million  primarily due to the effect of the anker and coalquest acquisitions  which provided approximately million additional tons over the prior year 
additionally  new mining complexes that commenced operations during provided an increase of approximately million tons over these increases were partially offset by decreases in tons sold caused by unusual events at our sago and viper mines and operating difficulties leading to the idling of certain mining units during the second half of freight and handling revenues 
freight and handling revenues increased million to million for year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase is due to an increase in shipments for which we initially pay the freight and handling costs and are then reimbursed by the customer 
other revenues 
other revenues increased for the year ended december  by million  or  to million  as compared to the year ended december  the increase was due to a gain of 
table of contents million related to the termination of a contractual coal delivery obligation  as well as increases of million in processing revenue being performed in a preparation plant obtained in the anker acquisition  million generated from newly developed coalbed methane wells owned jointly by our subsidiary  coalquest  and cdx gas  llc cdx  million in royalty revenues primarily related to an increase in mining activities from our sublessors and the finalization of sublesaing agreements  million in ash disposal revenue resulting from long term ash disposal contracts assumed as part of the anker acquisition and relating to a negotiated cash payment to us relating to a customer s tax credit pursuant to the state of maryland s mined coal tax credit provision 
the increases were partially offset by lower revenue of million from our highwall mining activities and shop services  both performed by our subsidiary icg addcar  due to decreased production caused by varying mining conditions at the contracting parties mining complexes

cost of coal sales and other revenues 
for the year ended december   our cost of coal sales increased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cost of coal sales was primarily a result of our acquisitions of anker and coalquest  which resulted in an increase in cost of coal sales of approximately million  and includes several unusual events and operating difficulties adversely affecting the year  such as the closure of the stony river deep mine  the bankruptcy of a key coal supplier for our vindex operation  an extended construction outage at the sentinel mine  adverse geological conditions encountered at the sycamore no 
mine and the effects of the sago mine accident in january our performance was also adversely affected in the second quarter of by a fire at our illinois mining complex 
the start up of our flint ridge  east mac and nellie  raven  crown  carlos and imperial mine sites  as well as the purchase of our jackson mountain mine site  increased cost of coal sales by million 
other factors affecting cost of coal sales and other revenues for the year were increases in prices for diesel fuel and lube costs of million  increased blasting supplies costs of million  increased contract labor costs of million and increased tire costs of million 
variable sales related costs  such as royalties and severance taxes increased million due to increased sales realization 
trucking costs increased million due to escalated diesel fuel costs 
in addition  salary and hourly payroll expense and related employee benefits increased million due to increased personnel and the necessity to maintain a competitive compensation program due to a highly competitive labor market 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in stockpile inventories which decreased cost of coal sales for the period by million  decreases in 
table of contents equipment rental expense of million due to the decision to purchase rather than lease needed equipment  decreased insurance costs of million primarily caused by the change from a state run workers compensation program to a private insurance carrier and a decrease in purchase coal costs of million 
costs of coal sales for the year includes million relating to the sago mine accident  including reserves established for claims and other future costs and million of carrying costs related to the mining operation prior to resuming operations at the end of the first quarter 
freight and handling costs 
freight and handling costs increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase is due to an increase in shipments for which we initially pay the freight and handling costs and are then reimbursed by the customer 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  depreciation  depletion and amortization per ton increased to per ton sold in the year ended december  from per ton sold for the year ended december  the principal component of the increase was an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of million for the year ended december   million of which was related to the acquisitions of anker and coalquest  as well as an increase in capital expenditures 
depletion of coalbed methane well costs resulted in an additional increase of million 
the increases were offset by an increase in amortization income on below market coal supply agreements of million during the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the net increase of million was attributable to gifts aggregating million made to the families of the thirteen miners involved in the sago mine accident  increases in legal  professional and consulting fees of million  million for share based compensation related restricted stock and stock options  million in compensation expense and million in insurance expense 
increases in legal  professional and consulting fees  as well as compensation and insurance expense  were related to being a public company 
these increases were offset by a million reduction in payroll taxes related to stock based compensation 
in  certain recipients of restricted stock awards filed section b elections  which resulted in full taxation of the award at the grant date rather than upon vesting 
gain on sale of assets 
asset sales resulted in a gain of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  total costs as a percentage of revenues 
total costs as a percentage of revenues increased to approximately for the year ended december  from for the year ended december   primarily as a result of weak coal prices in the second half of  unanticipated operating difficulties at certain mine locations  mine accidents at two locations and increased operating costs 
the softening of the coal market in the second half of caused a decrease in our profit margin earned on spot coal sales 
unanticipated adverse operating conditions experienced at the stony river deep mine  sentinel mine and sycamore no 
resulted in increased operating expenses with a reduced amount or no corresponding production for the year 
due to the sago mine accident as well as the mine fire at our illinois mining complex we experienced production interruptions that decreased sales while still incurring holding costs as the mines were being repaired 
profit margins were further squeezed at all locations compared to the prior year by increased employee compensation as well as increased prices of operating parts  supplies and services as discussed above 
twelve months ended december  compared to the twelve months ended december  of international coal group  inc and predecessor combined this discussion of the results of operations for the twelve months ended december  represents an addition of horizon s actual results for the nine months ended september  together with international coal group  inc s actual results of operations for the three months ended december  combined

cost of coal sales and other revenues 
in  our cost of coal sales increased million  or  to million compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in cost of coal sales is primarily a result of increases in prices for steel related mine supplies  including increases in costs for roof control supplies of million  increasing costs for conveyor belts and structure of million  escalating diesel fuel costs  which were further heightened by hurricane katrina s devastation in mississippi and louisiana of million  increasing costs for repairs and maintenance of million  increasing site preparation and maintenance of million and increasing purchase coal costs of million 
variable sales related costs  such as royalties and severance taxes  increased million due to increased sales realizations 
trucking costs increased million due to both escalating diesel fuel costs and increased driver compensation costs 
in addition  salary and hourly payroll expense increased million due to a highly competitive labor market and the necessity to maintain a competitive compensation program 
approximately million of the increase in the cost of coal sales was due to our acquisitions of anker and coalquest 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in equipment rental expense of million due to the decision to purchase rather than lease to fulfill our equipment needs 
the total costs and expenses per ton sold increased from per ton in to per ton in freight and handling costs 
freight and handling costs increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to the increase is due to an increase in shipments for which we initially pay the freight and handling costs and are then reimbursed by the customer 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased million to million in compared to million in depreciation  depletion and amortization per ton increased from per ton sold in to per ton sold in the principal component of the increase was an increase in depreciation expense of million in due to an increase in capital expenditures  as well as shortened depreciable asset lives of the horizon equipment purchased by icg  inc in september the cost increase was offset by a decrease in depletion of million as a result of a revaluation of mineral reserves in connection with the purchase of horizon s assets and amortization income on below market coal supply agreements of million 
effective january   horizon discontinued the accounting practice of capitalization of major repair costs in excess of  per occurrence 
the decrease in amortization relating to this practice was million 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for were million compared to million for the increase of million is primarily attributable to increases in stock compensation expense and related payroll taxes of million  administrative fees of million  bonuses of million and other costs of million 
gain on sale of assets 
gain on sale of assets increased million from a gain of million in to a gain of million in writedowns and other items 
the writedowns and other items were attributable to a loss of million on the sale of coal lands  a gain of million on a lease buyout  a loss on the retirement of a highwall mining system of million and other gains of million 
we did not record any writedowns in total costs as a percentage of revenues 
total costs and expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  
table of contents liquidity and capital resources our business is capital intensive and requires substantial capital expenditures for  among other things  purchasing  upgrading and maintaining equipment used in developing and mining our coal lands  as well as remaining in compliance with environmental laws and regulations 
our principal liquidity requirements are to finance our coal production  fund capital expenditures and service our debt and reclamation obligations 
we may also engage in acquisitions from time to time 
our primary sources of liquidity to meet these needs are cash flow from coal sales  other income  borrowings under our amended and restated credit facility and capital equipment finance arrangements 
we believe the principal indicators of our liquidity are our cash position and remaining availability under our amended and restated credit facility 
as of december   our available liquidity was million  including cash of million and million available under our amended and restated credit facility 
total debt represented of our total capitalization at december  our total capitalization represents our current short and long term debt combined with our total stockholders equity 
cash paid for capital expenditures was approximately million in and we currently expect our total capital expenditures will be approximately million in  of which represents investments in new equipment and mining development operations 
we have historically funded capital expenditures  and will fund future capital expenditures  from our internal operations  proceeds from our senior notes offering  borrowings under our amended and restated credit facility and our million equipment revolving credit facility with caterpillar financial services corporation 
we entered into the amended and restated credit facility in june and we expect that it will be sufficient to fund our anticipated capital expenditures under our current budget plan through our amended and restated credit agreement was further amended in january to modify certain financial covenants  which we expect will give us increased flexibility in facilitating our growth strategy 
as a result of recent accidents in the mining industry  new legislation has been announced that will require additional capital expenditures to meet enhanced safety standards 
for the year ended december   we spent million to meet these standards and anticipate spending an additional million in as we take advantage of planned expansion opportunities in and  principally as a result of the anker and coalquest acquisitions  we expect to spend approximately million on capital expenditures 
this estimate is based on our revised development plans which reflect the delayed development of certain new operations 
however  our capital expenditures may be different than currently anticipated depending upon the size and nature of new business opportunities and actual cash flows generated by our operations 
we continue to be affected by increased costs for mine supplies  services  repair parts  tires and fuel 
our results were adversely impacted by the continued rising prices of crude oil and natural gas  as well as increased labor costs 
we are exploring a range of options to try to address these issues 
in addition  as a result of infrastructure weaknesses and short term geologic issues at mines acquired in the anker acquisition  the transition period for implementation of various operational improvements has taken longer than originally anticipated 
on january   an explosion occurred at our sago mine in tallmansville  west virginia 
the sago mine is operated by our subsidiary wolf run mining company f k a anker west virginia mining company  inc 
costs incurred related to the sago mine accident totaled million  including reserves established for legal and other future costs and million of carrying costs related to the mining operation prior to resuming operations at the end of the first quarter 
on april   we suffered a fire at our viper mine near elkhart  illinois  that idled the mine and forced replacement of its high angle conveyor belt 
repairs have been completed and we resumed production on may  force majeure notices were issued to affected customers  but coal continued to be shipped from existing inventory through may  no one was injured in the incident 
we spent million to replace fully depreciated fixed assets damaged in the fire and incurred an estimated million in carrying costs while the mine was idle 

table of contents during  we experienced additional operating issues that have had a negative impact on our outlook 
the closure of vindex energy s stony river mine became permanent after a major roof fall in early february prevented access to the remaining coal reserves 
mining activity at wolf run s sycamore no 
mine suffered adverse geological conditions  which resulted in high production costs and reduced tonnage 
as a result of high production costs  we implemented production cutbacks at the sycamore no 
mine  as well as other operations  that total approximately million annual tons 
our east kentucky operation experienced rail service delays that resulted in our missing four trains and decreasing revenues by approximately million 
similar delays may or may not occur in the future 
our performance in was also adversely affected by the bankruptcy of a key coal supplier for our vindex operations and the ongoing effects of the sago mine accident 
we had brokered coal contracts that expired at the end of these contracts were signed during a period of oversupply in the coal industry and contained pricing that  while acceptable to the sellers at that time  were significantly below today s market levels 
the loss of these contracts will impact our earnings beginning in for the year ended december   these contracts provided million in pre tax net income 
however  the loss of this revenue is expected to be mitigated somewhat as additional owned and controlled mining complexes are brought into production in for example  in the fourth quarter of we commenced operations at our raven and philippi complexes and entered into a number of long term contracts with a key customer 
specifically  on october   our new raven complex commenced operations at its new preparation plant 
the mine is expected to reach full production by the end of and is expected to produce million tons of high quality steam coal annually for the southeastern utility market 
during the fourth quarter of  we were also able to resume production at the sentinel mine in our philippi complex after we extended the mine shafts and slope access to encounter more favorable mining conditions in the recently acquired clarion seam reserves 
we expect this mine to produce over million tons of high volatile metallurgical and high quality steam coal annually 
during the fourth quarter of  we also reached agreement on six new long term steam coal contracts and agreed to extend three central appalachian contracts with a key customer 
the agreements include a collared price feature that protects both icg and the customer 
in addition  production related to our coalbed methane joint operating agreement increased significantly during the fourth quarter of and provided coalbed methane and royalty revenue totaling million for we expect revenue related to this agreement to increase in due to a full year of operations and additional investments 
our new icg beckley complex is projected to begin production in the third quarter of the complex is expected to produce million tons of high quality  low volatile metallurgical coal annually for both domestic and export steel markets 
cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million from this decrease is attributable to a decrease in earnings of million  after adjustment for non cash charges 
the remaining decrease was due to the decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of million 
net income decreased in compared to primarily as a result of higher operating costs  most notably diesel fuel  trucking costs due to increased diesel costs  blasting supplies  roof bolts and plates  the effects of the sago mine accident  the effects of the viper mine fire  labor costs due to the highly competitive labor market and other operating issues noted above 
also impacting the comparability of net income for compared with was the acquisition of anker and coalquest in november for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was million compared to cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  cash used in investing activities for was million to replace our aged mining equipment fleet and expand operations compared to million in cash was returned from deposits of collateral for reclamation and royalty

simultaneous with the senior notes offering  our credit facility was amended and restated resulting in an increased credit facility of up to million

net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   an increase of million from the same period in this increase is attributable to an increase in net income of million after adjustment for non cash charges 
these increases were partially offset by the effects of a decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of million and writedowns of million 
in the same period in  there was a gain on a lease buyout option of million related to our predecessor s bankruptcy filing 
net income increased in primarily as a result of higher realization due to the strengthening of the coal market during the period 
the increase in realization was partially offset by higher operating costs most notably diesel fuel  trucking costs due to increased diesel costs and increased driver compensation and labor costs due to the highly competitive labor market 
higher interest expense for the predecessor company also impacted net income in for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was million compared to cash used in investing activities of million for the twelve months ended december  cash used in investing activities for was million in order to begin replacement of our aged mining equipment fleet compared to million in cash was returned from deposits of restricted cash used for collateral for reclamation and royalty bonds of million in compared to cash deposited of million in the same period of proceeds of equipment sales were million in compared to million in the same period of and proceeds from lease buyouts of million in had a positive impact on investing in investment activities also includes cash paid net of cash acquired of million related to the acquisition of anker and coalquest in through the issuance of  million shares of common stock

prior to the public offering  we made term loan payments of million and borrowed an additional million to consummate the mergers with anker and coalquest 
also impacting our financing activities was financing costs of million  capital lease payments of million and proceeds of million related to issuance of common stock to employees 
in addition  we borrowed million on our revolving credit facility to satisfy short term operational needs and made net repayments of million and million on our long term and short term debt  respectively

table of contents credit facility and long term debt obligations as of december   our total long term indebtedness  including capital lease obligations  consisted of the following december  senior notes  due equipment notes capital leases total less current portion long term debt senior notes 
on june   we sold million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due july  in a private placement pursuant to rule a of the securities act  as amended  and regulation s of the securities act  with net proceeds of approximately million to us after deducting fees and other offering expenses

at any time before july   we may also redeem up to of the aggregate principal amount of the notes at a redemption price of of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the date of redemption  with the proceeds of certain equity offerings 
upon a change of control  we may be required to offer to purchase the notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
on october   we commenced an exchange offer pursuant to a registration rights agreement with the initial purchasers to enable holders to exchange the privately placed notes for publicly registered notes 
the exchange offer expired on november  with of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes being tendered for exchange 
the terms of the exchange notes are identical to the terms of the original notes for which they were being exchanged  except that the registration rights and the transfer restrictions applicable to the original notes are not applicable to the exchange notes 
the indenture governing the notes contains covenants that limit our ability to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness  issue preferred stock  pay dividends  repurchase  repay or redeem our capital stock  make certain investments  sell assets and incur liens 
as of december   we were in compliance with our covenants under the indenture 
credit facility 
on june   we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement consisting of a revolving credit facility of million  of which up to a maximum of million may be used for letters of credit  and matures on june  as of december   we had letters of credit totaling million 
table of contents outstanding leaving million available for future borrowing capacity

other as a regular part of our business  we review opportunities for  and engage in discussions and negotiations concerning  the acquisition of coal mining assets and interests in coal mining companies  and acquisitions of  or combinations with  coal mining companies 
when we believe that these opportunities are consistent with our growth plans and our acquisition criteria  we will make bids or proposals and or enter into letters of intent and other similar agreements  which may be binding or nonbinding  that are customarily subject to a variety of conditions and usually permit us to terminate the discussions and any related agreement if  among other things  we are not satisfied with the results of our due diligence investigation 
any acquisition opportunities we pursue could materially affect our liquidity and capital resources and may require us to incur indebtedness  seek equity capital or both 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
additionally  we have other long term liabilities  including  but not limited to  mine reclamation and mine closure costs  below market coal supply agreements and black lung costs  and some of our subsidiaries have long term liabilities relating to retiree health and other employee benefits 
our ability to meet our long term debt obligations will depend upon our future performance  which in turn  will depend upon general economic  financial and business conditions  along with competition  legislation and regulation factors that are largely beyond our control 
based upon our current operations  the historical results of our predecessors  as well as those of anker and coalquest  we believe that cash flow from operations  together with other available sources of funds  including additional borrowings under our credit facility  will be adequate for at least the next months for making required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness and for funding anticipated capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
however  we cannot assure you that our operating results  cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of our debt obligations in the future

see certain relationships and related party transactions 
we are also a party to an employment agreement with each of our president and chief executive officer and our senior vice president  general counsel and secretary 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements 
these arrangements include guarantees and financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds 
no liabilities related to these arrangements are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows to result from these off balance sheet arrangements 
federal and state laws require us to secure payment of certain long term obligations  such as mine closure and reclamation costs  federal and state workers compensation  coal leases and other obligations 
we typically secure these payment obligations by using surety bonds  an off balance sheet instrument 
the use of surety bonds is less expensive than posting an all cash bond or a bank letter of credit  either of which would require a greater use of our credit facility 
we then use bank letters of credit to secure our surety bonding obligations as a lower cost alternative than securing those bonds with cash 
we currently have a million committed bonding facility pursuant to which we are required to provide bank letters of credit in an amount up to of the aggregate bond liability 
recently  surety bond costs have increased  while the market terms of surety bonds have generally become less favorable 
to the extent that surety bonds become unavailable  we would seek to secure our reclamation obligations with letters of credit  cash deposits or other suitable forms of collateral 
as of december   we had outstanding surety bonds with third parties for post mining reclamation totaling million  plus million for miscellaneous purposes 
as of december    we maintained letters of credit totaling million to secure reclamation surety bonds and other obligations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk 
we manage our commodity price risk for coal sales through the use of long term coal supply agreements rather than through the use of derivative instruments 
as of december   we had sales commitments for of our planned production 
some of the products used in our mining activities  such as diesel fuel  are subject to price volatility 
through our suppliers  we utilize forward contracts to manage the exposure related to this volatility 
a hypothetical increase of per gallon for diesel fuel would have increased the pre tax loss for the year ended december  by million
