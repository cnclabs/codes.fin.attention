table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its results of operations  financial condition and liquidity are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on an ongoing basis  the company reviews its estimates to ensure that the estimates appropriately reflect changes in its business or as new information becomes available 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition sales are recognized in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as products are shipped to customers  net of an allowance for sales returns and sales programs 
the criteria for recognition of revenue are when persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists and both title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
sales returns are estimated based upon historical returns  current economic trends  changes in customer demands and sell through of products 
the company also records estimated reductions to revenue for sales programs such as incentive offerings 
sales program accruals are estimated based upon the attributes of the sales program  management s forecast of future product demand  and historical customer participation in similar programs 
if the actual costs of sales returns and sales programs significantly exceed the recorded estimated allowance  the company s sales would be significantly adversely affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the failure of its customers to make required payments 
an estimate of uncollectible amounts is made by management based upon historical bad debts  current customer receivable balances  age of customer receivable balances  the customer s financial condition and current economic trends  all of which are subject to change 
if the actual uncollected amounts significantly exceed the estimated allowance  the company s operating results would be significantly adversely affected 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
the inventory balance  which includes material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs  is recorded net of an estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory 
the estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory is based upon management s understanding of market conditions and forecasts of future product demand  all of which are subject to change 
if the actual amount of obsolete or unmarketable inventory significantly exceeds the estimated allowance  the company s operating results would be significantly adversely affected 
long lived assets in the normal course of business  the company acquires tangible and intangible assets 
the company periodically evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amount of its long lived assets including property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
table of contents the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
impairment is assessed when the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to be derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount 
impairments are recognized in income from operations 
the company uses its best judgment based on the most current facts and circumstances surrounding its business when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments  and the fair value of a potentially impaired asset 
changes in assumptions used could have a significant impact on the company s assessment of recoverability 
warranty the company has a stated two year warranty policy for its golf clubs  although the company s historical practice has been to honor warranty claims well after the two year stated warranty period 
the company s policy is to accrue the estimated cost of satisfying future warranty claims at the time the sale is recorded 
in estimating its future warranty obligations  the company considers various relevant factors  including the company s stated warranty policies and practices  the historical frequency of claims  and the cost to replace or repair its products under warranty 
if the number of actual warranty claims or the cost of satisfying warranty claims significantly exceeds the estimated warranty reserve  the company s cost of sales  gross profit and net income would be significantly adversely affected 
income taxes current income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable or receivable for the current year 
a deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the expected future consequences resulting from temporary differences in the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company provides a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
the company is required to file federal and state tax returns in the united states and various other tax returns in foreign jurisdictions 
the preparation of these tax returns requires the company to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions  which could affect the amount of tax paid by the company 
the company  in consultation with its tax advisors  bases its tax returns on interpretations that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the tax returns  however  are subject to routine reviews by the various taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which the company files its returns 
as part of these reviews  a taxing authority may disagree with respect to the interpretations the company used to calculate its tax liability and therefore require the company to pay additional taxes 
as required under applicable accounting rules  the company therefore accrues an amount for its estimate of additional tax liability  including interest and penalties  which the company could incur as a result of the ultimate resolution of disagreements with the various taxing authorities related to federal  state and international tax matters 
the tax contingency accrual is recorded as a component of the company s net income taxes payable receivable balance  which the company reviews and updates over time as more definitive information becomes available from taxing authorities  completion of tax audits  expiration of statute of limitations  or upon occurrence of other events

table of contents share based payments  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
the company uses the black scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of its stock options at the date of grant 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
the company s employee stock options  however  have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options 
for example  employee stock options are generally subject to vesting restrictions and are generally not transferable 
in addition  option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility  the expected life of an option and the number of awards ultimately expected to vest 
changes in subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates of an option 
furthermore  the estimated fair value of an option does not necessarily represent the value that will ultimately be realized by an employee 
the company uses historical data to estimate the expected price volatility  the expected option life and the expected forfeiture rate 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the option 
if actual results are not consistent with the company s assumptions and judgments used in estimating the key assumptions  the company may be required to increase or decrease compensation expense  which could be material to its results of operations 
in accordance with sfas r  the company records compensation expense for restricted stock awards based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant 
the estimated fair value is determined based on the closing price of the company s common stock on the award date multiplied by the number of awards expected to vest 
the number of awards expected to vest is based on the number of awards granted adjusted by estimated forfeiture rates 
the total compensation cost is then recognized ratably over the vesting period 
if actual forfeiture rates are not consistent with the company s estimates  the company may be required to increase or decrease compensation expenses in future periods 
during  the company granted performance units to certain employees under the company s equity incentive plan 
performance units are a form of share based award in which the number of shares ultimately received depends on the company s performance against specified performance targets over a three year period ending december  the estimated fair value of the performance units is determined based on the closing price of the company s common stock on the award date multiplied by the expected number of shares to be issued at the end of the performance period 
the compensation cost is then amortized straight line over the performance period 
the company uses forecasted performance metrics to estimate the number of shares that will ultimately be issued 
if actual results are not consistent with the company s assumptions and judgments used in estimating the forecasted metrics  the company may be required to increase or decrease compensation expense  which could be material to its results of operations
