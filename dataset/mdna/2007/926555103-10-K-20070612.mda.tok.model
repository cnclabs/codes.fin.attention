item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company is a worldwide leader in the manufacture and distribution of a wide range of display devices  encompassing  among others  entertainment  military  medical and simulation display solutions 
the company is comprised of two segments the manufacture and distribution of displays and display components display segment and the distribution of consumer electronic parts wholesale distribution segment 
the display segment is organized into four interrelated operations aggregated into one reportable segment pursuant to the aggregation criteria of sfas financial accounting standards board statement no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
monitor offers a wide range of crt  flat panel and projection display systems for use in training and simulation  military  medical and industrial applications 
data display crt offers a wide range of crts for use in data display screens  including computer terminal monitors and medical monitoring equipment 
entertainment crt offers a wide range of crts and projection tubes for television and home theater equipment 
component parts provides replacement electron guns and other components for crts primarily for servicing the company s internal needs 
during fiscal  management of the company focused key resources on strategic efforts to dispose of unprofitable operations while seeking acquisition opportunities that enhance the profitability and sales growth of the company s more profitable product lines 
in addition  the company continues to seek new products through acquisitions and internal development that complement existing profitable product lines 
challenges facing the company during these efforts include inventory management the company continually monitors historical sales trends as well as projected future needs to ensure adequate on hand supplies of inventory and to ensure against overstocking of slower moving  obsolete items 
certain of the company s divisions maintain significant inventories of crts and component parts in an effort to ensure its customers a reliable source of supply 
the company s inventory turnover averages over days  although in many cases the company would anticipate holding to days of inventory in the normal course of operations 
this level of inventory is higher than some of the company s competitors due to the fact that it sells a number of products representing older  or trailing edge  technology that may not be available from other sources 
the market for these trailing edge technology products is declining and  as manufacturers for these products discontinue production or exit the business  the company may make last time buys 
in the monitor operations of the company s business  the market for its products is characterized by fairly rapid change as a result of the development of new technologies  particularly in the flat panel display area 
if the company fails to anticipate the changing needs of its customers or accurately forecast their requirements  it may accumulate inventories of products which its customers no longer need and which the company will be unable to sell or return to 
table of contents its vendors 
because of this  the company s management monitors the adequacy of its inventory reserves regularly  and at february   believes its reserves to be adequate 
interest rate exposure the company had outstanding debt of approximately million as of february  which is subject to interest rate fluctuations by the company s lenders 
higher rates applied by the federal reserve board during fiscal have negatively affected the company s earnings and the potential for continued rate hikes may negatively impact the company s future earnings 
it is the intent of the company to continually monitor interest rates and consider converting portions of the company s debt from floating rates to fixed rates should conditions be favorable for such interest rate swaps or hedges 
operations the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  the percentages which selected items in the company s consolidated statements of operations bear to total revenues amounts in thousands see item business description of principal business and principal products for discussion about the company s products and divisions 
see also note segment information to the consolidated financial statements 
amount amount amount net sales display segment monitors data display crts entertainment crts component parts total display segment wholesale distribution segment costs and expenses cost of goods sold selling and delivery general and administrative income from operations interest expense other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income fiscal compared to fiscal 
table of contents net sales consolidated net sales decreased million or to million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal display segment sales decreased or million to million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal wholesale distribution segment sales increased or million from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the net decrease in display segment sales for fiscal is primarily attributed to declines in monitor  data display crt  entertainment crt and component parts sales  as compared to fiscal the monitor revenues declined million primarily due to the fulfillment of a military contract for replacement crts early in fiscal  which has not been renewed and reduced demand for new flight training systems for commercial and military flight training 
data display sales in fiscal benefited from a concentration of new orders for certain projection tubes as production transferred to the company s facilities from the original equipment manufacturer 
after this initial spike  sales of these projection tubes leveled off at lower  but steady levels  resulting in a reduction in sales for fiscal entertainment crt net sales declined million in fiscal compared to fiscal a significant portion of the entertainment division s sales are to major television retailers as replacements for products sold under manufacturer and extended warranties 
due to continued lower retail sales prices for mid size television sets  fewer extended warranties were sold by retailers  a trend consistent with recent prior fiscal years 
the company remains the primary supplier of product to meet manufacturers standard warranties 
future sales trends in this division will be negatively impacted by the decreasing number of extended warranties sold for larger  more expensive sets 
because the company is in the replacement market  it has the ability to track retail sales trends and  accordingly  can attempt to adjust quantities of certain size crts carried in stock and reduce exposure to obsolescence 
components parts sales declined million from fiscal to fiscal component parts sales have generally declined in recent years due to weaker demand for electron gun and stem sales 
component parts sales have historically been dependent upon the demand by domestic and foreign television crt remanufacturers 
these sales have declined over the past few years as consumers move towards purchasing new technology as opposed to repairing existing sets 
wholesale distribution segment net sales growth is attributed to an expansion of the call center in fiscal  which acts as a consumer and dealer support center for in warranty and out of warranty household products  appliances  parts and accessories for black decker  delonghi  norelco  coby and various other manufacturers 
this call center also acts as a technical support center for these same manufacturers 
gross margins consolidated gross margins increased to for fiscal from for fiscal display segment margins increased from for fiscal to for fiscal gross margins within the monitor operation increased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to continued streamlining of operational facilities and cost reduction efforts as well as the one time impact of certain relocation and integration costs incurred in fiscal data display crt gross margins increased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal this improvement in margins is primarily attributed to improved selling prices of certain crt products with limited availability and reduced costs through transition to internal manufacturing of certain high resolution projection tubes 
gross margins in entertainment crts decreased from for fiscal to for fiscal due to the impact of the reduced sales volume 
gross margins from component parts increased to for fiscal from a negative margin of for fiscal  primarily reflecting the disposal of the unprofitable wintron facility in may 
table of contents the wholesale distribution segment gross margins decreased from for fiscal to for fiscal  primarily due to the impact of increased sales volume of lower margin call center service sales during fiscal expenses for the call center are classified as operating expenses 
operating expenses operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased from for fiscal to for fiscal primarily reflecting the impact of reduced sales during fiscal display segment operating expenses decreased million or to million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal this reduction is primarily due to cost savings derived from management s efforts to consolidate facilities  reduce overhead personnel and disposal of unprofitable operations  and decreases in corporate legal and professional fees 
wholesale distribution segment operating expenses increased million or to million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal  primarily due to additional expenses associated with the call center which was expanded late in fiscal these expenses primarily payroll are classified in general and administrative expense in the consolidated financial statements 
interest expense interest expense increased million or to million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal the company maintains various debt agreements with different interest rates  most of which are based on the prime rate or libor 
these increases in interest expense primarily reflect a higher proportion of subordinated debt  which has a higher effective interest rate  and higher market interest rates in effect during fiscal compared to fiscal income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to for fiscal  reflecting the impact of an increase in permanent differences in taxable income and foreign taxes 
foreign currency translation gains or losses resulting from the transactions with the company s uk subsidiary are reported in current operations while currency translation adjustments are recognized in a separate component of shareholders equity 
there were no significant gains or losses recognized in either period related to the uk subsidiary 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales consolidated net sales increased million for fiscal or compared to fiscal net sales 
this includes a display segment sales increase of million or and a wholesale distribution segment sales increase of million or for the comparative periods 
the net increase in display segment sales in fiscal represents a million decline in monitor sales  a million decline in entertainment crt sales and a million decline in component part sales  offset by an increase in data display crt sales of million compared to fiscal decreases in monitor sales primarily reflect a reduction in crt and dvst sales at lexel  teltron and xkd of million during fiscal compared to fiscal as contracts were fulfilled  but have not been replaced 
the timing of orders for these contracts  many of which are military related  are 
table of contents affected by a number of factors  including competitive bidding  government budgetary issues  the phase out and replacement of military field units and the life cycle of individual display units 
sales of other crt products from lexel are supported by a backlog of million at february  during fiscal  the teltron and xkd operations were consolidated with the aydin displays operation 
the crt related portion of aydin displays was further consolidated into the lexel operation during fiscal this decrease in crt and dvst sales was partially offset by a net increase in sales of flat panel and projector display units at display systems and aydin displays of million during fiscal  compared to fiscal  through contracts with boeing co  lockheed martin and various other customers 
increases in data display crt sales are attributed primarily to management s decision in fiscal to begin distributing commercial and military projection tube displays from its data display crt location in tucker  georgia 
these projection tube displays carry a higher sales price per unit than the units historically distributed from this facility 
the decline in entertainment crt sales reflects management s decision in late fiscal to move the distribution of projection tube displays from the novatron operation to its data display distribution facility  which is a part of the data display crt operation  and reduced sales at the novatron and chroma operations due to weaker demand in the television tube replacement market 
during fiscal  the magnaview operation was relocated and merged into the chroma facility 
the company is the primary supplier of replacement television crts to the domestic entertainment market 
a significant portion of the entertainment division s sales are to major television retailers as replacements for products sold under manufacturer and extended warranties 
due to continued lower retail sales prices for mid size television sets  fewer extended warranties were sold by retailers  a trend consistent with recent prior fiscal years 
the company remains the primary supplier of product to meet manufacturers standard warranties 
growth in this division will be negatively impacted by the decreasing number of extended warranties sold for the larger  more expensive sets 
the decline in component part sales reflects weaker demand for electron gun and stem sales at the southwest vacuum and wintron operations 
electron gun sales have historically been dependent upon the demand by domestic and foreign television crt remanufacturers 
these sales have declined over the past few years as consumers move towards purchasing new technology as opposed to repairing existing sets 
the company s wintron location is continuing its transition  focusing growth efforts on the distribution of two newer camera technologies  which is expected to reduce dependence on sales of components for crts 
one such technology will assist border guards with under car inspections and another will assist correctional facilities with the supervision of inmates 
if successful  the company believes these new technologies will have a positive impact on the component part sales 
the modest increase in wholesale distribution segment sales are attributed to growth in call center sales 
the call center operations of fox international were relocated and expanded during fiscal to provide the capacity to seek additional call center business in future periods 
gross margins consolidated gross profit margins declined from for the year ended february  to for the fiscal year ended february  display segment margins decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the wholesale distribution segment margins before call center expenses improved from for the year ended february  to for the year ended february  
table of contents within the display segment  monitor gross margins decreased from for fiscal to for fiscal this decrease is primarily attributed to higher than anticipated costs to complete certain product contracts acquired in the three five acquisition as specified in the management discussion section below  costs to relocate and combine the xkd operation into aydin displays  and lower margins generated and lower absorption of fixed overhead costs in the lexel and teltron operations at their reduced level of sales 
data display crt gross margins decreased from for fiscal to for fiscal  due to price competition and reduced demand for non projection crt tubes and an increase in the provision for obsolete inventory over the prior year 
gross margins in entertainment crts decreased from for fiscal to for fiscal due to lower absorption of fixed overhead costs at their reduced level of sales 
gross margins from component parts sold also decreased from for fiscal to for fiscal due to the impact of lower sales volume and charges for inventory obsolescence 
operating expenses consolidated operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased from for fiscal to for fiscal display segment operating expenses increased million or during fiscal compared to fiscal  while operating expenses for the wholesale distribution segment increased million or for the comparable periods 
within the display segment  which includes the majority of corporate level expenses for the consolidated group  the increase is primarily due to increased accounting and legal fees associated with financial regulatory reporting and work on potential acquisition projects  which have subsequently been abandoned 
wholesale distribution segment operating expenses increased due to added labor and overhead costs associated with the expansion of the call center in the second half of fiscal sales growth for services provided by the expanded call center was slower than anticipated  consequently staffing was reduced near the end of fiscal to correspond with projected near term call center needs and reduce operating costs 
interest expense interest expense increased million or for fiscal as compared to fiscal  due to a higher level of average outstanding borrowings and higher market interest rates 
the company maintains various debt agreements with variable interest rates  most of which are based on libor or the prime rate 
income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to for fiscal  reflecting the impact of an increase in permanent differences in taxable income at the lower level of earnings 
management s discussion of liquidity and capital resources at february  and february   the company had total cash of million and million  respectively 
the company s working capital was million and million at february  and february   respectively 
at february  the company s million in outstanding lines of credit were classified as short term debt and were refinanced during fiscal  as discussed later in this section 
in recent years  the company has financed its growth and cash needs primarily through income from operations  borrowings under revolving credit facilities  borrowings from its ceo and long term debt 

table of contents the company specializes in certain products representing trailing edge technology that may not be available from other sources  and may not be currently manufactured 
in many instances  the company s products are components of larger display systems for which immediate availability is critical for the customer 
accordingly  the company enjoys higher gross margins  but typically has larger investments in inventories than those of its competitors 
the company continually monitors its cash and financing positions in order to find ways to lower its interest costs and to produce positive operating cash flow 
the company examines possibilities to grow its business through internal sales growth or niche acquisitions 
there could be an impact on working capital requirements to fund this growth 
as in the past  the intent is to finance such projects with operating cash flows or existing bank lines  however  more permanent sources of capital may be required in certain circumstances 
cash provided by operations was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal during fiscal  net working capital  excluding acquisitions  increased million due to a million increase in accounts receivable  a million decrease in inventory  a million increase in cost  estimated earnings and billings  net  on uncompleted contacts  a decrease of million in refundable income taxes and a decrease in short term lines of credit  mainly due to the refinancing of those lines  of million 
the increase in accounts receivable resulted from the timing of sales near the end of the fiscal year 
the overall aging of accounts receivable improved slightly at february  compared to the prior fiscal year end 
the reduction in inventory is primarily due to a reduction in bulk purchases of last time buys of crts as the company anticipates a trend of reduced demand for these products in the replacement market 
after refinancing during fiscal  the lines of credit are now classified as long term liabilities 
net working capital  excluding acquisitions  decreased million in fiscal  due to a million increase in inventory and an increase of million in refundable income taxes  a decline of million in accounts receivable and an increase in short term lines of credit of million  which  as discussed  were refinanced during fiscal the increase in inventory primarily related to increased inventory in the wholesale distribution segment and increased projection tube inventory in the monitor operations

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements 
these financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes 
the accounting policies that may involve a higher degree of judgments  estimates  and complexity include reserves on inventories  the allowance for bad debts  contract revenue recognition as well as profitability or loss recognition estimates and warranty reserves 
the company uses the following methods and assumptions in determining its estimates reserves on inventories reserves on inventories result in a charge to operations when the estimated net realizable value declines below cost 
management regularly reviews the company s investment in inventories for declines in value and establishes reserves when it is apparent that the expected net realizable value of the inventory falls below its carrying amount 
management attempts to determine by historical usage analysis and interchangeability of crt types along with repair contracts currently maintained by its customers  as well as numerous other market factors  the projected demand for crts in this estimate of net realizable value 
management is able to identify consumer buying trends  such as size and application  well in advance of supplying replacement crts 
thus  the company is able to adjust inventory stocking levels according to the projected demand 
the average life of a crt is five to seven years  at which time the company s replacement market develops 
management reviews inventory levels on a quarterly basis 
such reviews include observations of product development trends of the oem s  new products being marketed and technological advances relative to the product capabilities of the company s existing inventories 
there have been no significant changes in management s estimates in fiscal and  however  the company cannot guarantee the accuracy of future forecasts since these estimates are subject to change based on market conditions 

table of contents during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  the company deducted inventory against the reserve for obsolescence in the amount of million  million and million  respectively 
the reserve for inventory obsolescence was approximately million and million at february  and february   respectively 
revenue and profit or loss recognition revenues are recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the price has been fixed or is determinable and collectibility can be reasonably assured 
the company s delivery term typically is fob shipping point 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs shipping and handling fees billed to customers are classified in net sales in the consolidated statements of operations 
shipping and handling costs incurred for the delivery of product to customers are classified in selling and delivery in the consolidated statements of operations 
a portion of the company s revenue is derived from contracts to manufacture crts to a buyer s specification 
these contracts are accounted for under the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
these contracts are fixed price and cost plus contracts and are recorded on the percentage of completion basis using the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs at completion as the measurement basis for progress toward completion and revenue recognition 
any losses identified on contracts are recognized immediately 
contract accounting requires significant judgment relative to assessing risks  estimating contract costs and making related assumptions for schedule and technical issues 
with respect to contract change orders  claims or similar items  judgment must be used in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
these amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is probable 
the wholesale distribution segment has several distribution agreements that it accounts for using the gross revenue basis as prescribed by eitf issue reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
the company uses the gross method because the company has general inventory risk  physical loss inventory risk and credit risk 
the call center service revenue is recognized based on written pricing agreements with each manufacturer  on a per call  per email or per standard mail basis 
allowance for bad debts the allowance for bad debts is determined by reviewing all accounts receivable and applying historical credit loss experience to the current receivable portfolio with consideration given to the current condition of the economy  assessment of the financial position of the creditors as well as payment history and overall trends in past due accounts compared to established thresholds 
the company monitors credit exposure and assesses the adequacy of the allowance for bad debts on a regular basis 
historically  the company s allowance has been sufficient for any customer write offs 
although the company cannot guarantee future results  management believes its policies and procedures relating to customer exposure are adequate 
warranty reserves the warranty reserve is determined by recording a specific reserve for known warranty issues and a reserve based on claims experience 
the company considers actual warranty claims compared to net sales  
table of contents then adjusts its reserve liability accordingly 
actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates  requiring adjustments to the reserve 
management feels that historically its procedures have been adequate and does not anticipate that its assumptions are reasonably likely to change in the future 
other loss contingencies other loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
disclosure is required when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded provision 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb ratified the consensus reached by the emerging issues task force in issue no 
eitf  how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation 
the scope of eitf includes any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue producing activity between a seller and a customer  and may include  but is not limited to  sales  use  value added  and some excise taxes 
eitf concluded that the presentation of taxes within its scope on either a gross included in revenue and cost or net excluded from revenues basis is an accounting policy decision subject to appropriate disclosure 
eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company currently presents these taxes on a net basis and therefore we do not anticipate the adoption of eitf will have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
interpretation no 
requires the use of a two step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosures regarding uncertainties in income tax positions 
only tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized upon adoption of interpretation no 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the cumulative effect of initially adopting interpretation no 
is to record an adjustment to opening retained earnings in the year of adoption and should be presented separately 
management is in the process of evaluating the provisions of the interpretation  but does not anticipate that the adoption will have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards statement no 
 fair value measurements 
statement no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the statement does not require new fair value measurements  but is applied to the extent that other accounting pronouncements require or permit fair value measurements 
the statement emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement that should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability 
companies will be required to disclose the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities  the inputs used to develop the measurements  and the effect of certain of the measurements on earnings or changes in net assets for the period 
management is in the process of assessing statement no 
 but does not anticipate that the adoption will have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r  which requires an employer to recognize the over funded or under funded status of a defined 
table of contents benefit postretirement plan other than a multiemployer plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income of a business entity or changes in unrestricted net assets of a not for profit organization 
statement no 
also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end statement of financial position  with limited exceptions 
this statement is effective for fiscal years ending after december  the company does not currently provide defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans  therefore management has determined that the adoption of this interpretation will not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in september  the staff of the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab requires that public companies utilize a dual balance sheet and income statement approach to assessing the quantitative effects of financial misstatements 
sab also addresses the mechanics of correcting misstatements that include the effects from prior years  and provides for error correction through a one time cumulative effect adjustment to beginning of year retained earnings upon initial adoption 
the guidance in sab must be applied to annual financial statements for fiscal years ending after november  the adoption of sab did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended february  in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities fas 
this standard allows companies to elect to apply fair value accounting for certain financial assets and liabilities 
fas is applicable only to certain financial instruments and is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company is currently evaluating the effect  if any  fas may have on its financial statements 
impact of inflation inflation has not had a material effect on the company s results of operations to date 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and variability in interest rate spread relationships  such as prime to libor spreads 
approximately million of outstanding debt at february  related to long term indebtedness under variable rate debt 
interest on the outstanding balance of this debt will be charged based on a variable rate related to the prime rate or the libor rate 
both rate bases are incremented for margins specified in their agreements 
thus  the company s interest rate is subject to market risk in the form of fluctuations in interest rates
