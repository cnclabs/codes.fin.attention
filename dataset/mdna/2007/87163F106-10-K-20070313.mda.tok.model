acquisitions on september   we acquired the wireless clearinghouse business of ios north america from eds 
we paid million on the date of the acquisition and an additional million in january resulting from the settlement of the final working capital adjustment pursuant to the purchase agreement 
we financed the acquisition through increased borrowings under our previous senior credit facility and available cash 
the primary services of ios north america include wireless voice and data clearinghouse services 
these post acquisition revenues are reported in technology interoperability services 

table of contents on june   we acquired the capital stock of perfect profits international ppil  which comprises the interactive technologies holdings limited business ithl  from interactive technologies holdings limited for million  in cash including preliminary working capital adjustments and earn out to sellers of approximately million 
in connection with the acquisition  we incurred million in acquisition related costs 
in addition  the purchase agreement contains certain earn out provisions  pursuant to which the sellers may receive up to million in additional cash consideration based upon achieving certain levels of revenues and ebitda 
headquartered in hong kong  ithl is a leading provider of value added services to carriers in the asia pacific region 
we believe the acquisition expands our footprint in the asia pacific region and adds a complementary customer base  new products  advanced development capabilities and in region customer support 
introduction we provide an integrated suite of services to wireless telecommunications carriers that meet the evolving technology requirements of the wireless industry 
these services include technology interoperability services 
we operate the largest wireless clearinghouse in the world that enables the accurate invoicing and settlement of domestic and international wireless roaming telephone calls and wireless data events 
we also provide sms and mms routing and translation services between carriers 
in addition  we provide mobile data solutions that include interactive video and mobile broadband solutions  prepaid applications and value added roaming services through our acquisition of ithl 
network services 
through our ss network  we connect disparate wireless carrier networks and enable access to intelligent network database services such as caller id and provide translation and routing services to support the delivery and establishment of telephone calls 
number portability services 
our number portability services are used by many wireless carriers  including the five largest domestic carriers  to enable wireless subscribers to switch service providers while keeping the same telephone number 
call processing services 
we provide wireless carriers global call handling and fraud management solutions that allow wireless subscribers from one carrier to make and accept telephone calls while roaming on another carrier s network 
enterprise solutions 
our enterprise wireless data management platform allows carriers to offer large corporate customers reporting and analysis tools to manage telecom related expenses 
off network database queries 
we provide our network customers with access to various third party intelligent network databases 
revenues most of our revenues are transaction based and derived from long term contracts  typically with terms averaging three years in duration 
most of the services and solutions we offer to our customers are based on applications  network connectivity and technology platforms owned and operated by us 
we also generate revenues through the sale of software licenses  hardware and professional services 
we generate our revenues through the sale of our technology interoperability services  network services  number portability services  call processing services and enterprise solutions to telecommunications carriers throughout the world 
in order to encourage higher customer transaction volumes  we generally negotiate tiered and flat rate pricing schedules with our customers based on certain established transaction volume levels 
as a result  the average per transaction fee for many of our products has declined over time as customers have increasingly used our services and transaction volumes have grown 
we expect this trend to continue 
generally  there is also a slight increase in wireless roaming telephone usage and corresponding revenues in the high travel months of the second and third fiscal quarters 

table of contents future increases or decreases in revenues are dependent on many factors  such as industry subscriber growth  with few of these factors known in advance 
from time to time  specific events such as customer contract renewals at different terms  a customer contract termination  a customer s decision to change technologies or to provide solutions in house  will be known to us and then we can estimate their impact on our revenues 
set forth below is a brief description of our primary service offerings and associated revenue recognition technology interoperability services 
we operate the largest wireless clearinghouse in the world that enables the accurate invoicing and settlement of domestic and international wireless roaming telephone calls and wireless data events 
we also provide sms and mms routing and translation services between carriers 
wireless carriers send data records to our service platforms for processing  aggregation  translation and distribution among carriers 
we primarily generate revenues by charging per transaction processing fees based on the number of data messaging records provided to us by wireless carriers for our wireless roaming clearinghouse and sms and mms routing services 
we recognize revenues at the time the transactions are processed 
over time  we expect the average per transaction fee for certain services to continue to decline as a result of our volume based and service bundling pricing strategy for most of our offerings as well as competitive pricing pressure 
with our acquisition of ithl  we provide mobile data solutions that include interactive video and mobile broadband solutions  prepaid applications and value added roaming services 
some of these solutions contain multiple product and service elements which may include software and hardware products  as well as installation services  post contract customer support and training 
in those cases  we recognize revenues in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
under sop  revenue attributable to an element in a customer arrangement is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
network services 
through our ss network  we connect disparate wireless carrier networks and enable access to intelligent network database services such as caller id 
we also provide translation and routing services to support the delivery and establishment of telephone calls 
ss is the telecommunications industry s standard network signaling protocol used by substantially all carriers to enable critical telecommunications functions such as line busy signals  toll free calling services and caller id 
we primarily generate revenues by charging either per transaction or fixed processing fees determined by expected customer volumes 
in addition  our customers pay monthly connection fees based on the number of network connections as well as the number of switches with which a customer communicates 
the per transaction fees are based on the number of intelligent network messages and intelligent network database queries made through our network and are recognized as revenues at the time the transactions are processed 
over time  we expect the average per transaction fee for certain services will continue to decline as a result of our volume based and service bundling pricing strategy and competitive pricing pressures 
number portability services 
we provide number portability services to the wireless industry 
when wireless subscribers choose to change carriers but keep their existing telephone number  the former carrier must send the subscribers information to the new carrier 
our services perform the necessary processing between the two carriers to allow the subscribers to change service providers while keeping their existing telephone number 
we primarily generate revenues by charging per transaction processing fees  monthly fixed fees and fees for customer implementations 
we recognize processing revenues at the time the transactions and services are processed 
we recognize monthly fixed fees as revenues on a monthly basis as the services are performed 
we defer revenues and incremental customer specific costs related to customer implementations and recognize these fees and costs on a straight line basis over the shorter of the life of the initial customer agreement or the period remaining until the amended contract end date for those contracts terminated early 
we expect number portability 
table of contents services revenues to decrease approximately in this decrease is attributable to contract renewals concluded in late and early  offset in part by expected revenues from new customers 
call processing services 
we provide wireless carriers global call handling and fraud management solutions that allow wireless subscribers from one carrier to make and accept calls while roaming on another carrier s network 
we primarily generate revenues by charging per transaction processing fees based on the number of validation  authorization and other call processing messages generated by wireless subscribers 
we recognize processing fee revenues at the time the transactions are processed 
we expect our call processing revenues will continue to decline due to the continued migration of customers off the fraud prevention services that are near the end of their life cycle 
enterprise solutions services 
our enterprise wireless data management platform allows carriers to offer large corporate customers reporting and analysis tools to manage telecom related expenses 
we primarily generate revenues by charging per subscriber fees 
we recognize these revenues at the time the service is performed 
we expect a gradual decline in these revenues as customers migrate off of our wireless data management platform 
off network database queries 
through interconnection with other carrier networks  we have access to other service providers databases that support caller id and toll free routing 
if one of our customers uses our network to access another service provider s database  we are charged fees for access to that database 
we pass these charges onto our customers  with little or no margin  based upon the charges we receive from these database providers 
we recognize revenues at the time the transaction is performed 
over time  these revenues are expected to continue to decline as customers seek direct connections with the database providers 
for more information about how we recognize revenues for each of our service categories  please see the discussion below under critical accounting policies and estimates 
costs and expenses our costs and expenses consist of cost of operations  sales and marketing  general and administrative and depreciation and amortization 
cost of operations includes data processing costs  network costs  royalty costs  hardware costs  personnel costs associated with service implementation  training and customer care and off network database query charges 
sales and marketing includes personnel costs  advertising costs  trade show costs and relationship marketing costs 
general and administrative consists primarily of research and development expenses  a portion of the expenses associated with our facilities  internal management expenses  business development expenses  and expenses for finance  legal  human resources and other administrative departments 
in addition  we incur significant service development costs 
these costs  which are primarily personnel  relate to technology creation  enhancement and maintenance of new and existing services 
historically  most of these costs are expensed and recorded as general and administrative expenses 
the capitalized portion  which is recorded as capitalized software costs  relates to costs incurred during the application development stage for the new service offerings and significant service enhancements 
depreciation and amortization relate primarily to our property and equipment including our ss network  infrastructure facilities related to information management and other intangible assets recorded in purchase accounting

table of contents decrease in revenues was primarily due to decreases in our number portability services due to the sprint migration of the number portability error resolution services and decreases in network services  enterprise solutions and off network database query fees  offset in part  by increases in technology interoperability services  which includes the addition of revenues from our acquisition of ithl  and call processing services 
technology interoperability services revenues increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the increase in revenues was primarily due to organic volume growth in our wireless clearinghouse services and sms services  and the addition of revenues from our acquisition of ithl  partially offset by a decline in revenues due to a competitive pricing environment and a decline in per transaction fees pursuant to our volume based and service bundling pricing strategy for certain services 
during the preparation of our annual financial statements  we discovered a customer billing error related to one of our services 
as a result  we determined that our revenues were overstated during the period from october to september by million  of which million related to the fourth quarter of we reviewed the impact of the error on the fourth quarter of and through the third quarter of and concluded that the cumulative impact of the error was not material to the previously reported quarters 
as a result  we have recorded the full amount of the error in the fourth quarter of network services revenues decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the decrease in revenues was primarily due to the migration off our services platform by some of our customers and price concessions commensurate with our volume based and service bundling pricing strategy for certain of our services and a competitive pricing environment 
in addition  two of our ss customers have substantially completed the process of replacing our ss network solution 
this replacement has resulted in the reduction of network services revenues by million 
we expect network services revenues to be at least million lower in compared to  given the impact of these two specific customer migrations and a continued competitive pricing environment 
number portability services revenues decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the decrease in revenues was primarily due to lower port center activity related to the sprint migration 
during the fourth quarter of  we received notice from sprint of its intention to move number portability error resolution services provided by us to its own internal platforms effective may  we continued to provide limited number portability error resolution services to sprint until december  in april  we signed a transitional support services agreement with sprint to assist in its migration of the number portability error resolution services to its internal platforms 
we accelerated the amortization of deferred sprint implementation fees and the associated deferred sprint implementation costs to fully amortize these ratably over the year ended december  we also amortized the transition fee over the fiscal year 
after  we no longer received revenues from sprint for these services 
we expect to continue providing sprint with number portability services other than number portability error resolution services 
the sprint migration reduced total revenues by million  excluding the effect of any new or expanded services 
we expect number portability services revenues to decrease approximately in this decrease is attributable to contract renewals concluded in late and early  offset in part by expected revenue from new customers 
call processing services revenues increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the increase in revenues was attributable to increased international roaming volumes driven by increased demand for our signaling solutions services  offset in part by a reduction of our traditional call processing solution 
we expect call processing services revenues to decrease approximately in this expected decrease is due to the continued migration of customers off the fraud prevention services that are near the end of their service life cycle 
enterprise solutions services revenues decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the decrease in revenues was primarily due to a lower number 
table of contents of subscribers on our enterprise wireless data management platform 
we expect a revenue decline of approximately the same amount in off network database queries revenues decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the decrease in revenues was primarily driven by customers moving to direct access and billing arrangements with third party intelligent network database providers 
we pass these off network database query fees onto our customers  with little or no margin  based upon the charges we receive from the third party database providers 
we expect this decline to continue 
expenses cost of operations increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the increase was primarily due to operational costs associated with our acquisition of ithl  partially offset by a decrease in operational costs related to our number porting services primarily due to the sprint migration and decreases in our off network database queries services 
sales and marketing expenses increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the increase is primarily due to sales and marketing expenses related to our acquisition of ithl  higher employee related costs for international expansion and increased trade show expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for this increase was primarily due to million related solely to the relocation of our corporate headquarters  including million associated with the early lease termination of our former corporate headquarters  million related to higher product development expenses  million in costs associated with our litigation settlements  expenses associated with our acquisition of ithl and expenses associated with operating as a public company 
depreciation and amortization expenses decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the decrease was primarily due to lower amortization of intangible assets associated with the verizon revenue guarantee agreement which expired in december and lower amortization expense related to a certain intangible asset associated with the ios north america customer base  offset in part by additional amortization of intangible assets from our acquisition of ithl 
included in our depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended december  and is approximately million and million  respectively  in amortization related to intangible assets recorded in purchase accounting due to our february acquisition from verizon  our december acquisition of syniverse holdings limited formerly softwright holdings  ltd  our september acquisition of ios north america and our june acquisition of ithl 
restructuring expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in february  we completed a restructuring plan in our marketing group resulting in the termination of eight employees 
as a result  we incurred million in severance related costs 
in august  we completed a restructuring plan in our operations and marketing groups  resulting in the termination of thirty employees 
as a result  we incurred million in severance related costs 
other interest income decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for primarily due to interest income earned on lower average cash balances 
interest expense decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the decrease was primarily a result of our recapitalization occurring in the first quarter of 
table of contents in connection with our initial public offering  which lowered our average outstanding debt balance and interest rate  and the refinancing of our remaining senior subordinated notes due in the third quarter of loss on extinguishment of debt was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in february  we redeemed all outstanding senior subordinated notes due resulting in a prepayment premium of million 
in february  we recognized million on the early extinguishment of debt related to our previous senior credit facility and the repurchase of million of our senior subordinated notes due the loss included a non cash write off of million of unamortized deferred financing costs and million of unamortized debt discount relating to the previous senior credit facility and the repurchased portion of the senior subordinated notes due  as well as a million cash charge related to the prepayment premium on the repurchased portion of the senior subordinated notes due in august  we recognized million on the early extinguishment of debt related to the tender of million of our senior subordinated notes due the loss includes a non cash write off of million of unamortized deferred financing costs and million of unamortized debt discount  as well as a million cash charge related to the prepayment premium and million of other costs 
other  net decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for  and is comprised of non operating revenues and gains from the sale of marketable securities 
provision for income taxes was million for the year ended december  benefit from income taxes was million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we reversed a significant portion of our net deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance  originally established in  and adjusted annually thereafter  was recorded because the realization of those deferred tax assets did not meet the more likely than not criteria under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
based upon an evaluation of our most recent seven quarters of profitability and our expectations of continued net income  a tax benefit for the deferred tax assets was recognized in the fourth quarter as we determined that we have met the more likely than not criteria related to those deferred tax assets 
the benefit reduced our estimated annual effective tax rate to approximately 
as of december   based upon our judgment  we will continue to maintain a valuation allowance for certain other deferred tax assets primarily associated with foreign and state net operating loss carry forwards and capital loss carry forwards 
preferred stock dividends were million for the year ended december  the undeclared and unpaid preferred dividends relate to the preferred yield on syniverse inc s class a cumulative redeemable convertible preferred stock issued on february  on february   we redeemed  shares of our class a cumulative redeemable convertible preferred stock  including accrued and unpaid dividends  at a liquidation value of million with proceeds received from our initial public offering 
on march   pursuant to the terms of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation  all of our outstanding shares of class a cumulative redeemable convertible preferred stock were converted into  shares of our common stock based upon the liquidation value plus accrued and unpaid dividends of the class a cumulative redeemable convertible preferred stock using the initial public offering price of per share

table of contents for the year ended december  the increase in revenues was primarily due to organic volume growth in technology interoperability services  the addition of ios north america results  growth in network services and number porting services revenues offset in part by decreases in call processing services and enterprise solutions services revenues 
during the fourth quarter of  we renewed our contract with verizon wireless 
consistent with our overall pricing strategy  the terms of the new contract reflect lower pricing that will  in the near term  reduce our revenues from this customer 
the impact was approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in over an extended time period  we believe these decreases will likely be offset in part by higher transaction volumes as well as additional service offerings to verizon wireless 
technology interoperability services revenues increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the increase in revenues was primarily due to organic volume growth in our wireless clearinghouse services and the acquisition of ios north america  partially offset by a decline in per transaction fees pursuant to our volume based pricing strategy for certain services and a competitive pricing environment

in addition  two of our ss customers announced that they intended to replace our ss network solution 
this replacement has resulted in the reduction of network services revenues by million 
number portability services revenues increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the increase in revenues was primarily due to higher porting activity 
during the fourth quarter of  we received notice from sprint of its intention to move number portability error resolution services provided by us to its own internal platforms effective may  however  we continued to provide limited number portability error resolution services to sprint until december  in april  we signed a transitional support services agreement with sprint to assist in their migration of the number portability error resolution services to their internal platforms 
we have accelerated the amortization of deferred sprint implementation fees and the associated deferred sprint implementation costs to fully amortize these over the year ended december  we also amortized the transition fee over the fiscal year 
based on this new agreement  the number portability revenues from sprint were relatively comparable to revenues  however  we will no longer have any revenues from sprint for these services in future years 
this decrease in revenues will be partially offset by decreased costs associated with providing these services 
we expect to continue providing sprint with number portability services other than number portability error resolution services 
the sprint migration reduced total revenues by million  excluding the effect of any new or expanded services 
call processing services revenues decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the decline in call processing revenues was attributable to technology developments that have resulted in traditional call processing functionality being incorporated into more cost effective ss network solutions 
this has resulted in customers increasingly moving from our call processing solution to our ss network  a competitor s ss network  in house ss networks and or direct connections with roaming partners

other  net was million for the year ended december  the gain is the result of the sale of marketable securities in the fourth quarter of provision for income taxes increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for our provision primarily represents the increase in deferred tax liabilities related to goodwill 
primarily as a result of our impairment loss in the fourth quarter of  we concluded that it was appropriate to establish a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets  excluding deferred tax liabilities related to goodwill 
we expect to continually evaluate this allowance and will reduce it as the utilization of these nols becomes more likely than not 
the deferred tax assets arise primarily from federal net operating losses  which expire between and these losses relate primarily to brience s operations in periods prior to february  in addition  because we do not amortize goodwill for financial reporting purposes and cannot predict if or when this deferred tax liability will be payable  we are unable to consider these goodwill related deferred tax liabilities at december  in this analysis of our valuation allowance

the credit agreement also requires compliance with several financial covenants  including a maximum ratio of total indebtedness to ebitda and a minimum ratio of ebitda to interest expense 
we used the million of borrowings under the new senior credit facility in combination with the net proceeds from our ipo to repay our previous senior credit facility  to pay related transaction fees and expenses and to effect a tender offer for million of our senior subordinated notes due previous senior credit facility in february  we entered into our previous senior credit facility  which provided for aggregate borrowings of up to million 
the facility was comprised of a revolving credit facility of up to million in revolving credit loans and letters of credit with the funds available for general corporate purposes including working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and a term b loan facility of million in term loans 
the revolving line of credit and the term note each bore interest at variable rates based on  at our option  libor or the greater of the prime rate and the weighted average of the rates on overnight federal funds transactions plus 
on september   we amended our previous senior credit facility to i increase the maximum consolidated leverage and consolidated senior debt ratios  ii reduce the minimum consolidated interest coverage ratios beginning with the third and fourth fiscal quarters of and the four fiscal quarters of  and beyond  and iii reduce the minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio 
in addition  the amendment increased the permitted level of capital expenditures for fiscal years and and clarified that the operations of syniverse brience for periods prior to its acquisition would not be included in the covenant calculation 
on march   we further amended our previous senior credit facility to i provide for the incurrence under the senior credit facility of new additional tranche b term loans  which refinanced  in full  all remaining outstanding tranche b term loans and ii reduce the percentage of excess cash flow which must be applied to prepay the loans to

as of december   we had an aggregate face amount of million of outstanding indebtedness under our previous senior credit facility representing the term b note facility  which bore interest at a variable weighted average rate of and had a final maturity of september  as of december   there was million available under the revolving credit facility  which had a final maturity of december  
table of contents on february   we refinanced our previous senior credit facility with a new million senior credit facility  which contains more favorable terms with respect to  among other things  interest rates and covenants 
senior subordinated notes due on february   we tendered for approximately million in aggregate principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due reducing the aggregate principal amount outstanding to million at that time 
in connection with the tender offer  we paid a premium of million  related fees of million and accrued interest of million 
in addition to the prepayment premium of million  the associated unamortized debt discount of million and deferred finance costs of million were recognized as loss on extinguishment of debt in the first quarter of on august   we tendered for approximately million in aggregate principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due  reducing the aggregate principal amount outstanding to million as of september  in connection with the tender offer  we paid a premium of million  related fees of million and accrued interest of million 
in addition to the prepayment premium of million  the associated unamortized debt discount of million and deferred finance costs of million were recognized as loss on extinguishment of debt in the third quarter of on february   we repurchased the remaining million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding senior subordinated notes due at a premium of million 
senior subordinated notes due on august   we completed a private offering of million in aggregate principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due interest on the notes accrues at the rate of per annum and is payable semi annually in arrears on february and august  commencing on february  the net proceeds were used to repurchase million of our outstanding senior subordinated notes due  and to pay the related prepayment premium and costs of debt issuance 
the remaining funds were held for the redemption of the million of senior subordinated notes due  not tendered in august  plus expected payment of related premium of approximately million 
the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes due contains certain covenants that among other things  limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock  pay dividends  make other restricted payments and investments  create liens  incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or other payments to them  sell assets  merge or consolidate with other entities  and enter into transactions with affiliates 
as of december   we believe we are in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes 
on december   we completed an offer to exchange up to million principal amount of our series b senior subordinated notes due for any and all outstanding senior subordinated notes due the old notes 
all of the million in aggregate principal amount of the old notes were validly tendered for exchange and have been accepted by us 
the new notes have substantially identical terms of the original notes  except that the new notes have been registered under the securities act of  as amended 
effect of inflation inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor  equipment and new materials 
we do not believe that inflation has had any material effect on our results of operations during the years ended december  and 
table of contents non gaap financial measures ebitda we determine ebitda by adding net interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization to net income loss 
reconciliations of both net income loss and cash flows from operations to ebitda are presented in the financial tables contained herein 
we rely on ebitda as a primary measure to review and assess the operating performance of our company and our management team in connection with our executive compensation and bonus plans 
we also use ebitda to compare our current operating results with corresponding periods and with the operating results of other companies in our industry 
we believe that it is useful to investors to provide disclosures of our operating results on the same basis as that used by our management 
we also believe that it can assist investors in comparing our performance to that of other companies on a consistent basis without regard to depreciation  amortization  interest or taxes  which do not directly affect our operating performance 
in addition  we also utilize ebitda as an assessment of our liquidity and our ability to meet our debt service obligations and satisfy our debt covenants  which are partially based on ebitda 
ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for net income  cash flows from operating activities and other consolidated income or cash flows statement data prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
some of these limitations are ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  ebitda does not reflect the significant interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on our debt  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  ebitda does not reflect income taxes or the cash requirements for any tax payments  and other companies in our industry may calculate ebitda differently than we do  thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
because of these limitations  ebitda should not be considered a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as a measure of performance in compliance with gaap 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using ebitda only supplementally 
see our consolidated statements of operations and our consolidated statements of cash flows included in our financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant estimates and judgments 

table of contents revenue recognition we derive revenues from six categories technology interoperability services  network services  number portability services  call processing services  enterprise solutions and off network database queries 
the revenue recognition policy for each of these areas is described under revenues above 
due to our billing cycles  which for some of our products lag as much as days after the calendar month in which the services are rendered  we estimate the amounts of unbilled revenue each reporting period 
our estimates are based on recent volume and pricing trends adjusted for material changes in contracted service  because actual information is not available immediately 
based on a retrospective review of our actual billings compared to our estimates  our estimates have been reasonable 
historically  our estimates have approximated our actual subsequently billed revenue 
unanticipated changes in volume and pricing trends or material changes in contracted service could adversely affect our estimates of unbilled revenue 
this estimate is critical to our financial statements because it impacts revenue and amounts recorded as accounts receivable on our balance sheet 
as of december   our estimated unbilled revenues were million 
a change in our estimate would result in either an increase or decrease in revenues and accounts receivable of approximately million 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to pay their invoices to us in full 
we regularly review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance after considering the size of the accounts receivable balance  each customer s expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer 
a portion of this analysis is dependent on our ability to gather reliable information about our customers specific circumstances 
as part of our analysis  we review significant invoices that are past due to determine if an allowance is necessary based on the risk category using the factors described above 
based on the circumstances  we place each customer into a risk category and assign reserve percentages between and 
our estimates of allowances for doubtful accounts have tracked well with our actual experience of customers who are unable to pay their invoices in full 
however  uncollectible accounts that are not identified or properly assessed in our review could have a significant impact on our bad debt provision 
in addition  if our customers financial condition or the economy in general deteriorates  we may need to increase these allowances for doubtful accounts 
excluding all risk categories that are reserved at  a change in each one of our risk categories would cause our allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  and our bad debt expense for the year then ended to change by million 
because we perform our analysis and establish reserves on a customer by customer basis  we generally do not record a general reserve 
however  if we were to apply a general reserve of to our unreserved accounts receivable balance  it would increase our allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  and our bad debt expense for the year then ended by approximately million 
allowance for credit memos we maintain a general reserve based on our historical credit memo activity 
in addition  we establish credit memo reserves resulting from specific customer matters 
this allowance is recorded as a direct reduction of accounts receivable and revenues 
since our allowances for credit memos are derived in large part from specific customer matters  our estimates have tracked well with our actual credit memo experience 
if our billing errors or discrepancies are not resolved satisfactorily or our customers disputes over billing are not resolved satisfactorily  increases to the allowance would be required 
recently  we have resolved some of these customer matters more favorably than originally estimated but we cannot provide any assurance this will continue 
as of december   our allowance for credit memos totaled million 
if our allowance for credit memos  including identified specific customer matters  changed by  our allowance for credit memos and revenues would change by approximately million 

table of contents impairment losses on long lived assets we review our long lived assets  including property and equipment and intangibles with definite lives for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
we also evaluate the useful life of our assets each reporting period  and if deemed to be shorter than originally estimated  would result in an increase in our annual depreciation and or amortization expense 
we have not had reason to adjust our estimated lives on these assets 
the impairment review consists of a comparison of the carrying value of the assets with the assets expected future undiscounted cash flows without interest costs 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is deemed to not be recoverable if it exceeds the sum of its undiscounted cash flows 
estimates of expected future cash flows are management s best estimate based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  asset impairment charges may be required 
management continues to evaluate overall industry and company specific circumstances and conditions to identify indicators of impairment 
during the third quarter of  indicators of impairment based on anticipated declines in call processing and the discontinuation of a carrier s use of our access billing services resulted in the company recording a million impairment charge for certain capitalized software  which thereafter had a carrying value of million 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of million on our customer base intangible assets resulting from a technology interoperability customer s notification to us that it did not intend to renew its contract for these services 
no impairment was recognized for the year ended december  impairment losses on goodwill and trademark we evaluate goodwill and our non amortizable intangible assets  such as trademarks  for impairment at least annually  or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise  in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
our evaluation consisted of measuring the trademark by using a discounted cash flow model and comparing the fair value to the carrying value 
an impairment loss would be recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
our evaluation of goodwill is measured by a two step impairment test 
the first step compares the fair value of our reporting unit  using a discounted cash flow model  with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we then compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill 
estimates of expected future cash flows represent management s best estimate based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  an impairment loss may be required to be recognized 
management will continue to evaluate overall industry and company specific circumstances and conditions as necessary 
no impairment was recognized for the year ended december  restructuring we have made estimates of the costs to be incurred as a part of our various restructuring plans 
we have also made estimates in september related to our acquisition of ios north america which was recorded as a part of our purchase accounting 
the payments related to this restructuring plan were completed in december in september  we formulated a restructuring plan to eliminate redundant positions at our syniverse holdings limited subsidiary 
as a result  we incurred million in severance related costs in the third quarter of the payments related to this restructuring plan were completed in december in february and august  we competed restructuring plans in our operations and marketing groups 
as a result  we incurred million in severance related costs 
as of december   our remaining restructuring accrual related to this plan was million 
we expect to pay the remaining restructuring costs in the balance in this account at december  continues to represent our best estimate 

table of contents loss contingencies we are involved in asserted and unasserted claims  which arise in the ordinary course of our business 
we routinely evaluate whether a loss is probable  and if so  whether it can be estimated 
estimates are based on similar case law matters  consultation with subject matter experts and information obtained through negotiations with counter parties 
as such  accurately depicting the outcome of pending litigation requires considerable judgment and is subject to material differences on final settlement 
accruals for probable losses are recorded in accrued expenses  or as a part of our allowance for credit memos if the dispute relates to a customer matter 
if our assessment of the probability is inaccurate  we may need to record additional accruals or reduce recorded accruals later 
in addition  we may need to adjust our estimates of the probable loss amounts as further information is obtained or we consider settlements 
historically  we have had few changes in estimates for these accruals 
the most significant claim against us was the sbc communications  inc  d b a sbc ameritech  sbc southwestern bell and sbc pacific bell collectively  sbc claim in the amount of million  which alleges that we overcharged sbc for services we provided to it 
on august   all claims between sbc and syniverse relating to this matter were settled resulting in a million charge to our statement of operations during the third quarter of purchase accounting we have made estimates of the fair values of the assets acquired as of february   the softwright holdings  ltd 
acquisition in december  the acquisition of ios north america in september and the acquisition of ithl in june  based primarily on appraisals from third parties and also based on certain internally generated information 
if the subsequent actual and updated projections of the underlying business activity change as compared to the underlying assumptions and projections used to develop these fair values  then we could experience impairment losses  as described above 
in addition  we have estimated the economic lives of certain of these assets and these lives were used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense 
if our estimates of the economic lives change  then additional depreciation or amortization expense could be incurred on an annual basis 
if the estimates of the economic lives on the definite lived intangible assets acquired as part of the above mentioned acquisitions were reduced by one year  our amortization expense would increase by approximately million 
income taxes we review our deferred tax assets on a regular basis to evaluate their recoverability based on projections of the turnaround timing of our deferred tax liabilities  projections of future taxable income  and tax planning strategies that we might employ to utilize such assets  including net operating loss carryforwards 
unless it is more likely than not that we will recover such assets through the above means  we establish a valuation allowance 
the effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate due primarily to changes in the valuation allowance 
brience had incurred net operating losses since inception and hence was unable to recognize the benefit of these losses in its financial statements tax provision 
our fourth quarter results include a reversal of a significant portion of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
a valuation allowance  originally established in and adjusted annually thereafter  was recorded as we determined that the realization of those tax assets did not meet the more likely than not criteria under accounting rules 
in the fourth quarter of  based upon an evaluation of our most recent seven quarters of profitability and the expectation of continued net income  a million tax benefit was recognized as we determined that we had met the more likely than not criteria related to certain net deferred tax assets 
we continue to maintain a valuation allowance for certain other net deferred tax assets primarily associated with foreign and state net operating losses and capital loss carry forwards 
the valuation allowance as of december  and was and million  respectively 

table of contents we have significant federal net operating losses nols and capital losses totaling approximately million and million  respectively  many of which we succeeded to as a result of our merger with brience 
all of our nols remain subject to examination and adjustment by the internal revenue service 
we do not believe that any of our nols are currently subject to any limitation under section of the code 
however  the nols acquired from brience are subject to the separate return limitation rules under the consolidated return regulations 
as a result  these nols generally can be utilized only to offset income from the consolidated group of corporations or their successors that generated such losses 
in addition  under section of the code  a corporation that undergoes an ownership change generally may utilize its pre change nols only to the extent of an annual amount determined by multiplying the applicable long term tax exempt rate by the equity value of such corporation 
a corporation generally undergoes an ownership change if the percentage of stock of the corporation owned by one or more stockholders has increased by more than percentage points over a three year period 
we do not believe the consummation of our initial public offering resulted in an ownership change under section of the code 
it is impossible for us to ensure that an ownership change will not occur in the future as changes in our stock ownership  some of which are outside of our control  could result in an ownership change under section of the code 
for example  the sale by one or more stockholders of our common stock and changes in the beneficial ownership of such stock could result in an ownership change under section of the code 
similarly  the exercise of outstanding stock options by our employees would count for purposes of determining whether we had an ownership change 
if we undergo an ownership change  our ability to utilize nols could be limited by section of the code 
the extent to which our use of our nols would be limited depends on a number of legal and factual determinations  some of which may be subject to varying interpretations  including the date on which an ownership change occurs  the long term tax exempt rate  whether the equity value of the entire company or only one or more of its subsidiaries would be used in the application of the section limitation and the equity value of the company or such subsidiaries  as applicable 
if it is determined that an ownership change has occurred prior to july   there is a significant risk that the amount of nols acquired from brience that would be useable in any one year after the ownership change would be severely limited 
if the limitation were significant  our limited ability to use these nols to offset future taxable income could materially increase our future us federal income tax liability 
stock based compensation we use the fair value of our company and of our common stock in determining the amount we are required to recognize as compensation expense as a result of any of our stock option grants 
prior to february   the date of our initial public offering  we determined the fair value of our company and the underlying value of the shares of our common stock based on internally generated valuations which we prepared contemporaneously with our stock option grants in the first and third quarters of we used the income approach using the discounted cash flow methodology and we believe that our methodologies were comparable to those that a third party would use 
our board of directors established the exercise price of all options issued under our stock option plans significantly above the fair value that the board of directors determined for the underlying common stock using the discounted cash flow methodology 
for these reasons  we did not obtain contemporaneous externally prepared valuations by a third party valuation specialist 
we selected underwriters for our initial public offering in october and did not grant any stock options through february   the date of our initial public offering 
in january  we received offering price range indications from the underwriters that were derived using multiple valuation approaches  including the trailing twelve months ttm ebitda comparable company approach 
based upon our discussions with the underwriters  we believed that at the time the ttm ebitda comparable company approach was a more 
table of contents appropriate methodology for valuing our company and our common stock since we were in the process of offering our common stock to the public 
this market approach methodology is preferable to the income approach for a company pursuing a public offering because it relies on and uses data generated by actual public company performance and the resulting trading prices and is also less susceptible to the uncertainties of future projections 
as a result  in january we retrospectively reassessed the values of our common stock at the various option grant dates utilizing the ttm ebitda comparable company approach 
to retrospectively determine the value of our common stock  we calculated the ttm ebitda multiples of the companies that we and our underwriters determined to be our publicly traded comparables 
the comparable companies are alliance data systems  automatic data processing  bisys group  certegy  first data  global payments  ipayment  paychex  tns and total systems services 
we calculated the ttm ebitda multiples of each comparable company using data from these companies sec filings and other publicly available sources 
for each period  we used our comparable companies median ttm ebitda multiple and applied a marketability discount to determine the value of our common stock 
inherent in this methodology is the positive impact that any increase in the comparable companies median ttm ebitda multiple has on the value of our common stock 
increases in our common stock value as a result of any such changes in comparable company multiples is independent of our financial performance 
the marketability discount  or discount for lack of marketability  reflected our prospects for completing a public offering of our common stock  the risk or volatility of our enterprise and our concentration of ownership 
we decreased this discount each quarter throughout as our financial performance improved throughout the year and the prospects for an initial public offering for our company improved 
the following summarizes our grants of stock options during the year ended december  because the exercise price of all options granted during the period exceeded the estimated fair value of the underlying common stock  none of these grants resulted in the recognition of compensation expense

significant factors  assumptions and methodologies used in determining fair value of our common stock for the year ended december   our revenues and ebitda were million and million  respectively  excluding the pre acquisition results of brience  restructuring charges and impairment losses on intangible assets 
this represented a annual decline in revenues and a annual decline in ebitda from the year ended december  our company s declining performance was the result of a number of factors  including declines in revenues from several key customers including verizon wireless  competitive pricing pressures and the continued decline in revenues from our call processing services 
furthermore  wlnp had only recently been implemented in november and consumer adoption rates for this service were still uncertain 
at the end of  the wireless telecommunications industry also continued to suffer from financial difficulties  
table of contents which curtailed demand for our new service offerings  increased pricing pressure on us and reduced our customers growth expectations 
in addition  at the end of  there was weak public market demand for wireless telecommunications services companies 
during the first nine months of  giving pro forma effect to the ios north america acquisition  our revenues and ebitda increased to million and million  respectively  excluding the pre acquisition results of brience  restructuring charges and impairment losses on intangible assets  or a and increase over the same period of the reasons for our improved financial performance include strong technology interoperability and network services transaction volume growth  an improving pricing environment for our services  the rapid growth of wlnp services and the successful acquisition of ios north america from eds 
furthermore  the improved financial position and market environment for our customers and the signing of several new international customers supported an improved outlook for our business 
during the fourth quarter of  our financial performance continued to significantly improve 
our revenues and ebitda increased during the quarter due to the completion of the ios acquisition  strong clearinghouse transaction processing volume growth and increases in network services messaging volumes 
in addition  we also signed domestic and international wi fi services contracts  including a contract with a major us carrier 
during the quarter  we also achieved a significant international expansion milestone by successfully signing our first major european clearinghouse contract

sfas is effective january  we have not yet evaluated the impact  if any  that sfas will have on our financial position or results of operations 
contractual obligations and commitments as of december   our contractual obligations consist only of our debt and operating leases 
we do not have a pension plan or other long term employee benefit plan

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates on our new senior credit facility 
our new senior credit facility is variable rate debt 
interest rate changes therefore generally do not affect the market value of such debt but do impact the amount of our interest payments and  therefore  our future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
on march   we had million of variable rate debt outstanding on our new senior credit facility 
holding other variables constant  including levels of indebtedness  a one percentage point increase in interest rates on our variable debt would have had an estimated impact on pre tax earnings and cash flows for the next year of approximately million 
under the terms of the new senior credit facility at least of our funded debt must bear interest that is effectively fixed 
as a result  we may from time to time be required to enter into interest rate protection agreements establishing a fixed maximum interest rate with respect to a portion of our total indebtedness 

table of contents as of december  and  we had variable rate debt of approximately million and million  respectively 
foreign currency market risk we are exposed to foreign currency risk in certain circumstances 
certain of our international clients currently pay us in euros and pounds sterling 
foreign currency fluctuations had an immaterial impact on our december  financial position and results of operations 
this could change in future periods due to our acquisition of ithl  which has as its functional currency the hong kong dollar and has contractual arrangements with multiple customers that are collectible and payable in currencies other than the functional currency  which could result in significant currency gains or losses 
at this time  we have not entered into any arrangements to hedge our risks from foreign currency
