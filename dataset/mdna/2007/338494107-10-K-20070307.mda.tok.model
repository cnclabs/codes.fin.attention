item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements  all included herein 
the information set forth in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
many factors  including but not limited to those discussed below under factors that may affect future results could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in these forward looking statements 
overview flanders is a full range air filtration product company engaged in designing  manufacturing and marketing air filtration products and certain related products and services 
our focus has evolved from expansion through acquisition to increasing the quality and efficiency of our high volume replacement filtration products  and using these benefits to compete more effectively in the marketplace 
we also design and manufacture much of our own production equipment as well as glass based media for many of our air filtration products 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion and analysis is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses  and assets and liabilities during the periods reported 
estimates are used when accounting for certain items such as revenues  allowances for returns  early payment discounts  customer discounts  doubtful accounts  employee compensation programs  depreciation and amortization periods  taxes  inventory values  insurance programs  and valuations of investments  goodwill  other intangible assets and long lived assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience  where applicable  and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual resul ts may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we base our estimates on the aging of our accounts receivable balances and our historical write off experience  net of recoveries 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we write down inventory balances for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
estimates of our insurance costs are developed by management s evaluation of the likelihood and probable amount of potential claims based on historical experience and evaluation of each claim 
changes in the key assumptions may occur in the future  which would result in changes to related insurance costs 
goodwill is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually or more frequently upon the occurrence of an event or when circumstances indicate that the company s carrying amount is greater than the fair value 
in accordance with sfas  the company examined goodwill for impairment and determined that the company s carrying amount did not exceed the fair value  thus  there was no impairment 
generally  sales are recognized when shipments are made to customers 
rebates  allowances for damaged goods and other advertising and marketing program rebates are accrued pursuant to contractual provisions and included in accrued expenses 
an insignificant amount of our revenues fall under the percentage of completion method of accounting used for long term contracts 
under this method  sales and gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion 
sales and gross profit are adjusted prospectively for revisions in estimated total contract costs and contract values 
estimated losses are recorded when identified 
results of operations thousands omitted  except per share amounts compared to the following table summarizes the company s results of operations as a percentage of net sales for and net sales gross profit operating expenses operating income nonoperating income expense earnings before income taxes provision for income taxes extraordinary items net earnings net sales net sales for increased by  or  to  from  for the increase in net sales was due to our success in increasing our market share in our industrial division which was partially offset by a downturn in our retail sector as well as delays in shipping containment 
the company introduced two new products  energy air and our new nested product which increased sales but was offset by the plant fire in texas and plant flood in pennsylvania which reduced manufacturing capacity 
gross profit gross profit for decreased  or  to  which made up of net sales  from  for  which made up of net sales 
the us economy experienced cost increases due to inflation including increases in in bound shipping costs due to increased fuel costs  raw material costs  especially in the cost of metal 
these costs were partially offset by vertical integration of certain manufacturing processes 
the gross profit during the quarter has decreased due to the start up of three new plants in clarkton  north carolina  dallas  texas and matamoros  mexico as well as new production lines for the energyaire and nested filters 
the plant fire in texas and the plant flood in auburn  pennsylvania increased the overall cost of production 
additionally  the product mix has shifted towards lower margin items  however it is a nticipated that this trend will reverse during the near term 
operating expenses operating expenses for increased  or  to  from  in operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased in to from in the increase in operating expenses was primarily caused by an increase in the number of sales locations resulting in increased salaries and commissions of  rents of and freight out of additionally  bad debt expense increased by nonoperating income expenses nonoperating expense increased approximately to of income for  compared to of expense in the increase was due to favorable litigation 
provision for income taxes our effective state and federal tax rate  adjusted for the effect of certain credits and adjustments  was approximately and for and  respectively 
the irs is currently examining the company s federal income tax returns of   and the irs has proposed certain changes resulting in additional liabilities due 
the company disagrees with the proposed changes and is vigorously contesting these proposed changes and believes any final changes will be immaterial 
extraordinary items in  a warehouse in texas was damaged by a fire and a warehouse in pennsylvania was damaged by a flood 
the company reported an extraordinary loss on the fire of  net of income taxes of

net sales gross profit operating expenses operating income nonoperating expense earnings before income taxes provision for income taxes net earnings net sales net sales for increased by  or  to  from  for the increase in net sales was due to our success in increasing our market share across generally all lines of our business 
gross profit gross profit for increased  or  to  which made up of net sales  from  for  which made up of net sales 
the gross profit increase was principally due to a higher sales volume while the decrease in gross profit percentage was primarily attributeable to increases in direct labor  transportation  raw material costs  and initial costs associated with new product offerings 
operating expenses operating expenses for increased  or  to  from  in the increase in operating expenses was primarily caused by a higher sales volume in operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased in to from due primarily to the higher sales volume covering certain fixed overhead costs 
nonoperating expense nonoperating expense increased approximately to of expense for  compared to in the increase was due to an increase in interest expense of partially offset by an increase in other income of provision for income taxes our effective state and federal tax rate  adjusted for the effect of certain credits and adjustments  was approximately and for and  respectively 
effects of inflation the company s business and operations have not been materially affected by inflation during the periods for which financial information is presented 
liquidity and capital resources dollar amounts in thousands working capital was  at december   compared to  at december  this included cash and cash equivalents of and at december  and  respectively 
the primary reason for the increase in working capital was the net earnings of the company plus borrowings on the line of credit to fund increases to inventory and accounts receivable partially offset by amounts used for acquisitions and to purchase equipment 
trade receivables increased  or at december  from  at december  the increase in accounts receivable is attributable to increased sales volume and the aging of various accounts along with the timing differences in shipments and payments received 
inventories increased  or to  at december  from  at december  the increased inventory was due to the stocking of three new plants and also carrying a larger supply of raw materials enabling the company to maintain its on time delivery and in stock percentages during the year 
also  higher levels of inventory balance labor requirements and facilitate longer product runs  thereby  increasing operating efficiencies 
continuing operations consumed  of cash in  compared to generating  of cash in the decrease in cash flows was primarily related to the increase in inventory partially offset by increase in payables 
investing activities for continuing operations consumed  of cash during  compared to consuming  during the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to the acquisition of equipment due to the fire and flood offset by insurance proceeds received 
financing activities provided  of cash in and  of cash in  consisting primarily of proceeds from the revolving credit agreement 
on october   we signed agreements for a new credit facility with fleet capital corporation  which replaced and repaid our previous million revolving credit facility 
the new million facility consists of a million term loan and a million revolving credit line  both of which expire on october  the term loan bears interest  at our option  at either i libor plus between and  dependent on the company s fixed charge coverage during the prior twelve months  or ii the greater of the federal funds effective rate plus or fleet s base rate  plus between and  dependent on the company s fixed charge coverage during the prior twelve months 
the million revolving credit facility bears interest at less than the term loan 
up to million of the revolving credit facility may be used to issue letters of credit 
the facility is collateralized by substantially all of the company  s assets 
the line of credit agreement requires maintenance of certain financial ratios  and restricts capital expenditures  dividends and share repurchases 
unless this credit facility is renewed  it will expire on october  in we signed a new million term loan which expires in august this term loan bears interest  at our option  at either i libor plus between and  dependent on the company s fixed charge coverage during the prior twelve months  or ii the greater of the federal funds effective rate plus or fleet s base rate  plus between and  dependent on the company s fixed charge coverage during the prior twelve months 
there are no prepayment penalties on any of the credit facilities with fleet capital corporation 
in connection with the amended working capital credit facility and notes payable to a regional development authority and bank  the company has agreed to certain restrictive covenants which include  among other things  not paying dividends or repurchasing its stock without prior written consent  and maintenance of certain financial ratios at all times including a minimum current ratio  minimum tangible net worth  a maximum ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
as of december  we had the following fixed obligations and commitments year ended december  operating leases capital leases long term debt other long term obligations thereafter we believe that our cash on hand  cash generated by operations  and cash available from our existing credit facilities is sufficient to meet the capital demands of our current operations during the fiscal year 
any major increases in sales  particularly in new products  may require substantial capital investment for the manufacture of filtration products 
failure to obtain sufficient capital could materially adversely impact our growth potential 
we are currently considering paying cash dividends in the future to holders of our common stock 
under the terms of our revolving credit line we cannot pay dividends without the prior written consent of the bank 
in  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to two million shares of our common stock  which repurchase was completed in september on september   the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional two million shares of common stock through open market or negotiated transactions 
further repurchases under this program are restricted under our current line of credit agreement  and require prior consent of fleet capital corporation 
as of february  approximately  shares had been repurchased in the open market under this authorization 
outlook global containment systems  inc gcs is a wholly owned subsidiary of flanders corporation which manufactures critical environments for the nuclear  pharmaceutical and semi conductor 
contingent on expanding demand for highly critical containment  we plan to expand our operations in aiken  sc 
this facility could accommodate the requirements for various nuclear containment projects scheduled at the westinghouse savannah river site in aiken  sc as well as other projects scheduled worldwide over the next ten years 
expansion into south carolina would provide a state of the art facility with room necessary to provide in place testing  integration  process control verification and final testing and final installation which is expected to provide gcs a unique position in this developing market 
this expansion is currently on hold until demand for these critical products exceeds our current capacity 
additionally  during  flanders complete service division flanders csd  an air filtration service provider was formed 
flanders csd offers weekly  monthly and quarterly service contracts for clean room and glove box certification  commercial  industrial  retail and residential surveys  and complete filtration management including mold remediation and analysis 
the company is currently negotiating several large contracts and if they are executed  the company expects to have national coverage by the end of during the past three years  we have captured additional market share among big box retailers like the home depot and wal mart  capitalizing on our ability to service national accounts from regional distribution centers and our improved on time delivery performance 
we anticipate additional market gains among these types of retailers during the next two years and are introducing new products focused on their marketing and end user requirements 
sales to these retail outlets  while seasonal  also tend to follow progress in the overall economy 
additional gains in market share in this market may not have a significant impact on revenues without some recovery in the overall us economy 
additionally  significant revenue enhancement to these customers is largely dependent upon the success of the new products we are introducing to this marketplace 
during the past three years  we introduced air filtration products which use the arm hammer and lysol brand name 
these products are expected to contribute to our expansion in the retail marketplace  but the extent to which they will do so  and their impact on the bottom line  is currently indeterminable 
we have adapted our biocontainment products for use as part of a system for hardening government buildings  commercial office complexes and public venues against airborne bioweapons such as anthrax and smallpox 
there is currently an increase of interest in these products over the past quarter 
any interest towards hardening these types of facilities against airborne bioweapons could have a significant impact on our business 
sales of air filtration products for semiconductor facilities  historically a major market  are expected to be slow again during  with most analysts pushing recovery for this sector out until however  the strengthening economy is also having a positive effect on sales of all our products 
we have collected data that indicates that residential filter users replace their filters  on average  approximately one and a half times per year 
manufacturers of residential furnace and air conditioning systems recommend that these filters be changed every month 
a minor trend toward increased maintenance of these residential heating and cooling systems could have a positive impact on our business 
our most common products  in terms of both unit and dollar volume  are residential throw away spun glass filters  which usually sell for prices under 
any increase in consumer concern regarding air pollution  airborne pollens  allergens  and other residential airborne contaminants could result in replacement of some of these products with higher value products 
our higher value products include our naturalaire higher efficiency filters for residential use  and our arm hammer co branded product  with associated sales prices typically over each 
any such trend would have a beneficial effect on our business 
we believe there is currently a gradually increasing public awareness of the issues surrounding indoor air quality and that this trend will continue for the next several years 
we also believe there is an increase in public concern regarding the effects of indoor air quality on employee productivity  as well as an increase in interest by standards making bodies in creating specifications and techniques for detecting  defining and solving indoor air quality problems 
we further believe there will be an increase in interest in our absolute isolation barriers in the future because these products may be used in both semiconductor and pharmaceutical manufacturing plants to prevent cross contamination between different lots and different processes being performed at the same facility 
these products also increase production yields in many applications 
currently  the largest domestic market for air filtration products is for mid range ashrae rated products and hvac systems  typically used in commercial and industrial buildings 
to date  our penetration of this market has been relatively small 
we believe our ability to offer a one stop supply of air filtration products to hvac distributors and wholesalers may increase our share of this market 
we also believe that our recently developed modular air handlers and environmental tobacco smoke systems will enable us to expand sales to these customers 
we intend our new products to serve as high profile entrants with distributors and manufacturers representatives  who can then be motivated to carry our complete product line 
we have continually looked for cost reductions in our products 
during the past five years  we have continued to complete the development and redesigning of numerous systems and products which were only partially completed when we acquired the companies which originally claimed to have fully developed them 
these products include the automated machinery necessary for high speed production of our pleated filters  acquired with precisionaire  and the mass production processes for bonded carbon high mass zero density products 
during  we built our first fully automated production lines which are expected to significantly reduce our labor related costs this outlook section  and other portions of this document  include certain forward looking statements within the meaning of that term in section a of the securities act of  and section e of the securities exchange act of  including  among others  those statements preceded by  following or including the words believe  expect  intend  anticipate or similar expressions 
these forward looking statements are based largely on the current expectations of management and are subject to a number of assumptions  risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from these forward looking statements 
important factors to consider in evaluating such forward looking statements include those discussed in item a 
risk factors as well as the shortage of reliable market data regarding the air filtration market  changes in external competitive market factors or in our internal budgeting process which might impact trends in our results of operations  anticipated working capital or other cash requirements  changes in our business strategy or an inability to execute our strategy due to unanticipated changes in the market  product obsolescence due to the development of new technologies  and various competitive factors that may prevent us from competing successfully in the marketplace 
in light of these risks and uncertainties  there can be no assurance that the events contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this form k will in fact occur 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollar amounts in thousands we are exposed to various market risks  primarily changes in interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse change in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
for flanders  these exposures are primarily related to changes in interest rates 
we do not hold any derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the fair value of the company s total long term debt  including capital leases and current maturities of long term debt  at december  was  market risk was estimated as the potential decrease increase in future earnings and cash flows resulting from a hypothetical increase decrease in the company s estimated weighted average borrowing rate at december  although most of the interest on the company s debt is indexed to a market rate  there would be no material effect on the future earnings or cash flows related to the company s total debt for such a hypothetical change 
we have only a limited involvement with derivative financial instruments 
we have two interest rate swap agreements to hedge against the potential impact on earnings from increases in market interest rates of two variable rate bonds 
under the interest rate swap agreements  we receive or make payments on a monthly basis  based on the differential between and a tax exempt interest rate as determined by a remarketing agent 
this interest rate swap is accounted for as a cash flow hedge in accordance with sfas and sfas gains or losses related to inefficiencies of the cash flow hedge were included in net income during the period related to hedge ineffectiveness 
the tax affected fair market value of the interest rate swap of is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the balance sheet 
the interest rate swap contracts expire in and the company s financial position is not materially affected by fluctuations in currencies against the us dollar  since assets held outside the united states are negligible 
risks due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates are negligible  as the preponderance of our foreign sales occur over short periods of time or are demarcated in us dollars
