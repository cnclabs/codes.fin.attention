table of contents growth in revenue  to date  has generally been the result of establishing offices in major markets 
the following table summarizes for each fiscal year the number of offices opened  international expansion and the creation of additional service offerings 
number of united states number of international fiscal year offices opened offices opened establishment of service offering nine finance and accounting nine ten information management four three human capital nine one two six one resources audit solutions  supply chain management via acquisition two opened  two consolidation closures seven opened via acquisition  one organic two opened  two consolidation closures one opened via acquisition  two organic legal three two opened via acquisition  eight organic one eight organic opened  three consolidation closures during fiscal  we continued our expansion around the world  opening offices in three additional european countries  two offices in mexico and one additional office in canada  china and japan 
we also opened an additional office in the united states in the expanding chicago marketplace 
at may   we served our clients through offices in the united states and offices abroad 
on june   the company completed the acquisition of compliance solutions uk ltd  a united kingdom based provider of regulatory compliance services to investment advisors  hedge funds  private equity and venture capital firms  insurance companies and other financial institutions 
the company paid approximately million for the acquisition  consisting of million in cash and million in the company s stock 
we expect to continue pushing forward on our international expansion while also investing in complementary professional services  like regulatory compliance 
we primarily charge our clients on an hourly basis for the professional services of our associates 
we recognize revenue once services have been rendered and invoice the majority of our clients on a weekly basis 
our clients are contractually obligated to pay us for all hours billed 
to a much lesser extent  we also earn revenue if a client hires one of our associates 
this type of contractually non refundable revenue is recognized at the time our client completes the hiring process and represented  and of our revenue for the years ended may   and  respectively 
we periodically review our outstanding accounts receivable balance and determine an estimate of the amount of those receivables we believe may prove uncollectible 
our provision for bad debts is included in our selling  general and administrative expenses 
the costs to pay our professional associates and all related benefit and incentive costs  including provisions for paid time off and other employee benefits  are included in direct cost of services 
we pay most of our associates on an hourly basis for all hours worked on client engagements and  therefore  direct cost of services tends to vary directly with the volume of revenue we earn 
we expense the benefits we pay to our associates as they are earned 
these benefits include paid time off and holidays  a bonus incentive plan  referral bonus programs  subsidized group health  dental  vision and life insurance programs  a matching k retirement plan  the ability to participate in the company s employee stock purchase plan espp  and professional development and career training 
in addition  we pay the related costs of employment  including state and federal payroll taxes  workers 
table of contents compensation insurance  unemployment insurance and other costs 
typically  an associate must work a threshold number of hours to be eligible for all of the benefits 
we recognize direct cost of services when incurred 
selling  general and administrative expenses include the payroll and related costs of our internal management as well as general and administrative  marketing and recruiting costs 
our sales and marketing efforts are led by our management team who are salaried employees and earn bonuses based on operating results for our company as a whole and within each individual s geographic market 
the company s fiscal year consists of or weeks  ending on the last saturday in may 
for fiscal years of weeks  such as fiscal  the first three quarters consist of weeks each and the fourth quarter consists of weeks 
the actual quarter end dates for fiscal and were as follows for fiscal  august  first quarter  november  second quarter  february  third quarter  and may  fourth quarter  and for fiscal  august  first quarter  november  second quarter  february  third quarter  and may  fourth quarter 
for convenience  all references herein to years or annual periods of one or more years are to years or annual periods ended may critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that we believe a are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and b involve inherently uncertain issues that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
valuation of long lived assets we assess the potential impairment of long lived tangible and intangible assets periodically or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
under the current accounting standard  our goodwill and certain other intangible assets are no longer subject to periodic amortization over their estimated useful lives 
these assets are now considered to have an indefinite life and their carrying values are required to be assessed by us for impairment at least annually 
depending on future market values of our stock  our operating performance and other factors  these assessments could potentially result in impairment reductions of these intangible assets in the future and this adjustment may materially affect the company s future financial results 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our clients failing to make required payments for services rendered 
we estimate this allowance based upon our knowledge of the financial condition of our clients  review of historical receivable and reserve trends and other pertinent information 
if the financial condition of our clients deteriorates or we note an unfavorable trend in aggregate receivable collections  additional allowances may be required and these additional allowances may materially affect the company s future financial results 
income taxes in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates of income taxes  if applicable  in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
the process incorporates an assessment of any current tax exposure together with temporary differences resulting from different treatment of transactions for tax and financial statement purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
the recovery of deferred tax assets from future taxable income must be assessed and  to the extent recovery is not likely  we will establish a valuation allowance 
an increase in the valuation allowance results in recording additional tax expense 
if the ultimate tax liability differs from the amount of tax expense we have reflected in the consolidated statements of income  an adjustment of tax expense may need to be recorded and this adjustment may materially affect the company s future financial results 

table of contents revenue recognition we primarily charge our clients on an hourly basis for the professional services of our associates 
we recognize revenue once services have been rendered and invoice the majority of our clients in the united states on a weekly basis 
some of our clients served by our international operations are billed on a monthly basis 
our clients are contractually obligated to pay us for all hours billed 
to a much lesser extent  we also earn revenue if a client hires one of our associates 
this type of contractually non refundable revenue is recognized at the time our client completes the hiring process 
stock based compensation under our performance incentive plan  officers  employees  and outside directors have received or may receive grants of restricted stock  stock units  options to purchase common stock or other stock or stock based awards 
under our espp  eligible officers and employees may purchase our common stock in accordance with the terms of the plan 
effective june   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method  accordingly  prior periods have not been restated 
stock based compensation expense recognized in the company s financial statements for the year ended may  included compensation expense for stock options granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  may  under the previously accepted accounting standards  there was no stock based compensation expense related to employee stock options and employee stock purchases recognized during prior periods 
the adoption of sfas r requires that the company estimate a value for employee stock options on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
we have elected to use the black scholes option pricing model which takes into account assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
additional variables to be considered are the expected term and risk free interest rate over the expected term of our employee stock options 
in addition  because stock based compensation expense recognized in the statement of income is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience 
if facts and circumstances change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  the compensation expense recorded under sfas r may differ materially from the amount recorded in the current period 
the weighted average estimated value per share of employee stock options granted during year ended may  was using the black scholes model with the following assumptions year ended may  expected volatility risk free interest rate expected dividends expected life years years the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the term of our employee stock options 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our previous history of not paying dividends and our expectation that the special dividend to be paid in august is an isolated event and not the commencement of a regular dividend policy 
as permitted under staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
 the company used the vanilla option term for measuring the expected life of stock option grants during the first nine months of fiscal  under this option  a stock option grant with a year contractual life and four year vesting would have an expected life of years 
after completion of a review of the company s historical expected life of stock option grants  the company modified its expected life to approximately years for the grant made in the fourth quarter of fiscal also  as permitted under sab no 
 the company has used its historical volatility over the revised estimated life to estimate the expected volatility of the price of its common stock 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying 
table of contents value of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
results of operations the following tables set forth  for the periods indicated  our consolidated statements of income data 
these historical results are not necessarily indicative of future results 
for the years ended may  amounts in thousands revenue direct cost of services gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses amortization of intangible assets depreciation expense income from operations interest income income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income our operating results for the periods indicated are expressed as a percentage of revenue below 
for the years ended may  revenue direct cost of services gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses amortization of intangible assets depreciation expense income from operations interest income income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income year ended may  compared to year ended may  computations of percentage change period over period are based upon the truncated numbers presented herein 
revenue 
revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended may  from million for the year ended may  the continued expansion of our scope of services and improved overall demand for our services triggered the increase in revenue  resulting in more billable hours for our associates and an improvement in rate per hour 
we believe our business expanded due in part to increasing market awareness of our ability to provide services 
in particular  finance and accounting services increased significantly in the current year compared to the prior year 
we believe one of the reasons for the increase in these types of engagements is new projects from existing clients who had engaged us to provide services during their initial phase 
table of contents of compliance with sarbanes 
all of our other service offerings except for ras experienced growth in fiscal compared to fiscal though we believe we have improved the awareness of our service offerings with clients and prospective clients because of assistance we have provided during the initial years of compliance with sarbanes  there can be no assurance that there will be continuing demand for sarbanes or related internal accounting control services 
average bill rates improved by compared to the prior year average bill rate 
the increase in revenue was also driven by the increase in the number of associates on assignment from  at the end of fiscal to  at the end of fiscal we operated and offices during the final quarters of fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our clients do not sign long term contracts with us 
therefore  our future revenue or operating results cannot be reliably predicted from previous quarters or from extrapolation of past results 
revenue for domestic united states offices improved or million from million for the year ended may  to million for the year ended may  revenue for the dutch practice improved or million  from million for the year ended may  to million for the year ended may  the other international offices revenue grew or million  from million for the year ended may  to million for the year ended may  revenue growth in the international practices was approximately million more in fiscal compared to fiscal than would have been the case using local currencies  due to the weakening of the united states dollar against international currencies 
direct cost of services 
direct cost of services increased million  or  to million for the year ended may  from million for the year ended may  the increase in direct cost of services was attributable to the previously described expansion of the scope of services resulting in more chargeable hours for our associates at higher average pay rates  overall  the average pay rate per hour increased by year over year 
the direct cost of services as a percentage of revenue the direct cost of services percentage was and for the years ended may  and  respectively 
this slight increase was caused by an increase in the ratio of direct associate salary expense compared to hourly revenue generated in fiscal as compared to fiscal the cost of compensation and related benefits offered to the associates of our international offices has been greater as a percentage of revenue than our domestic operations 
in addition  international offices use independent contractors more extensively 
thus  the direct cost of services percentage of our international offices has usually exceeded our domestic operation s targeted direct cost of services percentage of 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenue from for the year ended may  to for the year ended may  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue was caused by the adoption in the first quarter of fiscal of the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r 
prior to fiscal  the company accounted for its stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of apb  accounting for stock issued to employees 
under apb  the intrinsic value of the options was used to record compensation expense and if the grant price of the options was equal to the fair market value of the option at the date of grant  no compensation expense related to the stock options was included in determining net income and net income per share 
under sfas r  the company determines an estimated value of stock options using the black scholes valuation model 
the estimated value determined is recognized as expense over the service period for options that are expected to vest the company s stock options vest over four years 
as a result of the implementation of sfas r  the company recognized non cash stock based compensation expense of approximately million for the year ended may  there was no corresponding amount recorded during fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended may  from million for the year ended may  the increase of million includes the amount recognized for non cash stock based compensation expense of million for the year ended may  the remaining million of the increase is due to the company hiring additional personnel across the enterprise to support and position the larger organization for potential future revenue growth 
in particular  compensation and related benefit expenses increased as management and administrative headcount grew from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal the increase in dollars spent on compensation was primarily attributable to the increase in salaries and benefit costs as a result of the larger headcount 
other increases 
table of contents in fiscal were an increase in spending for advertising  as the company launched a new branding campaign in various united states and international business periodicals  occupancy and related costs from relocated  expanded or new offices  and bonus expense as a result of the company s improved revenue results 
after considering the improvement in its accounts receivable aging statistics and other qualitative factors  the company did not recognize any addition to its allowance for doubtful accounts for fiscal amortization and depreciation expense 
amortization of intangible assets decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease is attributable to the completion of amortization of intangible assets related to previous acquisitions 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company completed an analysis of the allocation of purchase price related to the acquisition of the remaining of nordic spring for million 
the company allocated the purchase price based on the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the residual recorded as goodwill 
the total intangible assets acquired include approximately million for goodwill   for customer relationships and  for an associate database 
both intangible assets acquired are amortized over two years 
depreciation expense increased from million for the year ended may  to million for the year ended may  the increase in depreciation was related to a higher asset base due to the investments made in offices relocated or expanded since may  and investments in the company s new operating system and other information technology 
in october  the company purchased an office building in irvine  california for approximately million to use as its corporate office and domestic service center 
the company moved to the new location in july as the company completes the implementation of its information technology system  completes and begins depreciation of improvements to the new office building and invests in expanded or new office space for existing offices  it is expected that the company s depreciation expense will increase 
interest income 
interest income was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in interest income is a combination of a higher average balance available for investment as well as higher interest rates in fiscal the company has invested available cash in money market and commercial paper investments that have been classified as cash equivalents due to the short maturities of these investments 
in addition  as of may   the company has million of investments in government agency bonds with remaining maturity dates between three months and one year from the balance sheet date classified as short term investments and considered held to maturity securities 
in addition  the company also holds million in government agency bonds with maturity dates in excess of one year from the balance sheet date 
the bonds  classified as long term investments  mature through may and have coupon rates ranging from to 
these investments have been classified in the may  consolidated balance sheet as held to maturity securities 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased from million for the year ended may  to million for the year ended may  the effective tax rate was for fiscal and for fiscal the primary reason for the increase was due to the company s adoption of sfas r and as a result  the company s projected effective tax rate increased by percentage points for fiscal under sfas r  the company cannot recognize a tax benefit for certain incentive stock option iso grants unless and until the holder exercises his or her option and then sells the shares within a certain period of time 
in addition  the company can only recognize a tax benefit for employees acquisition and subsequent sale of shares purchased through the espp if the sale occurs within a certain defined period 
as a result  the company s provision for income taxes is likely to fluctuate from historical rates for the foreseeable future 
further  under sfas r  those tax benefits associated with iso grants fully vested at the date of adoption of sfas r will be recognized as additions to paid in capital when and if those options are exercised and not as a reduction to the company s tax provision 
the company recognized a benefit of approximately million related to stock based compensation for nonqualified stock options expensed and for eligible disqualifying iso exercises during fiscal the timing and amount of eligible disqualifying iso exercises cannot be predicted 
beginning with grants in fiscal  the company intends to predominantly grant nonqualified stock options to employees in the united states 

table of contents periodically  the company reviews the components of both book and taxable income to analyze the adequacy of the tax provision 
there can be no assurance that the company s effective tax rate will not increase in the future 
year ended may  compared to year ended may  computations of percentage change period over period are based upon the truncated numbers presented herein 
revenue 
revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended may  from million for the year ended may  the continued expansion of our scope of services and improved overall demand for our services triggered the increase in revenue  resulting in more billable hours for our associates and an improvement in rate per hour 
we believe our business expanded due in part to increasing market awareness of our ability to provide services 
in particular  finance and accounting services increased significantly in the current year compared to the prior year 
we believe one of the reasons for the increase in these types of engagements is new projects from existing clients who had engaged us to provide services during their initial phase of compliance with sarbanes 
to a lesser extent  all of our other service offerings experienced growth in fiscal compared to fiscal except for the ras service line 
average bill rates improved by compared to the prior year average bill rate 
the increase in revenue was also driven by the increase in the number of associates on assignment from  at the end of fiscal to  at the end of fiscal we operated and offices during the final quarters of fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
revenue for domestic united states offices improved or million from million for the year ended may  to million for the year ended may  revenue for the dutch practice improved or million  from million for the year ended may  to million for the year ended may  the other international offices revenue grew or million  from million for the year ended may  to million for the year ended may  revenue growth in the international practices was approximately million less in fiscal compared to fiscal than would have been the case using local currencies  due to the strengthening of the united states dollar against international currencies 
virtually all international practices enjoyed growth both from referrals from the united states as well as from internally generated opportunities  particularly in the united kingdom  sweden  japan  hong kong  france and canada 
direct cost of services 
direct cost of services increased million  or  to million for the year ended may  from million for the year ended may  the increase in direct cost of services was attributable to the previously described expansion of the scope of services resulting in more chargeable hours for our associates at higher average pay rates  overall  the average pay rate per hour increased by year over year 
the direct cost of services percentage was and for the years ended may  and  respectively 
the direct cost of services percentage increased between the two years because the volume of client reimbursable expenses was higher in fiscal  as the number of projects requiring associate travel increased 
in addition  a slight improvement in the ratio of direct associate salary expense compared to hourly revenue generated in fiscal was offset by a slight increase in compensation related benefits 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenue from for the year ended may  to for the year ended may  as the company hired additional personnel across the enterprise to support and position the larger organization for future revenue growth 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended may  from million for the year ended may  in particular  compensation and related benefit expenses increased as management and administrative headcount grew from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal the increase in dollars spent on compensation was primarily attributable to the increase in salaries and benefit costs as a result of the larger headcount 
other increases in fiscal were bonus expense as a result of the company s improved revenue results and costs associated with the rollout of the company s new information technology system and european service center 
these increases were partially offset by reduced provision for doubtful accounts during fiscal and the reduction of spending on national advertising compared to fiscal 
table of contents amortization and depreciation expense 
amortization of intangible assets was approximately million in both fiscal and depreciation expense increased from million for the year ended may  to million for the year ended may  the increase in depreciation was related to a higher asset base due to the investments made in offices relocated or expanded since may  and investments in the company s new operating system and other information technology 
also  in october  the company purchased an office building in irvine  california for approximately million 
interest income 
during fiscal  interest income was million compared to interest income of million in fiscal the increase in interest income is a combination of a higher average balance available for investment in fiscal and higher interest rates during fiscal the company has invested available cash in money market and commercial paper investments that have been classified as cash equivalents due to the short maturities of these investments 
in addition  as of may   the company has million of investments in government agency bonds with remaining maturity dates between three months and one year from the balance sheet date classified as short term investments and considered held to maturity securities 
in addition  the company also holds million in government agency bonds with maturity dates in excess of one year from the balance sheet date 
the bonds  classified as long term investments  mature through may and have coupon rates ranging from to 
these investments have been classified in the may  consolidated balance sheet as held to maturity securities 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased from million for the year ended may  to million for the year ended may  the increase was the result of the company s higher pre tax income during fiscal  offset by a decrease in the effective tax rate from in fiscal to in fiscal the company s effective tax rate was lower in fiscal due primarily to the impact on the tax provision of the improved operating results of the company s international offices with lower statutory tax rates than the united states

our quarterly results have fluctuated in the past and we believe they will continue to do so in the future 
certain factors that could affect our quarterly operating results are described in part i item a 
risk factors 
due to these and other factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful indicators of future performance 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by our operations and  historically  to a lesser extent  stock option exercises 
we have generated positive cash flows from operations since inception  and we continued to do so during the year ended may  at may   the company had operating leases  primarily for office premises  expiring at various dates 
at may   the company had no capital leases 
future minimum rental commitments under operating leases are as follows payments due by period amounts in thousands less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations purchase obligations the company has a million unsecured revolving credit facility with bank of america the credit agreement 
the credit agreement allows the company to choose the interest rate applicable to advances 
the interest rate options are bank of america s prime rate  a london inter bank offered libor rate plus or bank of america s grand cayman banking center libor rate plus 
interest  if any  is payable monthly 
there is an annual facility fee of payable on the unutilized portion of the credit agreement 
the credit agreement expires december  as of may   the company had million available under the terms of the credit agreement as bank of america has issued  of outstanding letters of credit in favor of third parties related to operating leases 
the company is in compliance with all covenants included in the credit agreement 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal cash provided by operations in fiscal resulted from the net income of the company of million  adjusted for non cash items of million  plus net cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities of million 
in fiscal  cash provided by operations resulted from net income of the company of million  adjusted for non cash items of million  offset by net cash used for changes in operating assets and liabilities of million 
non cash items increased in fiscal as a result of the company s adoption of the accounting required in sfas r to expense stock based compensation  these charges do not reflect an actual cash outflow from the company but are an estimate of the fair value of the services provided by employees and directors in exchange for stock option grants and purchase of stock through the company s espp 
the company had million in cash and cash equivalents  million in short term investments and million of united states government agency securities at may  net cash used in investing activities totaled million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal cash used to invest in short term and long term marketable securities commercial paper and government agency bonds net of cash received from the redemption of short term and long term investments resulted in a net use of million in fiscal and million in fiscal in addition  the company used approximately million on property and equipment in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the cash spent in fiscal included approximately million for the purchase of a  square foot office building in irvine  california 
the company relocated its corporate office and domestic service center to the new location in july  however  some of the building will continue to be leased to existing tenants until such time as the company requires use of the entire building 
the remaining amounts used for property and equipment were primarily for technology upgrades to the company s operating systems as well as on leasehold improvements and office equipment during both fiscal and the company also completed the purchase of the remaining shares of nordic spring for million in fiscal net cash used in financing activities totaled million for the year ended may   compared to net cash provided by financing activities of  for the year ended may  the primary cause of the change was the company s purchase during fiscal of approximately million shares of its common stock at an average price of per share for approximately million  this compares with the repurchase in the prior year of  shares of its common stock at an average price of per share for a total of approximately million 
this was offset by cash received from stock option exercises and sales of common stock through the espp of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal 
table of contents our ongoing operations and anticipated growth in the geographic markets we currently serve will require us to continue to make investments in capital equipment  primarily technology hardware and software 
in addition  we may consider making strategic acquisitions 
subsequent to our fiscal year end  on july   our board of directors approved the payment of a special cash dividend of per share of common stock  payable on august  to shareholders of record on august  this special cash dividend is expected to be approximately million 
we anticipate that our current cash and the ongoing cash flows from our operations will be adequate to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
if we require additional capital resources to grow our business  either internally or through acquisition  we may seek to sell additional equity securities or to secure additional debt financing 
the sale of additional equity securities or the addition of new debt financing could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
we may not be able to obtain financing arrangements in amounts or on terms acceptable to us in the future 
in the event we are unable to obtain additional financing when needed  we may be compelled to delay or curtail our plans to develop our business  which could have a material adverse affect on our operations  market position and competitiveness 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended may  and is incorporated herein by reference 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
at the end of fiscal  we had approximately million of cash  highly liquid short term investments and long term united states government agency securities 
securities that the company has the ability and positive intent to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost 
these securities consist of commercial paper and government agency bonds 
cost approximates market for these securities 
the earnings on these investments are subject to changes in interest rates  and to the extent interest rates were to decline  it would reduce our interest income 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
prior to fiscal  our foreign operations were not significant to our overall operations  and our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk was low 
however  as our strategy to continue expanding foreign operations progresses  more of our revenues will be derived from foreign operations denominated in the currency of the applicable markets 
for the year ended may   approximately of the company s revenues were generated outside of the united states 
as a result  our operating results are subject to fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies in relation to the united states dollar 
revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into united states dollars at the monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
thus  as the value of the united states dollar fluctuates relative to the currencies in our non us based operations  our reported results may vary 
assets and liabilities of our non united states based operations are translated into united states dollars at the exchange rate effective at the end of each monthly reporting period 
ninety per cent of our fiscal year end balances of cash  short term investments and investments in marketable securities were denominated in united states dollars 
the remaining was comprised primarily of cash balances translated from swedish krona  euros  british pounds  hong kong dollars or japanese yen 
the difference resulting from the translation each period of assets and liabilities of our non united states based operations is recorded in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive gain 
although we intend to monitor our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations  including the use of financial hedging techniques if and when we may deem it appropriate  we cannot assure you that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial results in the future
