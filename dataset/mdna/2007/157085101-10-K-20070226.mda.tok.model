intercept blood system for plasma the intercept blood system for plasma  or plasma system  is designed to inactivate blood borne pathogens in donated plasma for transfusion 
we completed the last of three planned phase iii clinical trials of the plasma system in  and the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints of the trial for therapeutic plasma exchange were met 
the study showed no clinically and statistically significant differences in overall adverse events between the treatment group and the control group 
a final phase iii report was submitted to the fda in based on the results of the phase iii clinical trials  we received ce mark approval for the plasma system in november and have prioritized the commercial launch of the plasma system in europe ahead of further regulatory efforts relating to the plasma system in the united states 
we obtained french in country approval of the plasma system in january  subject to publication in the official journal 
pathogen inactivated plasma is already reimbursed in many european countries 
information regarding our revenues from the plasma system for the years ended december    and can be found in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  and item a  consolidated financial statements and supplementary data 
intercept blood system for red blood cells the intercept blood system for red blood cells  or red blood cell system  is designed to inactivate blood borne pathogens in donated red blood cells for transfusion 
in september  we terminated phase iii clinical trials of the red blood cell system due to the detection of antibody reactivity to intercept treated red blood cells in two patients 
we evaluated the antibodies detected in the trial and developed process changes that may greatly diminish the likelihood of antibody reactivity in red blood cells treated with our modified process 
we announced several findings related to these evaluations and developments in late and at several scientific and trade association meetings 
based on these findings and other preclinical work we have conducted  we re entered phase i clinical trials for the red blood cell system in the united states in the second half with our modified process  and expect to complete phase i trial by mid we expect to spend approximately two years developing and implementing commercial product and system design changes to the original red blood cell system prior to entering phase iii clinical trials no earlier than late collaborations baxter we collaborated with baxter on the development and commercialization of the intercept blood system commencing in effective february   we entered into a restructuring of our agreements with baxter pursuant to which we obtained exclusive worldwide commercialization rights to market  distribute and sell the platelet and plasma systems  excluding certain asian countries where we have licensed rights to bioone 
we regained worldwide commercialization rights to market the red blood cell system from baxter in february in connection with the transfer of commercialization rights to us  baxter agreed to supply  at our expense  certain transition services  including regulatory  technical and related administrative support through december  we agreed to purchase uva illumination devices from baxter in inventory in february and  intercept platelet and plasma system disposable kits from baxter s inventory 
baxter has agreed to manufacture systems and components for the platelet and plasma systems on a cost plus basis through december   and components through december  baxter also has agreed to supply only very limited types of components for the prototype of the red blood cell system 
we will be obligated to pay baxter royalties on future intercept blood system product sales at royalty rates that vary by product of 
table of contents product sales for the platelet system  for the plasma system and for the red blood cell system 
as a result of the agreement  we recognized gains and deferred gains in excess of million in at december   we had approximately million in remaining deferred gains  all of which are associated with payments made to vendors by december  in support of intercept commercialization efforts 
we anticipate recognizing the remainder of the deferred gain balance in as the services are completed by the vendors 
bioone in june  we entered into an agreement with baxter and bioone for commercialization of our platelet system in specified parts of asia 
under the terms of the agreement  bioone is responsible  at its expense  for seeking regulatory approvals for the platelet system in japan  china  taiwan  south korea  thailand  vietnam and singapore in exchange for exclusive marketing and distribution rights in each of those countries 
we have received a total of million in up front payments under the terms of the agreement and will be eligible to receive contingent milestone payments for our sole account and royalties on future product sales  which will be shared equally by baxter and us 
in june  we announced our entry into a definitive agreement with baxter and bioone for commercialization of our plasma system in specified parts of asia 
under the terms of the definitive agreement  bioone is responsible  at its expense  for seeking regulatory approvals for the plasma system in japan  china  taiwan  south korea  thailand  vietnam and singapore in exchange for exclusive marketing and distribution rights in each of those countries 
we have received a total of million in cash and million in bioone equity securities in connection with the definitive agreement as of december  and will be eligible to receive i contingent milestone payments  payable to us solely  and ii royalties on future product sales  which will be shared by baxter and us 
us armed forces in february  we were awarded million under a cooperative agreement with the army medical research acquisition activity division of the department of defense 
in september  may  january  august  july  and september we were awarded additional funding of million  million  million  million  million  and million  respectively  all of which was for the continued funding of projects to develop our pathogen inactivation technologies to improve the safety and availability of blood for medical transfusions 
under the terms of the agreements  we are conducting research on the inactivation of infectious pathogens in blood  including unusual viruses  bacteria and parasites  which are of concern to the us armed forces 
medimmune in april  we entered into an agreement with medimmune to co develop a novel therapeutic vaccine designed to target antigens expressed in breast  prostate and colon cancer  as well as metastatic melanoma 
medimmune is developing medi epha using our listeria vaccine platform and medimmune s epha cancer antigen 
under the terms of the agreement  we have conducted preclinical development activities in support of medimmune  which is responsible for preclinical development  clinical testing  manufacturing and commercialization of any product resulting from the collaboration  and development of a therapeutic vaccine candidate 
we received development funding and may receive contingent milestone payments and royalties on future product sales 
as of december   we had received up front and milestone payments of million from medimmune under the terms of the agreement  as well as development funding 
the million in milestone and upfront payments consist of a million up front payment and a million milestone payment 
we recognized revenue of million  million and million from medimmune during the years ended december   and  respectively 

table of contents immunotherapy background we are using our proprietary  versatile vaccine platforms to develop therapies to stimulate the immune system to selectively target and attack cancer cells and infectious diseases 
our vaccine platforms are based on specially designed and proprietary strains of the bacterium listeria monocytogenes 
we believe that our proprietary strains of listeria  alone or expressing cancer antigens  have the potential to harness the power of the immune system to selectively attack cancer cells 
in september  preclinical efficacy and safety data for our attenuated listeria based cancer immunotherapy technology were published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences  or pnas 
the pnas paper described studies in which experimental vaccines based on our proprietary listeria platform were engineered to express specific tumor antigens 
these vaccines were shown to elicit therapeutic anti tumor responses in tumor bearing mice  resulting in prolonged survival 
in addition  the listeria strain used in these studies demonstrated a one thousand fold reduction in toxicity when compared to wild type listeria 
in comparison to other strains  the optimized platform listeria strain used in the studies was cleared more rapidly in vivo and showed significantly higher safety margins while preserving immunogenic potency 
when used at comparable doses to unmodified listeria  the optimized strain generated equivalent immune responses  yet could be administered at higher doses  resulting in more potent t cell responses than possible with wild type listeria 
finally  therapeutic administration of an experimental vaccine using the optimized strain resulted in a significant reduction in metastases and a significant increase in survival in mice with established tumors 
in addition to our attenuated listeria vaccine platform  we have developed a second immunotherapy platform based on our kbma technology 
we currently are utilizing this platform to develop therapeutic and prophylactic vaccines for serious infectious diseases 
our kbma platform is based on the application of our proprietary helinx technology  which is designed to bind with the dna of infectious pathogens resulting in their inability to replicate 
using this method  we are able to inhibit the infectivity  but maintain the metabolic activity of specially engineered  proprietary pathogens 
accordingly  we are seeking to develop kbma vaccine candidates that retain the potency typically found in live viral and bacterial vaccines  but with the safety advantages of killed vaccines 
a scientific paper detailing preclinical data on kbma listeria as a vaccine platform appeared in the august edition of nature medicine 
early research and development efforts relating to our kbma technology platform have been funded in part by grants from the nih and the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases  or niaid 
under other grants  we are conducting early preclinical development of therapeutic vaccines for hepatitis c virus and hiv using our kbma technology platform applied to our attenuated listeria strain 
product candidates and development activities our attenuated listeria vaccine platform crs we have conducted preclinical development of a strain of proprietary attenuated listeria for use in treating liver metastases of certain cancers  including colorectal cancer 
preclinical experiments of our product candidate  crs  suggest that our listeria strain selectively stimulates an anti cancer immune response in the liver 
when administered intravenously to mice  crs is taken up by macrophages in the liver and induces a cascade of immune stimulating cytokines and chemokines 
this inflammatory response leads to the recruitment and activation of immune cells to the liver  such as natural killer cells that mediate anti tumor effects  and dendritic cells that prime long lasting immunity against the tumor 
we have conducted toxicology studies of crs in non human primates and filed an investigational new drug application  or ind  with the fda in late  which was approved in early we initiated a phase i clinical trial of crs in the united states in the second half of the phase i trial is an open label  dose escalation study designed to assess safety and maximum tolerated dose of our attenuated listeria strain  as well as to monitor biological activity associated with immune system activation 
the trial is being conducted at multiple investigational sites in the united states 

table of contents crs in collaboration with investigators at johns hopkins  we are conducting late stage preclinical studies of a therapeutic pancreatic cancer vaccine candidate  crs  using the same proprietary strain of attenuated listeria used in crs  but in this product application the strain is engineered to express mesothelin 
mesothelin is an antigen that is prevalently expressed in pancreatic and ovarian tumors  but not in normal pancreatic or ovarian tissue 
in clinical studies at johns hopkins  three pancreatic cancer patients vaccinated with an experimental  non listeria vaccine developed t cell responses against mesothelin  and those patients are alive and disease free more than seven years after their initial cancer diagnosis 
cytotoxic t cells isolated from these patients recognized and destroyed tumor cells in vitro  further validating mesothelin as a target in pancreatic cancers 
in december  we licensed certain rights to mesothelin from johns hopkins 
in december  we entered into an exclusive license with chugai pharmaceutical co  ltd  relating to the dna sequence of mesothelin in the field of cancer vaccines 
we expect to file an ind for crs with the fda in mid medi epha in april  we entered into an agreement with medimmune to co develop a novel immunotherapeutic vaccine for cancer 
this product candidate  medi epha  combines our attenuated listeria platform with medimmune s proprietary epha antigen  which is expressed in a number of solid tumor cancers 
according to a paper published on august  in clinical cancer research by researchers from the university of texas md anderson cancer center  elevated levels of epha have been linked to cancer progression and decreased patient survival in ovarian cancer patients 
epha is also overexpressed by other types of cancers  including breast  prostate and metastatic melanoma 
under the terms of the agreement  we conducted preclinical development activities in support of medimmune  who is now responsible for remaining preclinical development  clinical testing  manufacturing and commercialization of any product resulting from the collaboration 
ending in early  we received development funding from medimmune and may receive contingent milestone payments and royalties on future product sales 
in september  medimmune selected a lead candidate strain as a predicate to advanced preclinical testing 
kbma platform hepatitis c and hiv vaccines we believe that our kbma technology has the potential to be used to develop novel therapeutic vaccines for serious infectious diseases  such as hepatitis c and hiv 
hepatitis c establishes chronic infections in the liver  and can be treated with a combination of small molecule drugs and interferon  an immune activating protein 
however  current treatments are suboptimal because systemic interferon treatment is difficult for patients to tolerate and induces a flu like syndrome 
our approach is to utilize our kbma platform to produce killed but metabolically active strains of listeria 
we believe that these strains would take advantage of listeria s natural tropism  or biological affinity  to the liver and induce localized production of cytokines  notably including interferon  that  in combination with small molecule drugs  may lead to elimination of the hepatitis c virus 
we believe that our kbma platform will also allow us to engineer kbma listeria strains that express hepatitis c antigens in order to elicit a specific and long lasting t cell response against virally infected tissues 
we believe that this approach may be better tolerated and have a higher rate of efficacy than current immunotherapies 
we are also engaged in early preclinical research and development of therapeutic vaccine candidates to treat hiv using kbma listeria strains expressing hiv antigens  which may elicit specific and long lasting t cell responses against virally infected tissues 

table of contents anthrax vaccine in july  we were awarded a million grant from the nih to begin development of a prophylactic anthrax vaccine based on our kbma vaccine platform 
this award is shared with a consortium of researchers at the university of california at berkeley and the university of new mexico health sciences center  with cerus serving as the principal investigator 
exposure to the bacterium bacillus anthracis leads to a serious and life threatening infectious disease and has become a major concern due to its potential to be used as an agent for bioterrorism 
the only currently licensed human anthrax vaccine was developed in the late s and has limited efficacy 
we believe that an anthrax vaccine based on our kbma platform technology has the potential to offer greater potency than the current vaccine 
to date  we have demonstrated that a kbma anthrax vaccine has the ability to induce broad based immune responses and protect mice from developing anthrax after exposure to a usually lethal dose of anthrax spores 
tularemia vaccine in october  we announced that a consortium of which we are a member was awarded million from the niaid for the study of the basic biology of and development of a prophylactic vaccine against francisella tularensis  the bacterium that causes the infectious disease tularemia 
of the total award amount  we expect to receive million over a three year period 
tularemia  also known as rabbit fever  is a serious and life threatening infectious disease for which there is currently no effective human vaccine 
similar to anthrax  tularemia has emerged as a growing bioterrorism concern because of its high level of infectivity  ease of dissemination and substantial mortality rate 
our work with the consortium will center on the development of a prophylactic tularemia vaccine using our kbma technology platform  and we and our collaborators are currently constructing vaccine candidates 
we intend to leverage the experience and know how from our research and development efforts in prophylactic vaccines against anthrax and tularemia to develop therapeutic vaccines for other infectious diseases 
manufacturing and supply we have used  and intend to continue to use  third parties to manufacture and supply the inactivation compounds for the intercept blood system and immunotherapy product candidates for use in clinical trials and for commercialization 
we have no experience in manufacturing products for commercial purposes and have only limited manufacturing facilities capable of producing small lots of preclinical materials for our immunotherapy programs 
consequently  we are dependent on baxter for intercept blood system components and on contract manufacturers for the production of helinx compounds and immunotherapy materials for development and commercial purposes 
under our agreements with baxter  we are responsible for developing and delivering our proprietary compounds to baxter for incorporation into the final system configuration 
baxter is responsible for manufacturing or supplying the disposable units for the platelet and plasma systems  such as blood storage containers and related tubing  as well as any device associated with the inactivation process on a cost plus basis through and components through we have contracted with one manufacturing facility for the synthesis of amotosalen  an inactivation compound used in our platelet and plasma systems 
under this contract  we are not subject to minimum annual purchase requirements 
however  if specified quantities of amotosalen are not purchased in any year  we are required to pay a maintenance fee of up to  for such year 
we currently have a stock of compound sufficient to support the anticipated commercial demand for the platelet and plasma systems in europe 
we and our contract manufacturers purchase certain raw materials from a limited number of suppliers 
while we believe that there are alternative sources of supply for such materials  establishing additional or replacement suppliers for any of the raw materials  if required  may not be accomplished quickly and could 
table of contents involve significant additional costs 
any failure to obtain from alternative suppliers any of the materials used to manufacture our compounds  if required  would limit our ability to manufacture our compounds 
marketing  sales and distribution the market for the intercept blood system is dominated by a small number of blood collection organizations in the united states  western europe and japan  where various national blood transfusion services or red cross organizations collect  store and distribute virtually all of their respective nations blood and blood component supplies 
the largest european markets for our products are in england  germany and france 
in england  decisions on product adoption are centralized in the national blood service 
in germany  decisions on product adoption are expected to be on a blood center by blood center basis 
while obtaining ce marks allow us to sell the platelet and plasma systems to blood centers in germany  blood centers in germany must still obtain both local manufacturing approval and national marketing authorization from the paul ehrlich institute before being allowed to sell platelets and plasma units treated with the intercept blood system to transfusing hospitals and physicians 
to date  one blood center in germany has received such requisite approvals and authorizations for the platelet system 
in france  decisions on product adoption are expected to be on a region by region basis with national direction 
our ability to successfully commercialize our products will depend in part on the availability of adequate reimbursement for product costs and related treatment of blood components from governmental authorities and private health care insurers including health maintenance organizations  or hmos  which are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both the extent of coverage and the reimbursement rate for new tests and treatments 
national reimbursement rates for platelet pathogen inactivation must be set before we would expect broad commercial adoption of the platelet system in france 
national reimbursement rates for pathogen inactivated plasma units have been set in france  but need to be extended to include the intercept blood system before we would expect broad commercial adoption of the plasma system in france 
for logistical and financial reasons  the transfusion industry has not always integrated new technologies into their processes  even those technologies with the potential to improve the safety of the blood supply  such as the intercept blood system 
in addition  healthcare professionals may require further safety information or additional studies before adopting our products 
our products may require changes to our potential customers space and staffing requirements and require upfront investment in uva illuminators  disposable kit inventory and staff training 
even if our product candidates receive regulatory approval for commercial sale  blood centers  physicians  patients and healthcare payors may not believe that the benefits of using our products justify their additional cost 
furthermore  our products may be inappropriate for certain patients  which could reduce the potential market size 
there is some volume loss in the yield of blood products as a result of our pathogen inactivation process 
in addition  our process today is not fully compatible with the common practice of collecting two units of platelets from a single apheresis donor 
if the volumetric reduction of blood product leads to increased costs  or our process requires changes in blood center or clinical regimens  customers may not adopt our product 
in addition  our products do not inactivate all known pathogens  and the inability of our systems to inactivate certain pathogens may inhibit their acceptance 
prior to february  baxter had been responsible for the marketing  sales and distribution of the platelet system in the united states  europe and other regions not covered by the agreements with bioone 
baxter also had been responsible for the marketing  sales and distribution of the plasma system following marketing approval in europe and other countries  excluding north america  and the regions covered by the agreements with bioone 
as a consequence of the february agreement with baxter  we have established a wholly owned subsidiary  cerus europe bv  located in the netherlands and are building our own independent marketing and sales organization based in europe to market and sell the intercept blood system in europe and middle east 
we also have a small scientific affairs group that supports the commercialization efforts 

table of contents under our april agreement with medimmune  medimmune is responsible for development  sales and marketing of any products resulting from our collaboration 
we are solely responsible for the continued development  clinical trials  regulatory approval and subsequent marketing and sales of our immunotherapy product candidates that are not partnered 
it will take a long time for us to complete preclinical development  clinical trials and regulatory approval for one or more of our immunotherapy product candidates 
before we submit any applications for regulatory approval of these products  we expect to have a sales and marketing plan in place  which could include formation of internal sales and marketing functions  collaborating with one or more third parties with sales and marketing capabilities  or both 
competition we believe that the intercept blood system has certain competitive advantages over competing blood borne pathogen inactivation methods that are either on the market  or in development 
the intercept blood system is designed for use in blood centers on a distributed basis with single units of blood products  which allows for integration with current blood collection  processing and storage procedures 
competing products in development or currently on the market  such as solvent detergent treated plasma  use centralized processing that takes blood products away from the blood center 
in addition  some potential competitors utilize a pooling process prior to pathogen inactivation  which significantly increases the risk of cross contamination by pathogens that are not inactivated 
one potential competitor has initiated a phase iii clinical trial in france using a pathogen inactivation process for platelets 
other competitors are marketing pathogen inactivation products for plasma in europe 
there are no known competitors in the clinical development stage for pathogen inactivation of red blood cells 
in addition to direct competition from other pathogen inactivation methods  we encounter indirect competition from other approaches to blood safety  including methods of testing blood products for bacterial and viral pathogens 
we believe that the primary competitive factors in the market for pathogen inactivation of blood products will include the breadth and effectiveness of pathogen inactivation processes  ease of use  the scope and enforceability of patent or other proprietary rights  product value  product supply and marketing and sales capability 
in addition  the length of time required for products to be developed and to receive regulatory and  in some cases  reimbursement approval are also important competitive factors 
we believe that the intercept blood system will compete favorably with respect to these factors  although there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so 
the biopharmaceutical field is characterized by rapid and significant technological changes 
accordingly  our success will depend in part on our ability to respond quickly to medical and technological changes through the development and introduction of new products 
product development involves a high degree of risk  and there can be no assurance that our product development efforts will result in any commercially successful products 
we believe our approaches to cancer and infectious disease immunotherapy have certain competitive advantages over currently available treatments or those now in development 
however  the markets for treatments of cancer and infectious disease are intensely competitive and subject to rapid change 
many companies with significantly greater resources than ours have established products on the market  as well as promising product candidates in more advanced development stages than our programs 
our ability to bring to market products that achieve a significant degree of commercial success will be dependent on a number of factors  including their efficacy and safety as shown in human clinical trials relative to the standards of care then in place  our ability to receive regulatory approval to sell products in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions  our ability to scale up and manufacture at acceptable cost  the availability of reimbursement from managed care organizations  and our ability to establish distribution channels for our products 
patents  licenses and proprietary rights our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents  to protect trade secrets  to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights 

table of contents our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by  among other methods  filing united states and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology  inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business 
as of december   we owned approximately issued or allowed united states patents and approximately issued or allowed foreign patents 
our patents expire at various dates between and in addition  we have pending united states patent applications and have filed corresponding patent applications under the patent cooperation treaty 
we have a license from baxter to united states and foreign patents relating to the intercept blood system and have licenses to united states and foreign patents relating to our immunotherapy programs 
proprietary rights relating to our planned and potential products will be protected from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that they are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
there can be no assurance that any patents owned by or licensed to us will afford protection against competitors or that any pending patent applications now or hereafter filed by  or licensed to  us will result in patents being issued 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
government regulation we and our products are comprehensively regulated in the united states by the fda and  in some instances  by state and local governments  and by comparable governmental authorities in other countries 
our european investigational plan has been based on the intercept blood system being categorized as class iii drug device combinations under the medical device directives  or mdd of the european union 
the european union requires that medical devices affix the ce mark  an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance with the mdd 
the intercept blood system for platelets received the ce mark in october the intercept blood system for plasma received the ce mark in november a separate ce mark certification must be received for the red blood cell system to be sold in the european union 
several european countries require additional in country studies to support an approval to market the products in such countries 
the fda regulates drugs  medical devices and biologics under the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act and other laws  including  in the case of biologics  the public health service act 
these laws and implementing regulations govern  among other things  the development  testing  manufacturing  record keeping  storage  labeling  advertising  promotion and pre market clearance or approval of products subject to regulation 
the steps required before a medical device or biologic may be approved for marketing in the united states pursuant to a pre market approval application  or pma  or a biologics license application  or bla  respectively  generally include i preclinical laboratory and animal tests  ii submission to the fda of an investigational device exemption for medical devices or an ind application for drugs or biologics for human clinical testing  which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin  iii appropriate tests to show the product s safety  iv adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the product s safety and efficacy for its intended indications  v submission to the fda of a pma or bla  as appropriate  and vi fda review of the pma or bla in order to determine  among other things  whether the product is safe and effective for its intended uses 
in addition  the fda inspects the facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practice or quality system regulation requirements is satisfactory 
the fda will require a pma for each of the systems for platelets  plasma and red blood cells  and a bla for vaccines for cancer and infectious diseases 
in addition  the fda will require site specific licenses from our united states based blood center customers before they can engage in interstate transport of blood components processed using our pathogen inactivation systems  and a delay in obtaining these licenses would adversely impact our ability to sell products in the united states 
the fda regulates the intercept blood system as a biological medical device 
the fda center for biologics evaluation and research  or cber  is principally responsible for regulating the intercept blood system 
in addition to regulating our product  cber also regulates the blood collection centers and the blood products they prepare using our medical device 

table of contents before the fda determines whether to approve our blood safety products  we expect our approval applications to be reviewed by the blood products advisory committee  or bpac  an advisory committee convened by and reporting to the fda 
bpac will make a recommendation to the fda for  or against  approval 
before a medical device may be marketed in the united states  the fda must approve a pre market approval application for the product 
baxter used a modular process for our pma application for the platelet system in the united states  which we have followed since assuming responsibility for regulatory activities in the us under terms of the february and agreements 
the content  order and submission timing of the modules must be approved by the fda  and a modular pma application cannot be approved until all modules have been submitted to  reviewed by and accepted by the fda 
in addition to the regulatory requirements applicable to the intercept blood system  there are regulatory requirements applicable to our prospective customers  the blood centers that process and distribute blood and blood products 
blood centers and others will likely be required to obtain approved license supplements from the fda before using the intercept blood system 
there can be no assurance that any blood centers will be able to obtain the required licenses on a timely basis  or at all 
to support applications for regulatory approval to market the intercept blood system  we conduct various types of studies  including toxicology studies to evaluate product safety  laboratory and animal studies to evaluate product effectiveness and human clinical trials to evaluate the safety  tolerability and effectiveness of treated blood components 
we believe that  in deciding whether the intercept blood system is safe and effective  regulatory authorities are likely to take into account whether it adversely affects the therapeutic efficacy of blood components as compared to the therapeutic efficacy of blood components not treated with the system  and regulatory authorities will weigh the system s safety  including potential toxicities of the inactivation compounds  and other risks against the benefits of using the system in a blood supply that has become safer 
we have conducted many toxicology studies designed to demonstrate the intercept blood system s safety 
there can be no assurance that regulatory authorities will not require further toxicology or other studies of our products 
based on discussions with the fda and european regulatory authorities  we believe that data from human clinical studies is required to demonstrate the safety of treated blood components and their therapeutic comparability to untreated blood components  but that only data from laboratory and animal studies  not data from human clinical studies  will be required to demonstrate the system s efficacy in inactivating pathogens 
in light of these criteria  our clinical trial programs for the intercept blood system consists of studies that differ from typical phase i  phase ii and phase iii clinical studies 
many of the intercept blood system preclinical and clinical studies have been conducted using prototype system disposables and devices 
we plan to perform laboratory studies to demonstrate equivalency between the prototype and the commercial configuration 
we cannot be certain that these studies will be successful or the fda will not require additional studies  which could delay commercialization 
if we decide to seek fda approval of the platelet system for use in treating pooled random donor platelets  additional clinical studies will be required 
in addition  there currently are three principal manufacturers of automated apheresis collection equipment  including baxter 
the equipment of each manufacturer collects platelets into plastic disposables designed for that equipment  thus  a pathogen inactivation system designed for disposables used by one manufacturer will not necessarily be compatible with other manufacturers collection equipment 
if we elect to prioritize regulatory efforts in the united states  we may initially seek fda approval of the platelet system configured for baxter s apheresis collection equipment 
if we determine that compatibility with other equipment is desirable  additional processing procedures and system configurations will need to be developed 
we believe that the fda will also require supplemental clinical data before approving our system for use with platelets collected using other equipment 
cancer immunotherapies and vaccines for infectious diseases are regulated by cber 
cerus has filed one ind for which approval was granted in early  and is planning to file one or more applications for 
table of contents immunotherapies in the future 
toxicology studies will be required 
completion of such studies could result in findings that limit the feasibility of one or more particular immunotherapy development programs 
there is no assurance at this time that the fda will accept the design of the planned clinical protocols until pre ind meetings are held 
for some immunotherapies  including crs  submission to the recombinant dna advisory committee  or rac  of the nih will be necessary 
the rac may make recommendations that delay initiation of clinical trials 
a series of clinical studies will be necessary to gain sufficient information to submit a bla to the fda 
failure of pivotal clinical trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy will preclude moving forward in clinical development or filing of the associated bla for a product candidate 
during the review process for the bla  it is expected that the fda will request review by an advisory committee  which will make recommendations for or against approval 
there are a number of companies pursuing development of cancer immunotherapies 
failure of these types of approaches to demonstrate sufficient efficacy or safety to gain regulatory approval could influence the regulatory process for our product candidates 
health care reimbursement and reform the future revenue and profitability of biopharmaceutical and related companies as well as the availability of capital to such companies may be affected by the continuing efforts of the united states and foreign governments and third party payors to contain or reduce costs of health care through various means 
in the united states  given federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of health care  it is likely that the united states congress and state legislatures will continue to focus on health care reform and the cost of pharmaceuticals and on the reform of the medicare and medicaid systems 
our ability to commercialize our products successfully will depend in part on the extent to which appropriate reimbursement levels for the cost of the products and related treatment are obtained from governmental authorities  private health insurers and other organizations  such as hmos 
third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for pharmaceuticals  medical devices and services 
the trend toward managed health care in the united states and other countries and the concurrent growth of organizations such as hmos  which could control or significantly influence the purchase of health care services and products  as well as legislative proposals to reform health care or reduce government insurance programs  may all affect the prices for our products 
employees as of december   we had employees  of whom were engaged in research and development and in selling  general  and administrative activities 
of the employees engaged in selling  general  and administrative activities  employees were employed by our european subsidiary  cerus europe bv none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements  and we believe that our relationship with our employees is good

some potential customers have indicated that further safety information or additional studies would be required before adopting our products

in addition  our platelet system process today is not fully compatible with the common practice of collecting two units of platelets from a single apheresis donor 
if the volumetric reduction of blood product leads to increased costs  or our process requires changes in blood center or clinical regimens  customers may not adopt our platelet system product 
our products do not inactivate all known pathogens  and the inability of our systems to inactivate certain pathogens may limit their acceptance 
in addition  our products may not demonstrate economic value sufficient to offset their price  imposing a financial burden on the healthcare system that may limit market acceptance 
for logistical and financial reasons  the transfusion industry has not always integrated new technologies into their processes  even those with the potential to improve the safety of the blood supply  such as the intercept blood system 
our products may require significant changes to our potential customers blood component collection methods  space and staffing requirements and require upfront investment in uva illuminators  disposable kit inventory and staff training 
even if our product candidates receive regulatory approval for commercial sale  blood centers  physicians  patients and healthcare payors may not believe that the benefits of using the intercept blood system justify their additional cost 
if customers experience operational or technical problems with the use of intercept blood system products  market acceptance may be reduced 
for example  if adverse events arise from incomplete inactivation of pathogens  improper processing or user error  or if testing of intercept blood system treated blood samples fails to reliably confirm pathogen inactivation  whether or not directly attributable to a shortcoming of the intercept blood system  customers may refrain from purchasing the products 
market acceptance of our products may also be affected by the availability of reimbursement from governments  managed care payors  such as insurance companies  or other third parties 
in many cases  due to the structure of the blood products industry  we will have little control over reimbursement discussions  which generally occur between blood centers and national or regional ministries of health and private payors 
for example  while the platelet system has been approved in france for use by blood centers in treating platelets  commercial adoption has been delayed pending determination of national reimbursement rates for pathogen inactivated platelets 
we may be required to seek explicit reimbursement in european countries for our plasma system  even though other competing pathogen inactivation products for plasma have been approved and are being reimbursed in europe presently 
it is difficult to predict the reimbursement status of newly approved  novel medical device or biopharmaceutical products 
in certain foreign markets  governments have issued regulations relating to the pricing and profitability of medical products and medical products companies 
there also have been proposals in the united states  at both the federal and state government level  to implement such controls 

table of contents the widespread adoption of managed care in the united states has also placed pressure on the pricing of medical products 
these pressures can be expected to continue and may limit the prices we can obtain for our products 
we may be required to reduce the sales price for our products in order to make them economically attractive to our customers and to governmental and private payors  which would reduce and may eliminate our gross profit on sales 
pricing levels may differ widely from country to country  depending on economic  social and industry practices specific to each country 
at our present low unit sales levels of the platelet and plasma systems  our costs to manufacture and sell the systems are in excess of revenue 
we may be unable to increase sales to a level sufficient to generate profit contribution 
we believe that future product sales in europe and other regions may be negatively affected because we do not have fda approval for any of our products  nor are we prioritizing seeking such approval 
if the intercept blood system products fail to achieve market acceptance  we may never become profitable 
in addition  failure to advance the red blood cell system toward regulatory approval and commercialization may have a negative impact on customers willingness to adopt the platelet and plasma systems  which could prevent us from achieving profitability 
deferring pursuit of regulatory approval of the intercept blood system in the united states due to strategic priorities favoring europe may have adverse consequences on market acceptance of the intercept blood system globally 
the market for the intercept blood system is highly concentrated with few customers  including often dominant regional or national blood collection entities 
even if our products receive regulatory approval and reimbursement is available  failure to properly market  price or sell our products to any of these large customers could significantly diminish potential product revenue in those geographies 
the market for our pathogen inactivation systems in the united states is highly concentrated  dominated by a small number of blood collection organizations 
in many countries in western europe and in japan  various national blood transfusion services or red cross organizations collect  store and distribute virtually all of their respective nation s blood and blood components supply 
in europe  the largest markets for our products are in england  germany and france 
decisions on product adoption in england are centralized with the national blood service  where general cost containment pressures have delayed consideration of the intercept blood system to date 
in germany  decisions on product adoption and subsequent reimbursement are expected to be on a blood center by blood center basis  but depend on both local and centralized regulatory approvals 
while the platelet system has received in country regulatory approval in france  adoption has been delayed in the absence of national reimbursement rates for pathogen inactivated platelets 
in country regulatory approval in france for the plasma system was obtained in early however  adoption may be delayed until the existing national reimbursement rates for pathogen inactivated plasma are extended to the intercept plasma system 
the japanese red cross controls a significant majority of blood transfusions in japan 
if approvals are not obtained to market our products in these countries  or if the products are not adopted in these countries  our potential product revenue will be significantly decreased 
our products  blood products treated with the intercept blood system and we are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign authorities 
our products under development  and anticipated future products  are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by local  state and federal regulatory authorities in the united states and by foreign regulatory bodies 
these regulations are wide ranging and govern  among other things development  testing  manufacturing  labeling  storage  pre market clearance or approval  
table of contents sales and distribution  use standards and documentation  post launch surveillance  quality  advertising and promotion  and reimbursement 
the fda and other agencies in the united states and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the manufacturing and marketing of products such as those we are developing 
the process of obtaining fda and other required regulatory approvals is long  expensive and uncertain  and typically takes a number of years  depending on the type  complexity and novelty of the product 
we may encounter significant delays or excessive costs in our efforts to secure necessary approvals or licenses  or we may not be successful at all 
before the fda determines whether to approve the intercept blood system products  we expect our approval applications to be reviewed by the bpac 
bpac would then make a recommendation to the fda for  or against  approval 
even if bpac were to recommend approval of one or more of our products  the fda would not necessarily approve those products 
if bpac were to recommend against approval of one or more of our products  it is likely that the fda would not approve those products 
before entering human clinical trials  product candidates in our immunotherapy programs beyond crs likely will be subject to review by the rac of the nih  which could delay initiation of clinical trials 
if our product candidates receive approval for commercial sale  their marketing and manufacturing will be subject to continuing fda and other regulatory requirements  such as requirements to comply with good manufacturing practice and iso  a quality management system standard applicable to the products we sell in europe 
we were found to be in compliance with iso quality management system requirements in an audit conducted by european union regulators in late the failure to comply with these requirements on an ongoing basis could result in delaying or precluding commercialization efforts in certain geographies  including the united states  and could result in enforcement action  which could harm our business 
gaining fda approval for our platelet and plasma products would require additional investment and time  because the current manufacturing sites we rely upon for producing the platelet and plasma system products for european distribution are not fda qualified facilities 
regulatory authorities may also require post marketing testing  which can involve significant expense 
governments or regulatory authorities may impose new regulations or other changes that could further delay or preclude regulatory approval of our potential products 
we cannot predict the impact of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action 
distribution of our products outside the united states also is subject to extensive government regulation 
these regulations vary by country  including the requirements for approvals or clearance to market  the time required for regulatory review and the sanctions imposed for violations 
in some countries  we may be required to register as a medical device manufacturer  even though we outsource manufacturing to third parties 
in addition  countries outside the european union may require clinical data submissions  registration packages  import licenses or other documentation with which we have no familiarity 
we will be required to obtain a ce mark extension from european union regulators for our platelet system  originally obtained by baxter in  by may and every five years thereafter 
in addition to european union level approval  we must obtain regulatory and reimbursement approvals in some individual european countries  including france  germany and england  to market our products 
in addition  our customers in many 
table of contents countries must obtain regulatory approval to sell blood components treated with the intercept blood system 
the level of additional product testing varies by country  but could take a long time to complete 
failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or any other failure to comply with regulatory requirements could result in lost product sales and profitability 
to support our requests for regulatory approval to market our product candidates  we have conducted and intend to conduct various types of studies including toxicology studies to evaluate product safety  laboratory and animal studies to evaluate product effectiveness  human clinical trials to evaluate the safety  tolerability and effectiveness of treated blood components or immunotherapies  and manufacturing and stability studies 
we have conducted many toxicology studies to demonstrate the intercept platelet and plasma systems safety  and we have conducted and plan to conduct toxicology studies for the intercept red blood cell system and our vaccine candidates throughout the product development process 
at any time  the fda and other regulatory authorities may require further toxicology or other studies to further demonstrate our products safety  which could delay commercialization 
in addition  the fda or foreign regulatory authorities may alter guidance at any time as to what constitutes acceptable clinical trial endpoints or trial design  which may necessitate our having to redesign our product candidates or proposed clinical trials and cause us to incur substantial additional expense or time in attempting to gain regulatory approval 
we believe the fda and other regulatory authorities are likely to weigh the potential risks of using our pathogen inactivation products against the incremental benefits  which may be less compelling in light of improved safety in the blood supply 
with respect to an additional phase iii trial of the platelet system in the united states  we expect the fda to require us to demonstrate a very low level of potential side effects 
trials of this type may be too large and expensive to be practical 
preclinical testing and clinical trials involving our immunotherapy product candidates are long  expensive and uncertain processes 
we have only recently begun phase i human clinical testing of our listeria platform technology and we have not yet begun testing of our kbma platform technology in humans 
preclinical results in animals and in vitro testing we have conducted to date with our two immunotherapy platform technologies may not translate to demonstration of safety and efficacy in human clinical trials 
a number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry  including biotechnology companies  have suffered significant setbacks in advancing stages of clinical trials  even after promising results in earlier preclinical and clinical trials 
in addition  regulators and investigators may impose more stringent  time consuming and expensive clinical trial requirements than we might otherwise choose to pursue as a precondition to proceeding with clinical testing 
it may take us or our collaborators several years to complete this testing  and failure can occur at any stage of the process 
we do not know whether we or our collaborators will begin and conduct planned clinical trials on schedule  if at all 
significant delays in clinical testing could materially impact our clinical trials 
we also do not know whether planned clinical trials will need to be revamped or will be completed on schedule  if at all 
criteria for regulatory approval in cancer and infectious disease indications are evolving with competitive advances in the standard of care against which new product candidates are judged  as well as with changing market needs and reimbursement levels 
clinical trial design  including enrollment criteria  endpoints  and anticipated label claims are thus subject to change  even if original objectives are being met 
in addition to the reasons stated above  clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons  including delays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a study  delays in reaching agreement on acceptable clinical study agreement terms with prospective clinical sites  delays in obtaining institutional review board approval to conduct a study at a prospective clinical site and delays in recruiting subjects to participate in a study 
we do not know whether any clinical trials will result in marketable products 
typically  there is a high rate of failure for product candidates in preclinical and 
table of contents clinical trials and product candidates emerging from any successful trials would not reach the market for several years 
regulatory delays can also materially impact our product development costs 
if we experience delays in testing or approvals  our product development costs will increase 
for example  we may need to repeat clinical trials to address regulatory or clinical questions 
we may also need to make additional payments to third party investigators and organizations to retain their services 
if the delays are significant  our financial results and the commercial prospects for our product candidates will be harmed  and our ability to become profitable will be delayed 
regulatory agencies may limit the uses  or indications  for which any of our products are approved 
for example  we believe that the intercept blood system products will be able to claim the inactivation of particular pathogens only to the extent we have laboratory or animal data to support such claims 
after regulatory approval for the initial indications  further clinical trials may be necessary to gain approval for the use of the product for additional indications 
in addition to the regulatory requirements applicable to us and to our products  there are regulatory requirements applicable to our prospective customers of intercept blood system products  the blood centers that process and distribute blood and blood products 
blood centers and others will likely be required to obtain approved license supplements from the fda or european regulatory authorities before making available blood products processed with our pathogen inactivation systems to hospitals and transfusing physicians 
this requirement or regulators delays in approving these supplements may deter some blood centers from using our products 
blood centers that do submit supplements may face disapproval or delays in approval that could provide further delay or deter them from using our products 
the regulatory impact on potential customers could slow or limit the potential sales of our products 
if our preclinical and clinical data are not considered sufficient by regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval  we will be unable to commercialize our products and generate revenue 
our red blood cell system requires extensive additional testing and development 
except for the intercept platelet and plasma systems  which have received ce mark approval and regulatory approval in certain countries in europe  we have no products that have received regulatory approval for commercial sale and are being marketed 
our product candidates are in various stages of development  and we face the risks of failure inherent in developing medical devices and biotechnology products based on new technologies 
our product candidates must satisfy rigorous standards of safety and efficacy and we must adhere to quality standards regarding manufacturing and customer facing business processes before the fda and international regulatory authorities can approve them for commercial use 
we must provide the fda and international regulatory authorities with preclinical  clinical and manufacturing data that demonstrate our products are safe  effective and in compliance with government regulations before the products can be approved for commercial sale 
in  the platelet system received ce mark approval in europe 
we will need to complete validation studies and obtain regulatory and reimbursement approvals in certain european countries before we can market our products in those countries 
we expect that further randomized clinical trials funded by third parties will be conducted in some european countries  such as the netherlands 
we also expect to conduct many smaller scale experience trials with prospective customers in a number of european countries 
we expect that decisions to adopt the platelet system may be deferred until completion of the additional trials and experience studies in europe 
in certain countries  including germany and switzerland  the system must be approved for purchase or use by a specific governmental or non governmental entity or entities  such as the paul ehrlich institute in germany 
in france  the platelet system has been approved for use by blood centers in treating platelets  however  we do not expect to sell the platelet system broadly to commercial customers until national reimbursement rates for pathogen inactivated platelets treated with the intercept platelet system are set 

table of contents we completed our phase iii clinical trial of the platelet system in the united states in march and have submitted data from this trial  along with several other modules of our pre market approval application  to the fda 
based on discussions with the fda  we performed an additional blinded analysis of the clinical trial data  under the direction of an independent expert physician panel  to determine if apparent differences between treatment groups in the category of pulmonary adverse events reported in the study were attributable to inconsistent event reporting 
the reassessment of primary patient records by the expert physician panel showed no statistically significant differences between groups 
this reassessment differed from the earlier analysis of adverse events that was based on clinical trial case report forms  which showed statistically significant differences in specific pulmonary events 
we submitted a report of the analysis to the fda for review 
the report included conclusions from the expert physician panel 
based upon further discussions with the fda following submission of that report  we continue to expect that the fda will require an additional  significantly larger phase iii clinical trial to evaluate the hemostatic efficacy and safety of the platelet system  using the company s final commercial product design  as compared to conventional platelets 
we also understand that our reassessment of our previously completed phase iii clinical trial data will not be sufficient to address the apparent differences observed in that trial between the treatment groups in the category of pulmonary adverse events  and that data on such events would need to be gathered in the additional phase iii trial 
the dimensions of such a phase iii trial may be prohibitively large due either to prospective cost  logistics or both 
the additional phase iii clinical trial would need to be completed and data from the trial submitted to the fda before we could complete our regulatory submission 
the fda may not find the data from any additional clinical trials to be acceptable for approval 
before we begin an additional clinical trial  we will need to gain concurrence with the fda on our trial design 
we may not be able to reach concurrence on the size  scope or design of the study 
we have completed phase iiia  phase iiib and phase iiic clinical trials of the plasma system  in the united states  reports for which were filed with the fda during we obtained a ce mark approval in europe of the plasma system in november we have not submitted any applications for regulatory approval of the plasma system in the united states or any other regions other than europe 
in some countries  including several in europe  we may be required to perform additional clinical studies using the commercial configuration of the system in order to obtain regulatory approval 
as a result of the termination of phase iii clinical trials of our red blood cell system due to the detection of antibody reactivity to red blood cells treated with the intercept red blood cell system in two patients  we have been conducting additional research activities on our red blood cell system to determine if the system can be reconfigured to reduce the potential for antibody reactivity to treated red blood cells 
based upon an internal evaluation of the results to date from these additional research activities and after consulting with regulatory authorities  we initiated a new phase i trial in in the united states using a modified red blood cell system before potentially progressing to later stage clinical trials 
we are utilizing a manual processing system in the phase i trial  which system is not in a commercially feasible form 
a number of trial design  process and product design issues that could impact efficacy  regulatory approval and market acceptance will need to be resolved prior to the initiation of further clinical trials and while those clinical trials are being conducted  including determining the appropriate design of additional phase i or subsequent phase ii clinical trials  if deemed necessary  and phase iii clinical trials  and developing a commercially feasible red blood cell system  including disposables  hardware and software for implementing the process in blood collection centers 
these development initiatives may be costly and time consuming 
even if the project proceeds on course  we would not expect to initiate a phase iii trial for our red blood cell system prior to late a delay in completing such activities could result in a delay in the timely progression to later stage trials 
if we are unsuccessful in advancing a modified red blood cell system through clinical trials  resolving process and product design issues or in obtaining subsequent regulatory approvals and acceptable reimbursement rates  we may never realize a return on our development expenses incurred to date in the red blood cell system program 
clinical trials in particular are expensive and have a high risk of failure 
any of our product candidates may fail in the testing phase or may not achieve results sufficient to attain market acceptance  which could prevent us from achieving profitability 

table of contents it may take us several years to complete our clinical testing  and failure can occur at any stage of testing 
enrollment criteria for certain of our clinical trials may be quite narrow 
consequently  we may be unable to recruit suitable patients into the trial on a timely basis  if at all 
we cannot rely on interim results of trials to predict their final results  and acceptable results in early trials might not be repeated in later trials 
any trial may fail to produce results satisfactory to the fda or foreign regulatory authorities 
in addition  preclinical and clinical data can be interpreted in different ways  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
negative or inconclusive results from a preclinical study or clinical trial or adverse medical events during a clinical trial could cause a preclinical study or clinical trial to be repeated  require other studies to be performed or cause a program to be terminated  even if other studies or trials relating to a program are successful 
we have very limited experience in marketing and sales  or in managing a commercial operation in europe 
we can no longer rely upon baxter for sales  marketing  distribution and regulatory support of the intercept blood system products and have formed a new subsidiary in europe to assume such responsibilities 
we have limited experience in managing regulatory affairs  particularly with foreign authorities 
upon reaching agreements with baxter in february  we became fully responsible for sales  marketing and distribution support of the intercept blood system worldwide  except in those asian territories covered by our agreements with bioone for the platelet and plasma systems 
as a consequence  we will no longer be able to rely upon baxter for sales  marketing and distribution support of the intercept blood system 
further  the february agreements required that baxter provide regulatory support for the intercept blood system only through the end of  and as a result  we can no longer rely on such support from baxter 
we have been particularly dependent on baxter in europe  where the platelet system and  more recently  the plasma system  have been approved for sale in certain countries 
if we fail in our efforts to develop such internal competencies or establish acceptable relationships with third parties on a timely basis  our attempts to commercialize the intercept blood system may be irreparably harmed 
we must develop  build and manage marketing  sales  distribution  customer service and back office functions necessary to support commercialization of the intercept blood system in europe 
historically  we have had a small scientific affairs group that has helped support baxter s european sales and marketing organization  however  we did not maintain our own independent sales and marketing organization 
we may be unable to maintain existing customer relationships established by baxter as we take on responsibility for sales  marketing and customer service 
beginning in early  we began to recruit a small european organization dedicated primarily to selling and marketing the platelet system and more recently  the plasma system  in europe 
we may be unable to recruit suitable sales  marketing  regulatory  and quality assurance personnel on a timely basis  if at all 
we also need to continue developing distribution  customer service  and back office capabilities either internally or by contracting with third parties  which we may be unable to accomplish on a timely or maintain on an affordable basis 
in addition to adding sales and marketing capabilities  we have needed to develop appropriate inventory and logistics management  receivables and collections  foreign exchange  risk management  human resources  information and quality systems capabilities 
generally  such capabilities must be built in compliance with european standards and practices  with which we have little experience 
we also have had to develop customer service capabilities to insure uninterrupted supply  timely calibration and servicing of uva illuminators  and appropriate and timely resolution of customer complaints 
we may be unable to operate a european organization effectively and efficiently  even after cerus europe bv is fully staffed 
developing sales  marketing and operational capabilities ourselves will increase our costs and may delay commercialization of our pathogen inactivation systems 
we must develop regulatory capabilities for clinical stage and phase iv trials involving the intercept blood system globally 
following our february agreements with baxter  we have taken on worldwide responsibility for regulatory activities regarding the intercept blood system  
table of contents except in territories covered by our agreement with bioone for the platelet and plasma systems  provided that baxter remained as the registrant or applicant under european registrations and applications for a transition period in we will need to complete the transition from baxter  where we must gain regulatory approval to switch product labels to our brand 
failure to do so may slow the rate of sales of the platelet system or delay the launch of our plasma system 
we need additional resources to support regulatory activities and post approval trials relating to these products 
we may not have adequate internal resources and capabilities to manage phase iv and post approval trials and to respond appropriately to possible customer complaints or required regulatory reporting of adverse events arising from the use of the platelet system 
we will need to increase our regulatory and trial management resources or contract with independent regulatory consultants  which we may be unable to do on a timely basis 
adding regulatory and trial management resources will result in increased costs and may potentially delay regulatory filings 
delays or inabilities to complete regulatory filings and obtain approvals will also delay or prevent us from being able to recognize sales of our products and attaining profitability 
we will continue to rely on baxter for manufacturing and supplying components of our platelet and plasma systems for a limited period of time 
over a longer period  we will need to identify  select and qualify third party sources of supply for the intercept blood system  including the intercept red blood cell system 
we rely on third parties for manufacturing and supplying components of our platelet and plasma systems 
under the terms of our agreements  baxter is currently responsible for manufacturing and supplying illuminators and disposable kits associated with the platelet and plasma systems for commercial use through and certain components of the platelet and plasma systems through we will also be dependent on baxter to transfer know how relevant to the intercept blood system  however  certain of baxter s materials  manufacturing processes and methods are proprietary to baxter 
we may be unable to establish alternate sources of supply to baxter without having to redesign certain elements of the platelet and plasma systems 
such redesign may be costly  time consuming and require further regulatory review  which would delay our ability to commercialize the platelet and plasma systems 
if baxter fails to manufacture an adequate supply of components or devices within quality specifications  we may be unable to supply products to our customers 
baxter is not obligated to provide support for development and testing of improvements or changes we may make to the intercept blood system 
we may be unable to identify  select  and qualify such manufacturers or those third parties able to provide support for development and testing activities on a timely basis or enter into contracts with them on reasonable terms  if at all 
any delay in the availability of devices or components from baxter could delay further regulatory approvals  market introduction and subsequent sales of the systems 
moreover  the inclusion of components manufactured by others could require us to seek new approvals from regulatory authorities  which could result in delays in product delivery 
we may not receive any such required regulatory approvals 
baxter manufactures our platelet and plasma systems in facilities that are not fda approved 
our agreements do not require baxter to validate these manufacturing facilities with the fda 
in order to be sold in the united states  our systems would be required to be manufactured in an fda approved facility 
fda validation of a manufacturing facility  whether owned by baxter or by another party  will be costly and time consuming 
baxter has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its transfusion therapies business unit and  under that agreement  the buyer will assume baxter s manufacturing obligations to cerus 
on october   baxter announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to sell its transfusion therapies business  the unit of baxter that has performed many of the manufacturing and supply chain activities related to our relationship with baxter  to a new company formed by an investment group led by texas pacific group 
subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions  baxter has informed us that it expects the transaction to close within the first quarter of we have been informed by baxter that the new company will assume baxter s obligations to us under the manufacturing agreement 
however  the new company may fail to manufacture an adequate supply of 
table of contents components or devices of the intercept blood system  which would subject us to the risks described above 
certain components of the intercept blood system are currently manufactured or assembled at facilities not within the transfusion therapies business unit 
baxter and or the new company will continue to be obligated to supply illuminators and disposable kits associated with the platelet and plasma systems to us generally through and for certain components through failure to supply an adequate supply of components or devices of the intercept blood system  would subject us to the risks described above 
in addition  because the components of the intercept blood system are manufactured and assembled at multiple facilities owned by both baxter and the new company leading up to final assembly  baxter and the new company will remain interdependent with respect to the intercept blood system supply chain 
baxter and the new company may fail to coordinate or meet interdependent supply chain obligations  leading to a failure to manufacture an adequate supply of components or devices of the intercept blood system  which would also subject us to the risks described above 
we will be required to identify and enter into agreements with third parties to manufacture the intercept blood system products and related blood component storage solutions 
baxter s manufacturing responsibilities for illuminators and disposable kits associated with the platelet and plasma systems in general extend through and for certain components of the platelet and plasma systems through  after which we will assume manufacturing responsibilities 
except for very limited manufacturing of disposable components  baxter is no longer obligated to provide manufacturing services related to the red blood cell system 
we will need to identify parties to provide those manufacturing services related to our red blood cell system 
it may be difficult to enter into these types of agreements on reasonable terms 
in particular  it will be time consuming for other manufacturers to develop the capability to manufacture the intercept blood system products and blood component storage solutions economically and to gain regulatory approval to do so for commercial use 
we may be unable to identify and contract with manufacturers that can make our products cost effectively  which would delay our efforts to commercialize our products 
our potential remedies against baxter may be inadequate in assuring that baxter meets its contractual obligations 
in the event of a failure by baxter to perform its obligations to supply components of the intercept blood system to us  damages recoverable by us may be insufficient to compensate us for the full loss of business opportunity 
our supply agreement with baxter contains limitations on incidental and consequential damages that we may recover 
baxter s potential liability in the event of non performance may not be sufficient to compel baxter to continue to act in conformity with our agreements 
the platelet system is not compatible with some commercial platelet collection methods and platforms and platelet storage solutions manufactured by others 
the equipment and materials used to collect platelets vary by manufacturer and by geographic region 
platelets may be collected from a single donor by apheresis using an automated collection machine 
apheresis devices currently used in the united states and european markets differ  among other characteristics  by in their ability to collect platelets in reduced volumes of plasma 
platelet concentrates may also be prepared from whole blood by pooling together platelets from multiple donors 
there are two commonly used methods for preparing whole blood platelets the buffy coat method  which is used extensively in europe and canada  and the pooled random donor method  which is used in the united states and to a more limited extent in europe 
our system for platelets is designed to work with platelets collected using a proprietary platelet storage solution  called intersol  manufactured by baxter 
for platelets collected by apheresis  the intercept platelet system is most compatible with baxter s apheresis platelet collection system  because it facilitates the use of intersol 
for platelets prepared from whole blood  our platelet system is most compatible with the buffy coat collection method  again because this method facilitates the use of intersol as an additive solution to the platelet 
table of contents concentrate 
as a result  we have conducted most of our clinical studies using either baxter s equipment or buffy coat platelets 
more recently  we have begun conducting studies in europe supporting the use of the platelet system in combination with other collection and preparation platforms 
in order to address the entire market in the united states  we would need to develop and test additional configurations of the intercept platelet system 
our efforts to develop the platelet system to date have focused almost entirely on apheresis platelets collected on baxter s automated collection platform 
we estimate that the majority of platelets used in the united states are collected by apheresis  though a significant minority is prepared from pooled random donor platelets derived from whole blood collections 
we may be required to make our systems compatible with random donor platelets 
in order to develop a platelet pathogen inactivation system compatible with random donor platelets  we would need to perform additional product development and testing  including additional clinical trials 
these development activities would increase our costs significantly  and may not be successful 
baxter has committed to us to make intersol collection and pooling products and conversion kits available to customers 
however  baxter may not make such products or its apheresis collection system available for sale in certain countries and has elected to discontinue sales efforts for its apheresis collection system in japan 
other manufacturers supplying blood component collection platforms to the market may resist our efforts to make the intercept blood system compatible with their platforms 
making our platelet system readily compatible with the haemonetics apheresis collection system will require certain changes in the haemonetics device  and there can be no assurance that haemonetics will undertake this effort on a timely basis or be commercially successful 
gambro  inc  or gambro  another major supplier of automated platelet collection systems  is conducting clinical trials of its own system for pathogen inactivation of platelets 
for competitive reasons  gambro may have little or no incentive to make its apheresis collection system compatible with our platelet system 
attaining compatibility with collection platforms manufactured by others would require adaptations to either our platelet system or to the collection platforms  which may be difficult to engineer  expensive to implement and test  require additional clinical trials  cause delays in regulatory approval and or be commercially unattractive to pursue 
these development activities will increase our costs significantly  and may not be successful 
market acceptance of the platelet system may be delayed until the system receives regulatory approval for use on such other equipment 
because the intercept blood system products have not been manufactured on more than a limited commercial scale  we face manufacturing uncertainties that could limit their commercialization 
if our third party manufacturers fail to produce our products or compounds satisfactorily and in sufficient quantities  we may incur delays  shortfalls and additional expenses  which may in turn result in permanent harm to our customer relations 
the intercept blood system products  including many of the components  have been manufactured on a commercial scale on only a limited basis 
baxter relies on third parties to manufacture and assemble some of the platelet and plasma system components  many of which are customized and have not been manufactured on a commercial scale 
baxter has produced some pathogen inactivation systems in modest commercial quantities  but may not be able to manufacture and assemble other systems or in larger quantities  or do so economically 
because of low sales volumes and other reasons  baxter s costs to manufacture commercial components for the platelet system have been greater than we previously anticipated and may continue to rise 
this may reduce our potential gross profit margin from platelet and plasma system sales 
we may be unable to contract with third parties to supply the intercept blood system in adequate quantities or to manufacture the system or its components at acceptable cost 
we are in the initial stages of commercializing the intercept blood system in europe and may not accurately forecast demand for the intercept blood system 
we may be unable to contract with third parties to supply adequate numbers of platelet and plasma systems and components to meet demand and  as a result  supply to our customers may be 
table of contents interrupted 
if baxter or third party manufacturers fail to produce our products or intersol products satisfactorily  at acceptable costs and in sufficient quantities  we may incur delays  shortfalls and additional expenses  which may in turn result in permanent harm to our customer relations 
in the united states  studies related to the platelet system disposable and compound manufacturing need to be completed and included in fda submissions before the fda would consider the applications for approval 
baxter and we purchase certain key components of the intercept blood system from a limited number of suppliers 
contracts for the long term supply of certain components have not yet been signed 
it would be expensive and time consuming to establish additional or replacement suppliers for these components 
some components of the intercept blood system  including components of the uva illuminator device  are no longer manufactured  which will require baxter or us to identify and qualify replacement components and may require that we conduct additional studies  which could include clinical trials  to demonstrate equivalency or validate any required design or component changes 
if baxter or we are unable to identify and supply replacement components  we may be unable to supply products to our customers 
if we were required to redesign the products  our development costs would increase  and our programs and commercialization efforts could be delayed significantly 
we intend to use third party manufacturers to produce commercial quantities of the chemical compounds to be used in our products 
these compounds have not yet been produced in quantities sufficient to support commercialization for all regions in which we may market our products 
we have an agreement with a manufacturer to produce commercial quantities of amotosalen  a proprietary compound used in our platelet and plasma systems 
we currently do not have any third party manufacturing agreements in place for commercial production of compounds used in our red blood cell system 
any new or additional commercial manufacturer will need to develop new methods and processes to manufacture these compounds on a commercial scale and demonstrate to us  the fda and foreign regulatory authorities that its commercial scale manufacturing processes comply with government regulations and that its compounds are equivalent to originally licensed compounds in order for us to maintain commercial licensure of our products 
it may be difficult or impossible to economically manufacture our products on a commercial scale 
we have relied on baxter for transition services 
we will need to perform these services ourselves or identify one or more alternative third party providers 
under the terms of our february agreement  baxter was required to provide certain transition services relating to european activities  at our expense 
these services included specified regulatory and clinical support activities  installation  maintenance and calibration services  and order entry  billing and collections from customers  device and systems development  monitoring and responding to customer complaints  and clinical education and training provided through december   and manufacturing technical information and advice  which baxter is obligated to provide through december  we have also been reliant on baxter to manage operational aspects of our presence in europe  including compliance with local  national and eu regulations relating to labor law  taxes  logistics  credit and collections and administration 
we need to continue to develop internal competencies in sales  marketing  distribution  regulatory support  operations and administration or arrange for third parties to provide certain of these necessary services 
we may be unable to assume these functions ourselves or identify alternative third party providers on a timely basis or on reasonable terms  if at all 
any delay in these activities could delay further regulatory approvals  market introduction and subsequent sales of the systems 
we have used prototype components in our preclinical studies and clinical trials of the intercept red blood cell system and have not completed the components commercial design 
the system disposables and instruments of our red blood cell system that we used in our preclinical studies and clinical trials in the united states historically and those we are now using in our new phase i red blood cell trial are prototypes of systems to be used in the final products 
as a result  we expect regulatory authorities will 
table of contents require us to perform additional preclinical and clinical studies using the commercial versions of the systems to demonstrate the acceptability of the commercial configuration and the equivalence of the prototypes and the commercial products design  which may increase our expenses and delay the commercialization of our products 
if we fail to develop commercial versions of the intercept red blood cell system on schedule  our potential revenue would be delayed or diminished and our competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do 
in addition  the design and engineering effort required to complete the final commercial product is substantial and time consuming 
as with any complex development effort  we expect to encounter design  engineering and manufacturing issues 
such issues have previously arisen  sometimes unexpectedly  and solutions to these issues have not always been readily forthcoming 
additional unforeseen design  engineering and manufacturing issues may arise in the future  which could increase the development cost and delay commercialization of our products 
we rely on bioone for commercialization of our platelet and plasma systems in many asian countries 
baxter and we have licensed to bioone  rights to commercialization of the platelet and plasma systems in japan  china  taiwan  south korea  vietnam  thailand  and singapore 
bioone is solely responsible for obtaining regulatory approvals  marketing and selling the platelet and plasma systems in those countries 
we understand that baxter does not intend to maintain its ce mark registration for the platelet system after it expires in mid in addition  we received ce mark approval for the plasma system independently from baxter  and baxter is not intending to apply for a ce mark for the plasma system 
however  bioone is dependent on baxter for the manufacture and supply of the platelet and plasma systems well beyond the time when baxter intends to let its ce mark registration for the platelet system lapse 
bioone is also dependent on baxter for providing certain regulatory support and the timely transition of regulatory files and dossiers 
bioone may be unable to qualify the platelet and plasma systems for sale in certain countries in its territory in the absence of ce marks being held by baxter  even if ce marks are held by us 
bioone has made only limited progress to date in commercializing the platelet and plasma systems in asian territories 
because we only have a minority investment interest in bioone  we lack the ability to significantly influence bioone  and are dependent on bioone s performance to realize milestone and royalty revenue from commercialization of our platelet and plasma systems in those countries 
in japan  regulatory authorities may require our platelet and plasma systems to be widely adopted commercially in europe or approved by the fda before the platelet and plasma systems are considered for approval in japan  which would delay or prevent bioone from achieving significant product sales 
we understand that bioone will need to raise additional capital in the first half of in order to fund its operations 
there is no assurance that bioone will be able to attract additional required capital to successfully commercialize those products licensed from baxter and us 
bioone may not be successful in commercializing the platelet and plasma systems in its asian territories  in which case the value of bioone s equity likely would decline and may give rise to an impairment in the carrying value of our equity interest in bioone 
our vaccine programs are in an early stage of development 
our vaccine programs are in an early stage of development and there is a high risk of failure 
we will be required to perform extensive preclinical and clinical testing before any product candidate can be submitted for regulatory approval prior to commercialization 
clinical testing is very expensive  takes many years  and the outcome is uncertain 
failure to demonstrate the safety or efficacy of a product candidate in preclinical studies or clinical trials would delay or prevent regulatory approval of that product candidate 
our potential vaccine products must meet rigorous testing standards in order to advance to clinical testing 
other than crs being tested in our current phase i clinical trial  no product candidates employing either our listeria or our kbma platform technologies have been tested in humans  and preclinical data in animal studies and from in vitro experiments may not be predictive of clinical safety and efficacy once product candidates are tested in humans 
our immunotherapy product candidates are unlikely to be used as single agents for the treatment of cancer or infectious diseases  but rather in combination with other drugs and treatment regimens 
testing our vaccines in 
table of contents combination with other drugs and treatment regimens in clinical trials will introduce additional clinical  timeline and regulatory risks and complexities  including added expense  delay in conducting clinical trials and uncertain regulatory requirements 
naturally occurring listeria is a bacterium that is a human pathogen that can cause serious illness 
our immunotherapy product candidates for cancer indications use proprietary  modified strains of listeria that are designed to have a substantially reduced ability to cause illness in humans 
however  before our vaccine candidates can be accepted for clinical testing  we must successfully complete a number of preclinical safety studies 
we may not be able to identify a dose range in which our product candidates are therapeutically effective and yet maintain adequate safety margins 
investigators have encountered and may continue to encounter difficulties in enrolling suitable patients in our trials  which have contributed to delays and increased costs in completing the crs phase i trial 
clearance of a phase i clinical trial using crs does not imply concurrence by fda to our conducting later stage studies with crs and does not imply clearance for clinical trials of our other listeria vaccine candidates expressing antigens  such as crs because crs and our other preclinical product candidates using listeria rely on the same base strain of listeria used in crs  any adverse findings in clinical trials of crs would likely adversely affect our ability to develop and test these other product candidates in human clinical trials 
our phase i clinical trial for crs involves testing in a patient population with advanced disease 
we may be unable to test crs and our other product candidates in subsequent trials in patient populations that we believe may be better suited clinically or commercially to our vaccines 
because our vaccine candidates use novel platforms  the fda or foreign regulators may require studies that we have not anticipated 
in addition  we have contracted with third party manufacturers to produce our vaccines for research  preclinical and clinical testing 
we have manufactured crs for toxicology studies and phase i clinical trials  but have not engaged in scale up of the manufacturing process or the development of a commercial formulation 
we also rely on third parties to conduct aspects of preclinical and clinical development on our behalf  including contract manufacturing and research services 
these third parties may encounter delays  over which we have significantly less control than research and development activities performed in house  or experience unexpected results 
we may experience numerous unforeseen events during  or as a result of  the preclinical research and development process that could delay or prevent clinical testing  regulatory approval and commercialization of our potential products 
our ability to successfully develop cancer and infectious disease products is dependent in part on being able to attract and retain partners and collaborators  as well as governmental funding sources 
the development and commercialization of product candidates employing our listeria and kbma platform technologies will be expensive  lengthy and uncertain 
to date  we have relied not only upon internal scientific  development and financial resources  but also upon third parties 
we have licensed our listeria platform to medimmune for use in developing a product candidate potentially applicable to cancers expressing epha  a proprietary antigen owned by medimmune 
we are collaborating with investigators at johns hopkins university on other cancer and infectious disease programs 
we also rely on advice and insights from our scientific advisory board  a group of independent clinicians  professors and investigators  regarding our research and development activities 
these relationships provide us with external perspectives and independent validation that may be critical to our future success 
loss of these relationships or failure to attract others may result in additional expense  delays in development and regulatory approval and failure to commercialize products 
we have received significant funding from united states government agencies for research and development in both cancer and infectious disease  as well as funding from medimmune under our license agreement relating to development of medi epha  however  development funding from medimmune to cerus ceased at the completion of contracted work we had performed through early and medimmune is pursuing advanced preclinical work on medi on its own 
due to budgetary constraints  funding from the federal government  particularly funding from the department of defense and national institutes of health  is expected to be reduced from prior years and is subject to political and economic forces beyond our control 
additionally  we no longer 
table of contents are deemed to be a small business for purposes of being eligible for certain grants administered by the national institutes of health and regulated by small business administration 
academic and third party funding we have been awarded to date for early stage preclinical development of our therapeutic vaccine candidates for hepatitis c and hiv may be inadequate to allow us to demonstrate proof of concept of our kbma listeria approach as potential standalone or combination therapies for these indications 
federal funding in support of our programs to develop prophylactic vaccines against anthrax and tularemia is not expected to lead to substantial commercial opportunities beyond potential biodefense applications  and we cannot be certain that the research conducted into those two infectious diseases will readily translate into applications with greater commercial potential 
we may be unable to attract additional external funding to allow us to continue development of these product candidates 
loss of funding from government sources and third parties would require us to reduce the scope of our research and development efforts in immunotherapeutics  narrowing the number of programs to those we could support through internal resources 
if our competitors develop and market products that are more effective than our product candidates  our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated 
conversely  if competitors encounter difficulties or failures in human clinical trials  we may face additional clinical and regulatory challenges 
we expect our products to encounter significant competition 
the intercept blood system products may compete with other approaches to blood safety currently in use  as well as with future products that may be developed by others 
our success will depend in part on our ability to respond quickly to medical and technological changes brought about by the development and introduction of new products 
product development is risky and uncertain  and we cannot assure you that we will develop our products successfully 
competitors products or technologies may make our products obsolete or non competitive before we are able to generate any significant revenue 
in addition  competitors or potential competitors may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have 
they may also have greater experience in preclinical testing  human clinical trials and other regulatory approval procedures 
several companies are developing technologies that are  or in the future may be  the basis for products that will directly compete with or reduce the market for our pathogen inactivation systems 
a number of companies are specifically focusing on alternative strategies for pathogen inactivation in platelets and plasma 
in europe  several companies  including grifols  octapharma ag and maco pharma international gmbh  are developing or have developed and are selling commercial pathogen inactivation systems to treat fresh frozen plasma 
navigant biotechnologies  a wholly owned subsidiary of gambro group  is developing a pathogen inactivation system for blood products 
new methods of testing blood for specific pathogens have been approved by the fda and in europe  as have tests for bacteria in platelets 
continued delays in commercialization of the platelet system in france and germany may impact our ability to compete with bacterial testing for platelets 
tests have recently been approved to detect west nile virus in blood products 
other groups are developing rapid  point of care bacterial tests  synthetic blood product substitutes and products to stimulate the growth of platelets 
development and commercialization of any of these or other related technologies could impair the potential market for our products 
there are many companies pursuing programs for the treatment of cancer and treatment and prevention of infectious disease 
some are large pharmaceutical companies  such as pfizer  glaxosmithkline  sanofi aventis  bristol myers squibb  genentech and gilead  which have greater experience and resources in product development  preclinical testing  human clinical trials  obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals and in manufacturing and marketing new therapies 
we are also competing with other biotechnology companies  such as cell genesys  inc  coley pharmaceutical group  and dendreon corporation  that have cancer vaccine programs that are in more advanced stages of development than ours 
in addition  other companies are pursuing early stage research and development of listeria based immunotherapies 
if any of these companies products 
table of contents are shown to be more efficacious than ours  our listeria based products may fail to gain regulatory approval or commercial acceptance 
if these companies products fail in human clinical trials  we may be required to overcome more significant regulatory barriers prior to gaining approval  face more challenging impediments to market acceptance and may be unable to raise capital to fund development of our listeria or kbma programs 
we may be liable and we may need to withdraw our products from the market if our products harm people 
we may be liable if an accident occurs in our controlled use of hazardous materials 
we are exposed to potential liability risks inherent in the testing and marketing of medical devices and pharmaceutical products 
we may be liable if any of our products cause injury  illness or death 
although we will have completed rigorous preclinical and clinical safety testing prior to marketing our products  there may be harmful effects caused by our products that we are unable to identify in preclinical or clinical testing 
in particular  unforeseen  rare reactions or adverse side effects related to long term use of our products may not be observed until the products are in widespread commercial use 
because of the limited duration and number of patients receiving blood components treated with the intercept blood system products in clinical trials  it is possible that harmful effects of our products not observed in clinical and preclinical testing could be discovered in clinical trials or after a marketing approval has been received 
later discovery of problems with a product  manufacturer or facility may result in additional restrictions on the product or manufacturer  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
we are subject to risks and costs of product recall  which include not only potential out of pocket costs  but also potential interruption to our supply chain 
in such an event  our customer relations would be harmed and we would incur unforeseen losses 
we maintain product liability insurance  but do not know whether the insurance will provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities 
if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims  we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our products 
our research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  including certain hazardous chemicals  radioactive materials and infectious pathogens  such as hiv and hepatitis viruses 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of hazardous materials are adequate and comply with regulatory requirements  we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury 
if an accident occurs  we could be held liable for any damages that result 
virtually all of our research and development activities and the significant majority of our general and administrative activities are performed in or managed from at a single site that may be subject to lengthy business interruption in the event of a severe earthquake 
virtually all of our research and development activities and the significant majority of our general and administrative activities are performed in or managed from our facilities in concord  california  which are within an active earthquake fault zone 
should a severe earthquake occur  we might be unable to occupy our facilities or conduct research and development and general and administrative activities in support of our business and products until such time as our facilities could be repaired and made operational 
our property and casualty and business interruption insurance in general does not cover losses caused by earthquakes 
while we have taken certain measures to protect our scientific  technological and commercial assets  a lengthy or costly disruption due to an earthquake would have a material adverse effect on us 
we have only a limited operating history  and we expect to continue to generate losses 
we may never achieve a profitable level of operations 
to date  we have engaged primarily in research and development 
our development and selling  general  and administrative expenses have resulted in substantial losses each year since our inception with the exception of the year ended december  in  we realized a million nonrecurring gain associated with the restructuring of a loan payable in and  as a result of this gain  we recorded net income of million in at december   we had an 
table of contents accumulated deficit of approximately million 
except for the platelet and plasma systems  which have received european union ce mark approval  all of our products are in the research and development stage  and we have not received significant revenue from product sales 
we have received substantially all of our revenue from our agreements with our development partners and from federal research grants and cooperative agreements 
we will be required to conduct significant research  development  clinical testing and regulatory compliance activities for each of these products 
we expect our losses to continue at least until more of our product candidates are commercialized and achieve significant market acceptance 
if we fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our future operations  we will not be able to develop product candidates in our pipeline 
our product development programs are capital intensive 
we may need to reduce or stop further investment in specific research and development or sales and marketing activities if we are unable to obtain additional capital or if any of our development programs are determined by us to be economically unfeasible 
a product or program may be determined to be uneconomic if the commercial opportunity is insufficient to justify the investment required to develop and market the product or for other reasons 
we expect that our spending in support of research  development and commercialization of the platelet and plasma systems will be in excess of contribution from product sales  milestone payments and development funding for such programs from third parties over the next year 
we re entered clinical trials for the red blood cell system in mid with only partial funding from governmental sources 
in addition  as a consequence of the february restructuring agreement with baxter  we have taken on increasing operational and financial responsibility for the commercialization of the platelet and plasma systems  particularly in europe 
as a result of these factors  further product development and commercialization of the intercept blood system may take longer and be more expensive than we previously anticipated 
we expect to continue to spend substantial funds for our operations for the foreseeable future 
our cash  liquidity and capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the development progress and costs of our programs  payments from collaborators  funding from agencies of the united states government  costs related to creating  maintaining and defending our intellectual property position  regulatory approval and successful commercialization of our product candidates  competitive developments and regulatory factors 
through december   we had been awarded million in funding under cooperative agreements with the department of defense  and have received million in proceeds from these awards 
we also have received funding under grants from the national institutes of health 
further funding awarded under federal grants and cooperative agreements is subject to the authorization of funds and approval of our research plans by various organizations within the federal government  including the us congress 
the general economic environment  coupled with tight federal budgets  has led to a general decline in the amount of government funding 
additionally  we no longer are deemed to be a small business for purposes of being eligible for certain grants administered by the national institutes of health and regulated by small business administration 
if we are unable to obtain federal grant and cooperative agreement funding for future activities at levels similar to past funding  we may need to reduce our operating expenses  which would delay progress in some of our development programs 
in addition  we are required separately to administer and account for our work under government contracts and grants on an on going basis as a condition to accepting government funding which places administrative  accounting and reporting burdens on us beyond those we have assumed as a public company 
if we fail to comply with applicable governmental administrative  accounting and reporting regulations with respect to these grants and cooperative agreements  funds currently available to us may be reduced or lost 
these conditions may also result in increased selling  general  and administrative spending beyond what we have experienced 

table of contents we may not be able to protect our intellectual property or operate our business without infringing intellectual property rights of others 
our commercial success will depend  in part  on obtaining and maintaining patent protection on our products and successfully defending our products against third party challenges 
our technology will be protected from unauthorized use only to the extent that it is covered by valid and enforceable patents or effectively maintained as trade secrets 
as a result  our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents  protect trade secrets  operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others  and prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights 
we cannot be certain that our patents or patents that we license from others will be enforceable and afford protection against competitors 
our patents or patent applications  if issued  may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
our patent rights may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technologies 
others may independently develop technologies similar to ours or independently duplicate our technologies 
for example  a united states patent issued to a third party covers methods to remove psoralen compounds from blood products 
we have reviewed the patent and believe our work predates the invention disclosed in that patent 
we are continuing to review that patent and will make a determination as to whether any action is necessary 
in addition  others hold patents  and have pending patent applications  concerning listeria based immunotherapies 
those patents and new patents that may be issued upon the pending applications  if valid  would restrict us from bringing to market particular embodiments of listeria based immunotherapy products 
while we believe that such restrictions do not preclude us from developing and commercializing our listeria based immunotherapy products  they may preclude us from pursuing certain product approaches that might otherwise be promising 
our patents expire at various dates between and recent patent applications  principally related to our immunotherapy programs  will  if granted  result in patents with later expiration dates 
due to the extensive time required for development  testing and regulatory review of our potential products  our patents may expire or remain in existence for only a short period following commercialization 
this would reduce or eliminate any advantage of the patents 
we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our issued patents or pending patent applications or that we were the first to file patent applications for such inventions 
we may need to license the right to use third party patents and intellectual property to continue development and commercialization of our products 
we may not be able to acquire such required licenses on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we do not obtain such licenses  we may need to design around other parties patents  or we may not be able to proceed with the development  manufacture or sale of our products 
we may face litigation to defend against claims of infringement  assert claims of infringement  enforce our patents  protect our trade secrets or know how or determine the scope and validity of others proprietary rights 
patent litigation is costly 
in addition  we may require interference proceedings before the united states patent and trademark office to determine the priority of inventions relating to our patent applications 
litigation or interference proceedings could be expensive and time consuming  and we could be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights 
we may rely  in certain circumstances  on trade secrets to protect our technology 
however  trade secrets are difficult to protect 
we protect our proprietary technology and processes  in part  by confidentiality agreements with employees and certain contractors 
these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach or our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors 
to the extent that our employees  consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others  disputes also may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know how and inventions 

table of contents as our international operations grow  we may be subject to adverse fluctuations in exchange rates between the united states dollar and foreign currencies 
consequently  we may suffer losses 
our international operations are subject to risks typical of an international business  including  among other factors differing political  economic  and regulatory climates  different tax structures  and foreign exchange volatility 
we do not currently enter into any hedging contracts to normalize the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations 
as a result  our future results could be materially affected by changes in these or other factors 
product sales of our blood safety products are typically made in europe and generally are invoiced to customers in euros 
in addition  we incur operating expenses in foreign currencies 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate volatility is a direct result of our product sales  cash collection and expenses to support of our international operations 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations are recorded as a component of interest expense and other  net on our consolidated statements of operations 
significant fluctuations in the volatility of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar may materially affect our results of operations 
currently we do not have any near term plans to enter into a formal hedging program to mitigate the effects of foreign currency volatility 
the market price of our stock may be highly volatile 
the market prices for our securities and those of other emerging medical device and biotechnology companies have been  and may continue to be  volatile 
for example  during the period from january  to december   the sale price of our common stock as quoted on the nasdaq global market fluctuated within a range from a low of to a high of 
announcements may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
such announcements may include biological or medical discoveries  technological innovations or new commercial services by us or our competitors  developments concerning proprietary rights  including patents and litigation matters  regulatory developments in both the united states and foreign countries  status of development partnerships  dilution from future issuances of common stock  public concern as to the safety of new technologies  general market conditions  comments made by analysts  including changes in analysts estimates of our financial performance  and quarterly fluctuations in our revenue and financial results 
the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices for emerging biotechnology and medical device companies  and which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
if there is an adverse outcome in the securities class action litigation that has been filed against us  our business may be harmed 
we and certain of our current and former officers and directors are named as defendants in a purported securities class action lawsuit filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california 
the lawsuit is brought on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of our securities  and seeks unspecified damages 
in addition  our directors and certain of our current and former officers have been named as defendants in a derivative lawsuit in the superior court for the county of contra costa  california  which names cerus as a nominal defendant 
the plaintiff in this action is a cerus stockholder who seeks to bring derivative claims on 
table of contents behalf of cerus against the defendants 
the lawsuit alleges breaches of fiduciary duty and related claims 
on august   we announced that we had reached agreements to settle the outstanding class action and derivative lawsuits 
pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreements  the plaintiffs agreed to provide the defendants with a release of all claims related to such class action and derivative lawsuits without any admission of wrongdoing or liability by any party 
under these settlement agreements  the total cash settlements will be funded entirely by insurance carriers under our directors and officers liability insurance policy and will have no financial impact on cerus 
on february   the federal district court granted final approval to the class action settlement 
on february   the state court granted final approval to the derivative settlement 
both settlements will become effective upon the expiration of the time in which to appeal the judgments of dismissal that the federal and state courts have entered or soon will enter 
under terms of the settlements  the company believes that these matters will not have a material effect on its results of operations or financial position  however  it cannot predict when  if ever  the settlements will become effective 
if the settlements do not become effective  we may have to incur substantial expenses in connection with these lawsuits and in the event of an adverse outcome  our business could be harmed 
we may fail to comply fully with elements of the sarbanes oxley act of our failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section of this act could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accountants attesting to and reporting on these assessments 
these requirements extend to the operations of our subsidiary in europe 
if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting  as such standards are modified  supplemented or amended from time to time  we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude in future periods that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of if we cannot favorably assess  or our independent registered public accountants are unable to provide an unqualified attestation report on our assessment of  the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting  investor confidence in the reliability of our financial reports may be adversely affected  which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
results for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of future results 
overview since our inception in  we have devoted substantially all of our efforts and resources to the research  development  clinical testing and commercialization of blood safety systems and  more recently  immunotherapies for cancer and infectious disease 
with the exception of a non recurring gain recognized during the three months ended march   we have been generally unprofitable since inception and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
except for the platelet and plasma systems  for which the european union approved issuance of ce marks  all of our product candidates are in the research and development stage 
we initiated a phase i clinical trial for crs  a product candidate employing our attenuated listeria technology platform  in after the fda approved our earlier ind filing  and we re entered phase i human clinical trials in the united states for the red blood cell system in the late summer of to date  our primary source of revenue has been from milestone and development contracts and collaborative agreements and grants from us government agencies  including the us armed forces and the national institutes of health  or nih 
we have recognized modest european product revenues from the sale of our platelet system and had just launched the commercialization of our plasma system on a limited basis by the end of we anticipate continued growth of our product sales as we penetrate european markets and more fully launch our plasma system 
we must conduct significant research  development  preclinical and clinical evaluation  commercialization and regulatory compliance activities on our product candidates that  together with anticipated general and administrative expenses  are expected to result in substantial losses at least until after commercialization of additional products 
our ability to achieve a profitable level of operations in the future will depend on our ability to successfully commercialize and achieve market acceptance of our blood safety and immunotherapy product candidates 
we may never achieve a profitable level of operations 
through december   in addition to the product revenues from sales of our platelet systems  we have recognized revenue from an ongoing development agreement with medimmune and commercialization agreements with bioone  as well as from grants and cooperative agreements from the armed forces and the nih 
under the agreements with medimmune and bioone  we have received milestone payments and development funding and may receive additional contingent milestone payments and royalties on future product sales 
as of december   we had cumulatively received million of upfront and milestone payments from medimmune under the terms of our agreement with them  consisting of a million up front payment and a million milestone payment  and had received a total of million in cash payments and equity securities from bioone 
under the medimmune agreement  we had also received development funding 

table of contents we also entered into cooperative agreements with the armed forces and received grants and contracts from the nih to conduct certain research and development activities 
these cooperative agreements and grants are related to both our blood safety and immunotherapy and infectious disease platforms 
the following table summarizes the revenues recognized from government grants and cooperative agreements and the programs which the revenues related for the years ended december   and years ended december  in thousands  except percentage blood safety immunotherapy total revenue in late  we mutually agreed to discontinue development efforts whereby  along with the pharmaceutical division of kirin brewery co 
ltd  or kirin  we were developing and marketing products for stem cell transplantation 
effective february   we entered into a new agreement with baxter related to the intercept blood system 
under terms of the february agreement  we gained worldwide rights to the intercept platelet and plasma systems previously held by baxter  excluding certain asian countries covered in agreements with bioone 
we previously acquired worldwide commercialization rights for the red blood cell system from baxter 
beginning in  we will pay baxter royalties on product sales  at a rate of of net sales for the platelet system  for the plasma system and for the red blood cell system 
this royalty structure replaces the terms of previous agreements with baxter under which we had received a defined share of the gross profits from product sales 
under the terms of the february agreement  baxter agreed to supply certain transition services to us through at our expense  including regulatory  technical and back office support  and to conduct certain continued development efforts relating to the plasma system at its expense 
baxter also agreed to manufacture systems for the platelet and plasma systems on a cost plus basis through december   and components through december   and agreed to supply only very limited types of components for the prototype of the red blood cell system 
on october   baxter announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to sell its transfusion therapies business  the unit of baxter that has performed many of the manufacturing and supply chain activities related to our relationship with baxter  to a new company formed by an investment group led by texas pacific group 
subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions  baxter has informed us that it expects the transaction to close within the first quarter of our agreement with baxter will remain in effect  although baxter has informed us that it expects the new company to assume baxter s manufacturing obligations to us 
as a result of the february agreement with baxter  we recorded net gains and deferred gains in excess of million and also repaid the million promissory note plus accrued interest owed to baxter capital that had originally been due in december at december   we had million in remaining deferred gains  all of which are associated with payments made to vendors by december   in support of intercept commercialization efforts 
we anticipate recognizing the remainder of the deferred gain balance in as the vendors complete the services 
under the terms of the february agreement  we are responsible for the commercialization and development of the platelet and plasma systems  except in parts of asia 
we expect that our spending over the next year in support of research  development and commercialization of the platelet and plasma systems will be in excess of the contribution from product sales to customers and from milestone payments and development funding for such programs from baxter  bioone  the armed forces and others 
we also anticipate increasing our expenditures in support of clinical trials and device development of our red blood cell system  as well as the preclinical and early stage clinical development of our immunotherapy programs in both cancer and infectious disease 

table of contents critical accounting policies and management estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to collaborative arrangements  contract research and other contingencies  and non cash stock compensation assumptions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  require us to make significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue and research and development expenses revenue is recognized when i a written agreement with the funding party exists  ii services have been delivered  iii pricing is fixed or determinable  and iv collection is probable 
revenue related to the cost reimbursement provisions under development contracts is recognized as the costs on the projects are incurred 
revenue related to substantive at risk milestones specified under development contracts is recognized as the milestones are achieved 
to date  we have not received license fees or milestone payments that are refundable 
to the extent that they are subject to future performance criteria  we recognize revenue ratably over the estimated license or development period 
we have received up front payments from collaboration agreements 
these up front payments are deferred and recognized over the period we estimate we are likely to have involvement 
we have also received equity in a privately held company in addition to cash as consideration in milestone payments 
we evaluate several criteria to determine the fair value of the equity received and to conclude whether the facts and circumstances support a fair value for revenue recognition and the investment balance 
these criteria include  but are not limited to  third party investor interest and participation in recent equity offerings at current pricing  business outlook of the privately held company  and available financial information of the privately held company 
the financial information we receive is generally only available on an infrequent basis 
although management uses the best available information at the time  there can be no absolute assurance that facts and circumstances will not change in the future 
should these facts and circumstances change  they may negatively impact our consolidated financial statements 
we receive certain united states government grants and contracts that support our research effort in defined research projects 
these grants generally provide for reimbursement of approved costs incurred as defined in the various grants 
revenue associated with these grants is recognized as costs under each grant are incurred 
accrued expenses we record accrued liabilities for certain contract research activities and development services  including those related to clinical trials  preclinical safety studies and external laboratory studies  as well as transition services and development activities being performed by third parties 
some of those accrued liabilities are based on estimates because billings for these activities may not occur on a timely basis consistent with the performance of the services 
specifically  accruals for clinical trials require us to make estimates surrounding costs associated with patients at various stages of the clinical trial  pass through costs to clinical sites  contract research organization costs including fees  database development  and reporting costs  among others 
stock based compensation we issue stock based awards to our employees  board of directors  scientific advisory boards and certain contractors as strategic  long term incentives 
beginning in the first quarter of  we recorded stock based compensation expense for these awards under statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  or fas r 
we have elected to use the modified prospective method of adoption 
we record compensation expense to our income statement based on the grant date fair value of a stock award and expense the fair value on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
we determine the grant date fair value of a stock award using the black scholes option pricing model 

table of contents the black scholes option pricing model calculates the grant date fair value using certain variables 
these variables are impacted by our stock price  award exercise behaviors  the risk free interest rate and our expected dividends and many of these variables require us to use significant judgment 
expected term 
we estimate the expected term of options granted using a variety of factors 
where possible  we estimate the expected term of options granted by analyzing employee exercise and post vesting termination behavior 
to make this estimation  we analyze the population of options granted by discreet homogeneous groups 
for those homogeneous groups where we are unable to obtain sufficient information to estimate the expected term in this manner  we estimate the expected term of the options granted by taking the average of the vesting term and the contractual term of the option  as illustrated in the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab the expected term of employee stock purchase plan shares is the average of the remaining purchase periods under each offering period 
estimated forfeiture rate 
we estimate the forfeiture rate of options at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
we estimate the historic pre vesting forfeiture rates by groups that possess a degree of homogeneity regarding average time to vest and expected term 
estimated volatility 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock by using both historical volatility of our common stock and implied volatility in market traded options in accordance with sab our decision to use both historical volatility and implied volatility was based upon the limited availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that due to the limited availability of actively traded options  historical volatility should be given greater prominence in our decision as we believe it is more representative of future stock price 
as such  we have calculated our estimated volatility by weighting both historical volatility and implied volatility 
we have used significant judgment in making these estimates and we will continue to monitor the availability of actively traded options on our common stock 
risk free interest rate 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the option valuation model on us treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options 
expected dividend 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option valuation model 
if factors change and we utilize different assumptions in determining the grant date fair value of stock compensation expense in the future  or if we utilize a different option pricing model in the future  then those results may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially effect our operating results 
there is significant risk that the black scholes option pricing model and the judgment we have used in ascertaining the variables will yield results that differ materially from the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  termination or forfeitures of the awards in the future 
historical results were utilized in deriving our variables  which may not be indicative of the future 
income taxes since our inception we have accumulated significant net operating losses and research and development credits that may by used in future periods to offset future taxable income 
we currently estimate that we may not be able to utilize all of our deferred tax assets 
in addition  we may not generate future taxable income prior to the expiration of our net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credits 
timing and significance of any estimated future taxable income is highly subjective and is beyond the control of management due to uncertainties in market conditions  economic environments in which we operate  and timing of regulatory approval of our products 

table of contents results of operations years ended december   and revenue years ended december  in thousands  except percentage change milestone and development funding government grant and cooperative agreements product revenue total revenue revenue increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in milestone and development funding from bioone  baxter and medimmune increased to million during the year ended december   from million during the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to the receipt and recognition of million in milestone funding received from bioone as a result of our receipt of the ce mark approval for the plasma system 
the million of milestone funding received from bioone consisted of million in cash consideration and bioone equity securities valued at million 
milestone and development funding from bioone  baxter  and medimmune was  and  respectively  of total revenue for the year ended december   as compared to  and for the corresponding period in we do not anticipate recognizing significant future revenue from baxter under our existing agreements 
revenue from government grants and cooperative agreements decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in the decrease was due primarily to the reduced awards from the armed forces for research activities for our immunotherapy program 
we recognized million in revenue for research and development activities under an agreement with the armed forces for the year ended december   as compared to million for the corresponding period in we no longer are deemed to be a small business for purposes of being eligible for certain grants administered by the nih and regulated by small business administration 
as a result  we will not be eligible to apply for any new grants that meet the criteria for those certain types of grants 
for the year ended december   we recognized million of product revenue from sales of the intercept blood system for platelets in europe  compared to million during the same period in the prior year 
prior to the february agreements with baxter  product revenue represented our share of adjusted gross margins on platelet system sales 
subsequent to february   product revenue represents the sales from platelet systems 
the results may not be indicative of platelet system revenue in the future 
we anticipate product revenues for both the platelet and plasma systems to increase in future periods as the intercept blood system gains market acceptance in europe and other geographies where commercialization efforts are underway 
for the year ended december   we recognized million of product sales revenue from our share of gross margins from sales of the intercept blood system for platelets in europe  pursuant to the terms of the agreement with baxter then in place 
cost of product revenue 
years ended december  in thousands  except percentage change cost of product revenue 
table of contents prior to the february agreement with baxter  we did not record cost of product revenue or gross margins from product sales 
subsequent to february   the effective date of the agreement  and through december   our cost of product revenue consisted primarily of platelet system inventory sold 
inventory is accounted for on a first in  first out basis 
these results may not be indicative of future costs of product sales or gross margins 
we anticipate our cost of product revenue to increase in the future as a result of increased product sale volume  royalties that will be owed to baxter on platelet and plasma system sales  and as we perform or find alternative service providers for supply chain and back office order fulfillment services 
research and development 
our research and development expenses include salaries and related expenses for our scientific personnel  payments to consultants  costs to prepare and conduct preclinical and clinical trials  third party costs for development activities  certain regulatory costs  costs for licensed technologies  and costs associated with our infrastructure  and laboratory chemicals and supplies 
beginning january   our research and development expenses also include non cash stock based compensation as a result of adopting fas r 
years ended december  in thousands  except percentage change research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december   increased million to million from million for the corresponding period in of the million in research and development expenses recognized during the year ended december   million was due to non cash stock based compensation recognized in accordance with the adoption of fas r 
additional factors for the increase in research and development expenses during compared to include costs incurred to initiate and maintain phase i clinical trials for the red blood cell system and crs product candidates  costs associated with the development of the plasma system  and an increase in the number of research and development personnel employed 
our total research and development costs included million for our blood safety programs and million for our immunotherapy programs for the twelve months ended december   and million for our blood safety programs and million for our immunotherapy programs for the comparable period in we anticipate that our research and development spending will continue and at times  may increase in the future as a result of ongoing and later stage preclincal and clinical trials  and as potential products move from discovery to preclinical and clinical trials 
due to the inherent uncertainties and risks associated with developing biomedical and biopharmaceutical products  including but not limited to intense and changing government regulation  uncertainty of future preclinical and clinical study results and uncertainty associated with manufacturing it is not possible to reasonably estimate the costs to complete our research and development projects 
selling  general  and administrative 
selling  general  and administrative expenses include salaries and related expenses for administrative personnel  expenses for our commercialization efforts underway in europe  expenses for accounting  tax  and internal control  legal and facility related expenses  and insurance premiums 
beginning january   our selling  general  and administrative expenses also include non cash stock based compensation as a result of adopting fas r

table of contents selling  general  and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in of the million of selling  general  and administrative expense recognized during the year ended december   million was due to non cash stock based compensation recognized under fas r 
additional factors for the increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses during compared to include costs associated with establishing and building our commercial operations in europe  as well as increased legal and accounting fees 
we anticipate our selling  general  and administrative expenses will continue to increase as we ramp up our intercept commercialization efforts and continue to work toward broader market acceptance in europe 
gain on loan settlement 
years ended december  in thousands  except percentage change gain on loan settlement under an agreement entered into with baxter capital in  we repaid million and concurrently entered into a promissory note for million payable with interest as full satisfaction of a loan obligation during the year ending december  as a result of the agreement  during the twelve months ended december   we recorded a non operating gain of million

table of contents for the year ended december   milestone and development funding  which includes amounts received from baxter  bioone  medimmune and kirin  increased to million from million for the increase in these revenues during compared to is primarily due to revenue recognized from up front payments received from bioone and medimmune originally received and deferred in and recognized ratably over respective development terms 
additionally  the increase in milestone and development funding recognized in compared to is attributable to increased development funding and a milestone payment received from medimmune under the april agreement 
milestone and development funding from baxter  bioone  medimmune and kirin was   and  of milestone and development funding respectively for the year ended december  revenue from government grants and cooperative agreements increased to million in the year ended december   from million for  due primarily to increased government funding for both blood safety and vaccines programs 
for the year ended december   we recognized million of product sales representing our share of margins of the platelet system in europe 
as a result of a loan dispute with baxter capital that was subsequently resolved  we also recognized approximately million in product sales revenue from that was deferred until february we did not record any product revenue in research and development 
during the years ended and  research and development expenses include salaries and related expenses for scientific personnel  payments to consultants  payments for licensed technologies  supplies and chemicals used in in house laboratories  costs of research and development facilities  depreciation of equipment and external contract research expenses  including clinical trials  preclinical safety studies  manufacturing development and other laboratory studies

years ended december  in thousands  except percentage change selling  general  and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for  due principally to reduced headcount costs in which are directly attributable to the restructuring of our operations 

table of contents restructuring 
years ended december  in thousands  except percentage change restructuring on june   we announced that we realigned our operations to better match our cost structure to our operations 
as a result of the realignment  we reduced our workforce by approximately and reduced our operating expenses 
we recorded aggregate charges of million during the second and third quarters of related to this restructuring 
restructuring costs primarily include severance benefits to employees terminated as part of the restructuring 
we do not expect to record further costs related to the restructuring 
gain on loan settlement 
years ended december  in thousands  except percentage change gain on loan settlement concurrent with the restructured agreements between baxter and us  baxter capital and we entered into an agreement under which we immediately paid million to baxter capital and entered into a promissory note for million  payable with interest in december baxter capital agreed to accept these payments in full satisfaction of the loan obligation  and the parties dismissed all related legal actions 
as a result  we recorded a non operating gain of million that reflected the difference between loan principal and accrued interest balances recorded through  less amounts paid in february and remaining accrued liabilities as a result of the settlement  and long term debt of million  representing the note due to baxter capital in december  which accrues interest at 
the gain on the loan settlement was recognized in the period ending march   when the settlement occurred

in  interest was accrued at on the million loan from baxter capital 
liquidity and capital resources our sources of capital to date have primarily consisted of public offerings and private placements of equity securities  payments received under our agreements with baxter  bioone  medimmune and others  united states government grants and cooperative agreements  and interest income 
to date  we have not derived a significant amount of capital from product sales  and we will not derive significant capital from product sales unless and until more of our products receive regulatory approval and achieve market acceptance 

table of contents at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in the decrease in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to increases in our revenues and related cash collections in compared to  as well as changes in our operating assets and liabilities  notably decreases in our accounts payable balances 
net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december   was million  primarily due to purchases of short term investments  partially offset by the maturity of short term investments 
net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december   was million  compared to cash used in financing activities of million for the same period in the increase in compared to was largely due to the issuance of  shares of common stock in a public offering in march  providing net proceeds of million  and the issuance of  shares of common stock in a registered direct offering in december  providing net proceeds of approximately million  offset by the repayment of a loan from baxter capital of million plus accrued interest 
during the same period in  we repaid million on the note due to baxter 
working capital increased to million at december   from million at december   primarily due to the receipt of proceeds from our stock offerings and  to a lesser degree  from the gain from the february commercialization transition agreement with baxter recognized during the period 
we believe that our available cash balances  together with anticipated cash flows from product sales and existing development and grant arrangements  will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements through these near term capital requirements are dependent on various factors  including the progress and costs of development and commercialization of the intercept blood system and research and development of our immunotherapy programs  payments from our development and commercialization partners  including bioone  cash collected from product sales  and from the united states government  and costs related to creating  maintaining and defending our intellectual property 
our long term capital requirements will be dependent on these factors and on our ability to raise capital through public or private equity or debt financings or through additional collaborative arrangements or government grants  development progress in our immunotherapy programs  regulatory approval and successful commercialization of the intercept blood system and other product candidates  competitive developments and regulatory factors 
future capital funding transactions may result in dilution to our investors  and may not be available on favorable terms or at all
