as of december   the company had allowances for doubtful accounts of million on  million of accounts receivable 

table of contents inventory reserves the company reduces its inventory value for estimated obsolete and slow moving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets the company conducts its annual test of impairment for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in the third quarter because it coincides with its annual strategic planning process for all of its businesses 
the company also tests for impairment if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or the indefinite life intangible asset is below its carrying amount 
the company tests for impairment at the operating segment level 
the company cannot predict the occurrence of certain events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets 
such events may include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on the company s customer base  or a material negative change in its relationships with significant customers 
additionally  increases in the risk adjusted rate could result in impairment charges 
the company assesses the fair value of its reporting units for its goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets primarily trademarks and tradenames in its impairment tests  generally based upon a discounted cash flow methodology  or an actual sales offer received from a prospective buyer  if available 
the discounted cash flows are estimated utilizing various assumptions regarding future revenue and expenses  working capital  terminal value  and market discount rates 
the underlying assumptions used are consistent with those used in the strategic plan 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit is greater than the fair value  goodwill impairment may be present 
the company measures the goodwill impairment based upon the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  including any unrecognized intangible assets  and estimates the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment charge is recognized to the extent the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment charge is recorded to the extent the recorded intangible asset exceeds the fair value 
other long lived assets the company continuously evaluates if impairment indicators related to its property  plant and equipment and other long lived assets are present 
these impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset or asset group  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition  or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset or asset group 
if impairment indicators are present  the company estimates the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets 
the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount 
the cash flows are estimated utilizing various assumptions regarding future revenue and expenses  working capital  and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with the strategic plan 
if the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows  the company discounts the future cash flows using a discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group 
generally  the company performs its testing of the asset group at the product line level  as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available 
product liability reserves the company has a self insurance program for product liability that includes reserves for self retained losses and certain excess and aggregate risk transfer insurance 
the company uses historical loss experience combined with 
table of contents actuarial evaluation methods  review of significant individual files and the application of risk transfer programs in determining required product liability reserves 
the company s actuarial evaluation methods take into account claims incurred but not reported when determining the company s product liability reserve 
the company has product liability reserves of million as of december  while the company believes that it has adequately reserved for these claims  the ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the amounts recorded by the company and such additional losses may be material to the company s consolidated financial statements 
legal and environmental reserves the company is subject to losses resulting from extensive and evolving federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations  as well as contract and other disputes 
the company evaluates the potential legal and environmental losses relating to each specific case and determines the probable loss based on historical experience and estimates of cash flows for certain environmental matters 
the estimated losses take into account anticipated costs associated with investigative and remediation efforts where an assessment has indicated that a probable liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
no insurance recovery is taken into account in determining the company s cost estimates or reserve  nor do the company s cost estimates or reserve reflect any discounting for present value purposes  except with respect to long term operations and maintenance cercla matters which are estimated at present value 
the company s estimate of environmental response costs associated with these matters as of december  ranged between million and million 
as of december   the company had a reserve of million for such environmental response costs in the aggregate  which is included in other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
income tax contingencies the company establishes a tax contingency reserve for certain tax exposures when it is not probable that the company s tax position will be ultimately sustained 
the company eliminates a tax contingency reserve balance when it becomes probable that the company s tax position will ultimately be sustained  which generally occurs when the statute of limitations for a specific exposure item has expired or when the company has reached agreement with the taxing authorities on the treatment of an item 
the company generally assesses its tax contingency reserves on a quarterly basis 
management cannot determine with certainty the ultimate resolution of these tax matters

 accounting for stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense for all awards granted after december  is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
the company recognizes stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally five years for stock options and three years for restricted stock 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the company recognized stock based compensation expense by applying the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected pre vesting forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual pre vesting forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from our estimates 
see footnote of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of stock based compensation 

table of contents new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued interpretation fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 by defining a criterion that an individual tax position must meet for any part of the benefit of that position to be recognized in an enterprise s financial statements 
the interpretation would require a review of all tax positions accounted for in accordance with fasb statement no 
and apply a more likely than not recognition threshold 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
subsequent recognition  derecognition  and measurement is based on management s best judgment given the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date 
the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   which the company intends to adopt on january  the company does not believe the new interpretation will have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations  however  adoption may result in the reclassification of certain income tax liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet and an immaterial adjustment to the balance of retained earnings

 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement  and states that a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and the company intends to adopt the standard on january  the company is currently evaluating the impact  if any  that sfas will have on its financial position  results of operations and cash flows  but does not believe the effect will be material

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company s market risk is impacted by changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices 
pursuant to the company s policies  natural hedging techniques and derivative financial instruments may be utilized to reduce the impact of adverse changes in market prices 
the company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
the company manages interest rate exposure through its conservative debt ratio target and its mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
interest rate swaps may be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate based on market conditions  and  for qualifying hedges  the interest differential of swaps is included in interest expense 
the company s foreign exchange risk management policy emphasizes hedging anticipated intercompany and third party commercial transaction exposures of one year duration or less 
the company focuses on natural hedging techniques of the following form offsetting or netting of like foreign currency flows  structuring foreign subsidiary balance sheets with appropriate levels of debt to reduce subsidiary net investments and subsidiary cash flows subject to conversion risk  converting excess foreign currency deposits into us dollars or the relevant functional currency and avoidance of risk by denominating contracts in the appropriate functional currency 
in addition  the company utilizes forward contracts and purchased options to hedge commercial and intercompany transactions 
gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of commercial and intercompany transactions are deferred and included in the basis of the underlying transactions 
derivatives used to hedge intercompany loans are marked to market with the corresponding gains or losses included in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
the company purchases certain raw materials  including resin  corrugate  steel  stainless steel  aluminum and other metals  which are subject to price volatility caused by unpredictable factors 
while future movements of raw material costs are uncertain  a variety of programs  including periodic raw material purchases  purchases of raw materials for future delivery and customer price adjustments help the company address this risk 
where practical  the company uses derivatives as part of its risk management process 
during  the company experienced raw material inflation  which was more than offset by pricing increases  favorable mix and productivity 
the amounts shown below represent the estimated potential economic loss that the company could incur from adverse changes in either interest rates or foreign exchange rates using the value at risk estimation model 
the value at risk model uses historical foreign exchange rates and interest rates to estimate the volatility and correlation 
table of contents of these rates in future periods 
it estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling techniques that are based on a variance covariance approach and includes substantially all market risk exposures specifically excluding equity method investments 
the fair value losses shown in the table below have no impact on results of operations or financial condition  but are shown as an illustration of the impact of potential adverse changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates 
the following table indicates the calculated amounts for each of the years ended december  and in millions  except percentages december  december  confidence market risk average average level interest rates foreign exchange the confidence interval signifies the company s degree of confidence that actual losses would not exceed the estimated losses shown above 
the amounts shown here disregard the possibility that interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could move in the company s favor 
the value at risk model assumes that all movements in these rates will be adverse 
actual experience has shown that gains and losses tend to offset each other over time  and it is highly unlikely that the company could experience losses such as these over an extended period of time 
these amounts should not be considered projections of future losses  because actual results may differ significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets
