table of contents our strategic focus in is to continue to grow our core subscription business and to reduce our cost of deploying and operating our services as a percentage of revenue 
we expect our subscription revenues to increase in compared to  on both an absolute basis and as a percentage of total revenues  due to anticipated growth in demand as well as the gelco acquisition 
we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase on both an absolute basis and as a percentage of revenues in compared to  primarily reflecting our continued emphasis on growing our sales and marketing personnel to support expected demand and create additional awareness in our target market 
we operate in and report on one segment  which is on demand employee spend management solutions

table of contents year ended september  united states europe other total revenues subscription revenues 
subscription revenues consist of fees paid for subscription services  amortization of set up fees paid to us in connection with those services  amortization of fees paid for software maintenance services under software license arrangements and  in multiple element subscription arrangements where there is no vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for an undelivered subscription element  the amortized portion of the related license and consulting fees 
subscription revenues are affected by pricing  the number of new customers  customer contract durations and our customer retention rate 
subscription revenues increased  or million  in compared to revenues from subscription services contributed of the absolute dollar increase in compared to subscription revenues increased  or million  in compared to revenues from subscription services contributed of the absolute dollar increase in compared to an increase in the number of customers for our subscription services was the main reason for the increase 
the growth in customers reflects increased market demand for our subscription services and strong retention of existing subscription customers 
we believe this expansion is due primarily to the market s continued and growing awareness of our on demand employee spend management solutions and the increasing acceptance of outsourced services  driven in part by limited information technology capital budgets 
we expect subscription revenues to continue to grow in  on an absolute basis and as a percentage of total revenues  as a result of the growing demand for our subscription service offerings  our planned increase in spending on sales and marketing as well as the gelco acquisition 
consulting and other revenues 
consulting revenues consist of fees for client services  which include system implementation and integration  planning  data conversion  training and documentation of procedures 
consulting revenues are affected predominantly by the number and complexity of on premise license customer upgrade implementations 
recognition of consulting revenues can also be affected by circumstances in which consulting fees in multiple element arrangements require deferral or are deemed to be subscription related 
other revenues consist of fees earned from sales of our software licenses 
consulting and other revenues decreased in compared to and this was primarily due to a decrease in demand for consulting services as a result of fewer upgrades and enhancements for existing license customers as virtually all of our new customers utilize our subscription services 
we anticipate that consulting and other revenues in will fluctuate on a quarterly basis but be lower for compared to in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues  primarily as a result of fewer existing customers upgrading their on premise license software  fewer new customers purchasing on premise licensed software and the market s continued shift in demand from a licensed model to a subscription services model 
international revenues 
historically  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a material effect on our operating results 
we expect our international revenues to grow in the near term  as our products and services continue to gain acceptance in international markets  due primarily to the expansion of international functionality within our solutions and our increased emphasis on building awareness of our solutions in foreign markets

fees paid to third parties for referrals  resale arrangements and royalties increased  or million  in compared to this increase was due to an increase in the amount of business generated through reseller partners for subscription based sales 
we expect cost of operations expenses to continue to trend down as a percentage of total revenues as the incremental cost to deploy and support each new customer is expected to decrease due to economies of scale 
table of contents anticipated in our subscription service model infrastructure 
we anticipate that cost of operations will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to expand our capacity to deploy and support additional new customers 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries and related expenses including sales commissions and travel related expenses and allocated overhead costs associated with our sales and marketing personnel and  to a lesser extent  miscellaneous sales and marketing costs  such as advertising  trade shows and other promotional activities

we expect total sales and marketing expenses in to increase as a percentage of revenue and in absolute dollars compared to  driven primarily by an increase in sales personnel and marketing programs 
these increases reflect a key part of our strategic focus in  which is to ensure that our sales and marketing efforts are expanded to support expected demand and to create additional awareness in our target markets 
systems development and programming costs

systems development and programming costs were of total revenues in compared to in systems development and programming costs recognized increased  or million  in compared to this increase was primarily due to increased salaries and related expenses of million  offset by the required capitalization of certain costs related to the development of internal use software 
in response to growing demand for our subscription services  we have increased the amount of resources focused on the development and programming of internal use software used to provide these services 
under gaap  costs for software developed or obtained for internal use are required to be capitalized and amortized over their useful lives 
as of september  and  capitalized internal use software costs  net of amortization  totaled million and million 
we anticipate that recognized systems development and programming costs in will increase in absolute dollars and remain relatively consistent as a percentage of revenue compared to as we continue to focus on product innovation and enhancement 

table of contents general and administrative

we expect the absolute dollar amount of general and administrative expenses to increase moderately in compared to due to increases in personnel costs related to the growth of our business 
however  we expect general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue to decrease slightly due to economies of scale 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets represents the amortization of the intangible assets from acquisitions of captura software  inc captura in july  and outtask  inc 
outtask in january we amortized the captura intangible asset as a non cash charge to operations ratably over five years  which was consistent with the timing and level of the expected cash flows from the underlying acquired customer contracts 
we are amortizing the outtask intangible assets as non cash charges to operations over a weighted average life of years  which is consistent with the timing and level of expected cash flows attributed to customer relationships  use of acquired technology  trade name and trademarks  and non compete agreements

table of contents we make estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
the effective income tax rate for the year ended september  was 
we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  including historical levels of income  expectations and risk associated with estimates of future taxable income  ongoing  prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance 
if recovery is not likely  we record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable

the old loan agreement included without limitation  certain restrictions on the use of the borrowing and required compliance with certain financial covenants including certain debt ratios and interest coverage ratios 
as of september   we were in compliance with all loan covenants as required under the terms terms of the old loan agreement 
on june   we terminated our old loan agreement and we rolled our outstanding principal balance of million  into a new credit agreement credit agreement with a different financial institution 
the credit agreement provided for a revolving loan for up to million and expires in june  or such earlier date as provided in the credit agreement 
at our option  the interest rate on the revolving loan is equal to either the greater of the federal funds rate plus and the financial institution s publicly announced prime rate at that time  or the london interbank offered rate libor divided by the result of less the federal reserve system s maximum reserve percentage for eurocurrency funding

table of contents on october   we amended and restated our credit agreement amended credit agreement and incurred additional indebtedness in the aggregate principal amount of million under our amended credit agreement  which increased the revolving facility to up to million and expires in september  or earlier as provided in the amended credit agreement 
such additional indebtedness was used to finance a portion of the total consideration paid at the closing of the gelco acquisition on october  see note subsequent events  of our consolidated financial statements  for additional information 
in january  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program  under which we were authorized to repurchase up to million shares of our outstanding common stock over a two year period expiring in january repurchase program 
in september  our board of directors extended the repurchase program for an additional two year period expiring in january and increased the number of shares eligible for repurchase by million shares 
repurchases under the repurchase program may be made from time to time in the open market based on market conditions 
any repurchases will be made at the then current market prices and repurchased shares will be retired 
during  and  we repurchased and retired shares  shares and  shares of our outstanding common stock under the repurchase program

in the longer term  or if we decide to acquire assets or businesses  we may require additional funds and may seek to raise such additional funds through private or public sales of debt or equity securities  or securities convertible or exchangeable into such securities  strategic relationships  bank debt  lease financing arrangements or other available means 
there can be no assurances that any such funds will be available or  if available  will be on acceptable terms to meet our business needs 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  stockholders may experience dilution  or such equity securities may have rights  preferences  or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock

off balance sheet arrangements none 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial 
table of contents statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  such estimates and judgments are periodically re evaluated 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments or conditions 
the estimates and judgments noted above are affected by our application of accounting policies 
our critical accounting policies are those we deem most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  including those that require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
our critical accounting policies include business combinations  revenue recognition  internal use software  allowances for accounts receivable  share based compensation and income taxes 
business combinations we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
this valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to long lived and intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer contracts  customer lists  distribution agreements  proprietary technology and non compete agreements  the acquired company s brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in our product portfolio  and discount rates 
our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
other estimates associated with the accounting for these acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
revenue recognition we generate our revenues from the delivery of subscription services which include software maintenance services  consulting services and the sale of software licenses 
we recognize revenues in accordance with accounting standards for software and service companies 
we recognize revenue when evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fees are fixed or determinable  and collection is considered probable 
if collection is not considered probable  we recognize revenues when the fees are collected 
if the fees are not fixed or determinable  we recognize revenues as payments become due from the customer 
accordingly  our judgment as to the probability of collection and determinability of fees may materially affect the timing of our revenue recognition and results of operations 
if non standard acceptance periods or non standard performance criteria are required  we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the acceptance period or satisfaction of the acceptance performance criteria  as applicable 
in contractual arrangements that include the provision of multiple elements  we apply the accounting guidance most applicable to the specific arrangement to determine how contract consideration should be 
table of contents measured and allocated to the separate elements in the arrangement 
multiple element arrangements require the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
generally  separate contracts with the same customer that are entered into at or near the same time are presumed to have been negotiated together and  therefore  are accounted for as a single contractual arrangement in determining how contract consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate elements in the arrangement 
typically  we measure and allocate the total arrangement fee among each of the elements based on their fair value or  if necessary  vendor specific objective evidence of their fair value vsoe 
vsoe is determined by the price charged when an element is sold separately or  in the case of an element not yet sold separately  the price set by authorized management  if it is probable that the price  once established  will not materially change prior to separate market introduction 
subscription revenues our subscription revenues are typically recognized monthly as the service is provided to the customer and consist of monthly fees paid for subscription services  amortization of related set up fees  amortization of fees paid for software maintenance services under software license arrangements  and the amortized portion of the related license and consulting fees in certain multiple element subscription arrangements where vsoe does not exist for an undelivered subscription element 
set up fees paid by customers in connection with subscription services  as well as the associated direct and incremental costs  such as labor and commissions  are deferred and recognized ratably over the longer of the contractual lives  or the expected lives of the customer relationships  which generally range from two to five years 
for those subscription service offerings that have been commercially available for only a short period of time  the contractual lives are used as the best estimate of the expected lives of the customer relationships 
we continue to evaluate and adjust the length of these amortization periods as we gain more experience with customer contract renewals and contract cancellations 
it is possible that  in the future  the estimates of expected customer lives may change and  if so  the periods over which such subscription set up fees and costs are amortized will be adjusted 
any such change in estimated expected customer lives will affect our future results of operations 
software maintenance services include technical support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades and enhancements on a when and if available basis 
fees for software maintenance services are typically billed annually in advance of performance of the services with provisions for subsequent automatic annual renewals 
we defer the related revenues and recognize them ratably over the respective maintenance terms  which typically are one year 
subscription revenues are adjusted for estimated sales allowances  which are based on our historical experience  including a review of our experience related to price adjustments and sales credits issued 
consulting and other revenues consulting revenues consist of fees for professional services  which relate to system implementation and integration  planning  data conversion  training and documentation of procedures 
consulting service fees are typically billed and recognized as revenue on a time and materials basis 
in some instances  we sell consulting services under milestone or fixed fee contracts and  in such cases  recognize consulting revenues on a percentage of completion basis 
consulting revenues are adjusted for estimated sales allowances  which are based on our historical experience  including a review of our experience related to price adjustments and sales credits issued 

table of contents in service arrangements that include consulting and subscription services  but not a license of our software  we recognize consulting revenues as they are performed if the consulting services qualify as a separate unit of accounting within the arrangement 
the consulting services qualify as a separate unit of accounting if they have value to the customer on a stand alone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the subscription services and delivery or performance of the subscription services is considered probable and substantially within our control 
we have determined that  in our service arrangements of this type  the consulting services typically qualify as a separate unit of accounting and  accordingly  the consulting revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
if the consulting services do not qualify as a separate unit of accounting  the related revenues are combined with the subscription revenues and recognized ratably over the subscription service period 
our judgment as to whether the consulting services qualify as a separate unit of accounting may materially affect the timing of our revenue recognition and our results of operations 
other revenues consist of fees earned from  and allocable to  grants of licenses to use our software products 
we recognize license revenues when evidence of a license arrangement exists  we have delivered the software  the amount of the transaction is fixed or determinable  collection is probable and vsoe exists for any undelivered elements of the arrangement 
elements included in our multiple element software arrangements consist of various licensed software products and services such as software maintenance services  consulting services and subscription services 
in software license arrangements that include rights to multiple elements  we allocate the total arrangement fee among each of the elements using the residual method  under which revenues are allocated to undelivered elements based on vsoe and the residual amounts of revenue are allocated to the delivered elements 
if sufficient vsoe does not exist for the allocation of revenue to the various elements of the arrangement  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until the earlier of the point at which such sufficient vsoe does exist or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered 
if the only undelivered element is software maintenance  the entire fee is recognized ratably as subscription revenue 
we are required to exercise judgment in deciding how to interpret the evidence of fair value to determine the allocation of arrangement consideration with respect to a given element and in determining whether an established price is likely to change prior to separate market introduction 
these judgments may materially affect the timing of our revenue recognition and results of operations 
in software license arrangements where we also provide consulting services  license revenues are recognized upon delivery of the software  provided that the criteria for recognition of software license revenues described above are met  payment of the license fees is not dependent upon the performance of the consulting services and the consulting services are not essential to the functionality of the software 
if we determine that the consulting services are essential to the functionality of the software  or payment of the license fees is dependent upon the performance of the consulting services  then both the license and consulting fees are recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
we typically do not consider the consulting services we provide in such arrangements to be essential to the functionality of the software and  therefore  license revenues are typically recognized upon delivery of the software and consulting revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
accordingly  our judgment as to whether consulting services should be considered essential to the functionality of the licensed software may materially affect the timing of our revenue recognition and results of operations 
in arrangements where we license our software and also host the licensed software for our customer  a software element is only considered present if our customer has the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty  and it is feasible for our customer to either operate the software on its own hardware or contract with another vendor to host the software 
if the arrangement meets these criteria  as well as the other criteria for recognition of license revenues described above  we deem there to be software element present and recognize license revenues when the software is delivered and we recognize the subscription hosting revenues as the hosting service is provided 
hosting set up fees for such arrangements  as well as the associated direct and incremental costs  are deferred and recognized ratably over the hosting service period 
if we determine that a separate software element as described above is not present  we 
table of contents combine the software license fees with the subscription hosting fees and recognize them ratably over the subscription service period  as subscription revenue 
our judgment as to whether we meet the criteria above could have a material affect on the timing and mix of our revenue recognition and on our results of operations 
portions of our revenues are generated from sales made through our reseller partners 
when we assume a majority of the business risks associated with performance of the contractual obligations  we record the revenues on a gross basis and amounts paid to our reseller partners are recognized as cost of operations 
our assumption of such business risks is evidenced when  among other things  we take responsibility for delivery of the product or service  establish pricing of the arrangement and are the primary obligor in the arrangement 
when our reseller partner assumes the majority of the business risks associated with the performance of the contractual obligations  we record the associated revenues net of the amounts paid to our reseller partner 
our judgment as to whether we have assumed the majority of the business risks associated with performance of the contractual obligations materially affects how we report revenues and cost of operations 
internal use software we capitalize certain costs of software developed or obtained for internal use in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for the costs of corporate software developed or obtained for internal use 
we capitalize software development costs when application development begins and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used as intended 
costs associated with preliminary project stage activities  training  maintenance and all other post implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred 
our policy provides for the capitalization of certain payroll and payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computer software projects  as well as external direct costs of materials and services associated with developing or obtaining internal use software 
capitalizable personnel costs are limited to the time directly spent on such projects 
capitalized costs are ratably amortized  using the straight line method  over the estimated useful lives of the related applications which typically range from two to five years 
our judgment as to which costs to capitalize  when to begin capitalizing such costs  and what period to amortize the costs over  may materially affect our results of operations 
accounts receivable allowances we record provisions for estimated sales allowances against subscription and consulting revenues in the period in which the related revenues are recorded 
we record our sales allowances based on historical experience  including a review of our experience related to price adjustments and sales credits issued 
we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables  and we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts  included in general and administrative expenses 
in estimating allowances for doubtful accounts  we consider specific receivables when collection is doubtful  as well as an analysis of our historical bad debt experience and the current economic environment 
if the data used to estimate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not adequately reflect our future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and future results of operations could be materially affected 
share based compensation our equity compensation program is a broad based  long term retention program that is intended to attract and retain talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests 
we rely primarily on four equity compensation plans that provide broad discretion to our board of directors to create appropriate equity incentives for members of our board of directors and our employees 
on october   we adopted the provisions of sfas r  share based payment sfas r  requiring us to recognize expense related to the fair value of our share based compensation awards 
we elected the modified prospective transition method as permitted by sfas r 
under this transition method  stock based compensation expense for the year ended 
table of contents september   includes compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of october   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation sfas  and compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted subsequent to october   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
in accordance with sfas r  we capitalize the portion of our share based compensation attributed to internally developed software and defer the portion of our share based compensation associated with activities that generate deferred revenue 
under the provisions of sfas r  our employee stock purchase plan is deemed non compensatory 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further detail  including the impact of the adoption of sfas r to our income statements 
income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  including historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
if recovery is not likely  we record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
a release of valuation allowance as a result of an acquisition is recorded as reduction of goodwill recognized in the acquisition rather than a tax benefit in the income statement 
as of september   we believe it is more likely than not that the amount of the deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet will ultimately be recovered 
however  should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that recovery is not probable 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business 
these risks include primarily interest rate and foreign exchange risks 
interest rate risk 
we have borrowing arrangements with variable rates of interest 
we also maintain cash in highly liquid investment vehicles including money market accounts  which bear interest at variable overnight or short term rates 
variable interest rate investment and debt exposes us to differences in future cash flows resulting from changes in market interest rates 
variable interest rate risk can be quantified by estimating the change in cash flows resulting from a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates 
as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  our credit facility bears interest at floating rates we select under the terms of the credit agreement 
as of september   we had million outstanding on the credit agreement 
the credit facility is not hedged with an interest rate swap 
on an annual basis  a basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate change to annual interest expense  based upon net variable rate borrowings of million 
foreign currency risk 
we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
we do not believe movements in the foreign currencies in which we transact will significantly affect future net earnings 
foreign currency risk can be quantified by estimating the change in cash flows resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates 
we believe such a change would not have a material impact on our cash flows of financial instruments that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange risk 
derivatives 
we do not use derivative financial instruments
