during the same period  the company acquired apartment communities containing  units 
the company and its affiliates have sold apartment communities after holding them for investment periods that generally range up to twenty years after acquisition or development 
the following table shows a summary of the company s development and sales activity during these periods 
units developed and completed units acquired units sold units sold as condominiums or currently being converted into for sale condominiums total units completed and owned by the company and its affiliates including units held for sale at year end total revenues from continuing operations in thousands excludes units currently in lease up  as the community was undergoing renovation upon purchase

table of contents current development activity at december   the company had three communities and one community expansion under development and lease up  containing  apartment units  and for sale condominium homes under development in two communities 
these communities are summarized in the table below

there can be no assurance that condominium homes under contract will close 
total estimated construction costs for the post hyde park expansion include the estimated replacement costs of six apartment units at the company s existing hyde park community that are being demolished to accommodate the expansion 
competition all of the company s apartment and for sale condominium communities are located in developed markets that include other upscale apartments and for sale condominium projects owned by numerous public and private companies 
some of these companies may have substantially greater resources and greater access to capital than the company  allowing them to grow at rates greater than the company 
the number of competitive upscale apartment and for sale condominium properties and companies in a particular market could have a material effect on the company s ability to lease apartment units at its apartment communities  including any newly developed or acquired communities  and on the rents charged  and could have a material effect on the company s ability to sell for sale condominium units and on the selling prices of such units 
in addition  other forms of residential properties  including single family housing and town homes  provide housing alternatives to potential residents of upscale apartment communities or potential purchasers of for sale condominium units 
the company competes for residents in its apartment communities based on its high level of resident service  the quality of its apartment communities including its landscaping and amenity offerings and the desirability of its locations 
resident leases at its apartment communities are priced competitively based on market conditions  supply and demand characteristics  and the quality and resident service offerings of its communities 
the company does not seek to compete on the basis of providing the low cost solution for all residents 
americans with disabilities act and fair housing act the company s multi family housing communities and any newly acquired multi family housing communities must comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act the ada to the extent that such properties are public accommodations and or commercial facilities as defined by the ada 
compliance with the ada requirements could require removal of structural barriers to handicapped access in certain public areas of the company s multi family housing communities where such removal is readily achievable 
the ada does not  however  consider residential properties  such as multi family housing communities  to be public accommodations or commercial facilities  except to the extent portions of such facilities  such as the leasing office  are open to the public 
the company must also comply post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp 
table of contents with the fair housing amendment act of  or the fhaa  which requires that apartment communities first occupied after march  be accessible to persons with disabilities 
noncompliance with the fhaa and ada could result in the imposition of fines  awards of damages to private litigants  payment of attorneys fees and other costs to plaintiffs  substantial litigation costs and substantial costs of remediation 
compliance with the fhaa could require removal of structural barriers to handicapped access in a community  including the interiors of multi family housing units covered under the fhaa 
in addition to the ada and fhaa  state and local laws exist that impact the company s multi family housing communities with respect to access thereto by persons with disabilities 
further  legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose additional burdens or restrictions on the company with respect to improved access by persons with disabilities 
the ada  fhaa  or other existing or new legislation may require the company to modify its existing properties 
these laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings or may require the company to add other structural features that increase its construction costs 
recently there has been heightened scrutiny of multifamily housing communities for compliance with the requirements of the fhaa and ada 
in november  the equal rights center  or erc  filed a lawsuit against the company and the operating partnership alleging various violations of the fhaa and the ada at certain properties designed  constructed or operated by the company and the operating partnership 
the erc seeks compensatory and punitive damages in unspecified amounts  an award of attorneys fees and costs of suit  as well as preliminary and permanent injunctive relief that includes retrofitting multi family housing units and public use areas to comply with the fhaa and ada and prohibiting construction or sale of noncompliant units or complexes 
due to the preliminary nature of the litigation  it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of the legal proceeding  nor is it possible to estimate the amount of loss  if any  that would be associated with an adverse decision 
the company cannot ascertain the ultimate cost of compliance with the ada  fhaa or other similar state and local legislation and such costs are not likely covered by insurance policies 
the cost associated with ongoing litigation or compliance could be substantial and could adversely effect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
environmental regulations the company is subject to federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances  and regulations that apply to the development of real property  including construction activities  the ownership of real property  and the operation of multifamily apartment and for sale condominium communities 
the company has instituted a policy that requires an environmental investigation of each property that it considers for purchase or that it owns and plans to develop 
the environmental investigation is conducted by a qualified third party environmental consultant in accordance with recognized industry standards 
the environmental investigation report is reviewed by the company and counsel prior to purchase and or development of any property 
if the environmental investigation identifies evidence of potentially significant environmental contamination that merits additional investigation  sampling of the property is performed by the environmental consultant 
if necessary  remediation or mitigation of contamination  including removal of contaminated soil and or underground storage tanks  placement of impervious barriers  or creation of land use or deed restrictions  is undertaken either prior to development or at another appropriate time 
when performing remediation activities  the company is subject to a variety of environmental requirements 
in some cases  the company obtains state approval of the selected remediation and mitigation measures by entering into voluntary environmental cleanup programs administered by state agencies 
in developing properties and constructing apartment and for sale condominium communities  the company utilizes independent environmental consultants to determine whether there are any flood plains  wetlands or other environmentally sensitive areas that are part of the property to be developed 
if flood plains are identified  development and construction work is planned so that flood plain areas are preserved or alternative flood plain capacity is created in conformance with federal and local flood plain management requirements 
if wetlands or other environmentally sensitive areas are identified  the company plans and conducts its development and construction activities and obtains the necessary permits and authorizations in compliance with applicable legal standards 
in some cases  however  the presence of wetlands and or other environmentally sensitive areas could preclude  severely limit  or otherwise alter the proposed site development and construction activities 
storm water discharge from a construction site is subject to the storm water permit requirements mandated under the clean water act 
in most jurisdictions  the state administers the permit programs 
the company currently anticipates that it will be able to obtain and materially comply with any storm water permits required for new development 
the company post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp 
table of contents has obtained and is in material compliance with the construction site storm water permits required for its existing development activities 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  usc sec 
et seq 
cercla  and comparable state laws subject the owner or operator of real property or a facility and persons who arranged for off site disposal activities to claims or liability for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances that are released at  in  on  under  or from real property or a facility 
in addition to claims for cleanup costs  the presence of hazardous substances on or the release of hazardous substances from a property or a facility could result in a claim by a private party for personal injury or property damage or could result in a claim from a governmental agency for other damages  including natural resource damages 
liability under cercla and comparable state laws can be imposed on the owner or the operator of real property or a facility without regard to fault or even knowledge of the release of hazardous substances and other regulated materials on  at  in  under  or from the property or facility 
environmental liabilities associated with hazardous substances also could be imposed on the company under other applicable environmental laws  such as the resource conservation and recovery act and comparable state laws  or common law principles 
the presence of hazardous substances in amounts requiring response action or the failure to undertake necessary remediation may adversely affect the owner s ability to use or sell real estate or borrow money using such real estate as collateral 
various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the company s ongoing operation of its communities 
such environmental laws include those regulating the existence of asbestos containing materials in buildings  management of surfaces with lead based paint and notices to residents about the lead based paint  use of active underground petroleum storage tanks  and waste management activities 
the failure to comply with such requirements could subject the company to a government enforcement action and or claims for damages by a private party 
the company has not been notified by any governmental authority of any material noncompliance  claim  or liability in connection with environmental conditions associated with any of its apartment and for sale condominium communities 
the company has not been notified of a material claim for personal injury or property damage by a private party relating to any of its apartment and for sale condominium communities in connection with environmental conditions 
the company is not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of its apartment and for sale condominium communities that could be considered to be material 
it is possible  however  that the environmental investigations of the company s properties might not have revealed all potential environmental liabilities associated with the company s real property and its apartment and for sale condominium communities or the company might have underestimated any potential environmental issues identified in the investigations 
it is also possible that future environmental laws  ordinances  or regulations or new interpretations of existing environmental laws  ordinances  or regulations will impose material environmental liabilities on the company  the current environmental conditions of properties that the company owns or operates will be affected adversely by hazardous substances associated with other nearby properties or the actions of third parties unrelated to the company  or our residents and or commercial tenants may engage in activities prohibited by their leases or otherwise expose the company to liability under applicable environmental laws  ordinances  or regulations 
the costs of defending any future environmental claims  performing any future environmental remediation  satisfying any such environmental liabilities  or responding to any changed environmental conditions could materially adversely affect the company s financial conditions and results of operations

risk factors dollars in thousands  except per share amounts the following risk factors apply to post properties  inc the company and post apartment homes  lp the operating partnership 
all indebtedness described in the risk factors has been incurred by the operating partnership 
unfavorable changes in apartment markets and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy levels and rental rates 
market and economic conditions in the various metropolitan areas of the united states where the company operates  particularly atlanta  georgia  dallas  texas  tampa  florida and the greater washington  dc area where a substantial post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp 
table of contents majority of the company s apartment communities are located  may significantly affect occupancy levels and rental rates and therefore profitability 
factors that may adversely affect these conditions include the following the economic climate  which may be adversely impacted by a reduction in jobs  industry slowdowns and other factors  local conditions  such as oversupply of  or reduced demand for  apartment homes  declines in household formation  favorable residential mortgage rates  rent control or stabilization laws  or other laws regulating rental housing  which could prevent the company from raising rents to offset increases in operating costs  and competition from other available apartments and other housing alternatives and changes in market rental rates 
any of these factors could adversely affect the company s ability to achieve desired operating results from its communities 
development and construction risks could impact the company s profitability 
the company intends to continue to develop and construct apartment communities and may convert existing apartment communities into condominiums or develop for sale condominium housing 
development activities may be conducted through wholly owned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties 
the company s development and construction activities may be exposed to the following risks the company may be unable to obtain  or face delays in obtaining  necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy  and other required governmental permits and authorizations  which could result in increased development costs  the company may incur construction costs for a property that exceed original estimates due to increased materials  labor or other costs or unforeseen environmental conditions  which could make completion of the property uneconomical  and the company may not be able to increase rents or for sale condominium unit sales prices to compensate for the increase in construction costs  the company may abandon development opportunities that it has already begun to explore  and it may fail to recover expenses already incurred in connection with exploring those opportunities  causing potential impairment losses to be incurred  the company has at times been and may continue to be unable to complete construction and lease up of a community on schedule and meet financial goals for development projects  because occupancy rates and rents at a newly developed community may fluctuate depending on a number of factors  including market and economic conditions  the company may be unable to meet its profitability goals for that community  and land costs and construction costs have been increasing in the company s markets  and may continue to increase in the future and  in some cases  the costs of upgrading acquired communities have  and may continue to  exceed original estimates and the company may be unable to charge rents  or sales prices with respect to for sale condominium product  that would compensate for these increases in costs 
possible difficulty of selling apartment communities could limit the company s operational and financial flexibility 
purchasers may not be willing to pay acceptable prices for apartment communities that the company wishes to sell 
a weak market may limit the company s ability to change its portfolio promptly in response to changing economic conditions 
also  if the company is unable to sell apartment communities or if it can only sell apartment communities at prices lower than are generally acceptable  then the company may have to take on additional leverage in order to provide adequate capital to execute its development and construction and acquisitions strategy 
furthermore  a portion of the proceeds from the company s overall property sales in the future may be held in escrow accounts in order for some sales to qualify as like kind exchanges under section of the internal revenue code so that any related capital gain can be deferred for federal income tax purposes 
as a result  the company may not have immediate access to all of the cash flow generated from property sales 
post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp 
table of contents the company is subject to increased exposure to economic and other competitive factors due to the concentration of its investments in certain markets 
at december   approximately   and on a unit basis of the company s communities were located in the atlanta  georgia  dallas  texas  greater washington  dc and tampa  florida metropolitan areas  respectively 
the company is therefore subject to increased exposure to economic and other competitive factors specific to its markets within these geographic areas 
failure to generate sufficient cash flows could affect the company s debt financing and create refinancing risk 
the company is subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing  including the risk that its cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest 
although the company may be able to use cash flow generated by its apartment communities or through the sale of for sale condominium housing to make future principal payments  it may not have sufficient cash flow to be available to make all required principal payments and still meet the distribution requirements that the company must satisfy in order to maintain its status as a real estate investment trust or reit for federal income tax purposes 
the following factors  among others  may affect the cash flows generated by the company s apartment communities and through the sale of for sale condominium housing the national and local economies  local real estate market conditions  such as an oversupply of apartment homes or competing for sale condominium housing  the perceptions by prospective residents or buyers of the safety  convenience and attractiveness of the company s communities and the neighborhoods in which they are located  the company s ability to provide adequate management  maintenance and insurance for its apartment communities  rental expenses for its apartment communities  including real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  and the level of mortgage interest rates and its impact on the demand for prospective buyers of for sale condominium housing 
expenses associated with the company s investment in apartment communities  such as debt service  real estate taxes  insurance and maintenance costs  are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in cash flows from operations from that community 
if a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and the company is unable to make the mortgage payments  the company could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgagee 
the company is likely to need to refinance at least a portion of its outstanding debt as it matures 
there is a risk that the company may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt 
as of december   the company had outstanding mortgage indebtedness of  of which approximately  matures in  senior unsecured debt of  of which  matures in and unsecured line of credit borrowings of the company could become more highly leveraged which could result in an increased risk of default and in an increase in its debt service requirements 
the company s stated goal is to generally maintain total effective leverage debt and preferred equity as a percentage of undepreciated real estate assets to not more than  to generally limit variable rate indebtedness as a percentage of total indebtedness to not more than of aggregate indebtedness  and to maintain adequate liquidity through the company s unsecured lines of credit 
at december   the company s total effective leverage debt and preferred equity as a percentage of undepreciated real estate assets and the company s total variable rate indebtedness as a percentage of total indebtedness were below these percentages 
if management adjusts the company s stated goal in the future  the company could become more highly leveraged  resulting in an increase in debt service that could adversely affect funds from operations  the company s ability to make expected distributions to its shareholders and the operating partnership s ability to make expected distributions to its limited partners and in an increased risk of default on the obligations of the company and the operating partnership 
in addition  the company s and the operating partnership s ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in bank and other credit agreements and in the company s outstanding senior unsecured notes 
the company manages its debt to be in compliance with its stated policy and with these debt covenants  but subject to compliance with these covenants  the company may increase the amount of outstanding debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in the company s ability to service the additional debt 
accordingly  the company could become more post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp 
table of contents leveraged  resulting in an increased risk of default on its obligations and in an increase in debt service requirements  both of which could adversely affect the company s financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future 
debt financing may not be available and equity issuances could be dilutive to the company s shareholders 
the company s ability to execute its business strategy depends on its access to an appropriate blend of debt financing  including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt  and equity financing  including common and preferred equity 
debt financing may not be available in sufficient amounts  or on favorable terms or at all 
if the company issues additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt  the interests of existing shareholders could be diluted 
the company s condominium conversion and for sale condominium housing business involves unique business risks and challenges 
the company s ability to successfully complete a condominium conversion or other for sale housing project  sell the units and achieve management s economic goals in connection with the transaction is subject to various risks and challenges  which if they materialize  may have an adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition including the inability to obtain approvals to rezone the property and releases from financing obligations and increases in costs resulting from delays in obtaining such approvals and releases  understanding the costs necessary to bring a newly developed or converted for sale condominium property up to standards required for its intended market position  lack of demand by prospective buyers  oversupply of condominiums in a given market  the inability of buyers to qualify for financing  lower than anticipated sale prices  the inability to close on sales of individual units under contract  competition from other condominiums and other types of residential housing  and liability claims from condominium associations or others asserting that construction performed was defective  resulting in litigation and or settlement discussions 
in general  profits realized to date from the company s sale of condominium homes have been more volatile than the company s core apartment rental operations 
in addition  the company believes that the demand of prospective buyers  the supply and competition from other condominiums and other types of residential housing  and the level of mortgage interest rates and the affordability of housing  among other factors  could have a significant impact on its ability to sell for sale units and on the sales prices achieved 
if the company is unable to sell for sale condominium homes  the company could decide to rent unsold units or could cause a condominium community to revert to a rental apartment community 
if these risks were to materialize  it could cause the company to realize impairment losses in future periods and it could cause economic returns that are materially lower than anticipated 
in addition  if the company is unable to sell for sale units  the expenses and carrying costs associated with the ownership of such units would continue 
acquired apartment communities may not achieve anticipated results 
the company may selectively acquire apartment communities that meet its investment criteria 
the company s acquisition activities and their success may be exposed to the following risks an acquired community may fail to achieve expected occupancy and rental rates and may fail to perform as expected  the company may not be able to successfully integrate acquired properties and operations  and the company s estimates of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping the acquired property may prove inaccurate  causing the company to fail to meet its profitability goals 
post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp 
table of contents increased competition and increased affordability of residential homes could limit the company s ability to retain its residents  lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents 
the company s apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents  including other apartment communities and single family rental homes  as well as owner occupied single and multi family homes 
competitive housing in a particular area and the increasing affordability of owner occupied single and multi family homes caused by declining housing prices  mortgage interest rates and government programs to promote home ownership could adversely affect the company s ability to retain its residents  lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents 
limited investment opportunities could adversely affect the company s growth 
the company expects that other real estate investors will compete to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties 
these competitors include insurance companies  pension and investment funds  developer partnerships  investment companies and other apartment reits 
this competition could increase prices for properties of the type that the company would likely pursue  and competitors may have greater resources than the company 
as a result  the company may not be able to make attractive investments on favorable terms  which could adversely affect its growth 
the company may not be able to maintain its current dividend level 
for the full year of  management of the company currently expects to maintain its current quarterly dividend payment rate to common shareholders of per share 
at this dividend rate  the company currently expects that net cash flows from operations reduced by annual operating capital expenditures for will not be sufficient to fund the dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders by approximately  to  the company intends to use primarily the proceeds from asset including condominium sales to fund the additional cash flow necessary to fully fund the dividend payments to common shareholders 
in prior periods  the additional funding  in excess of cash flows from operating activities less operating capital expenditures  required to pay the quarterly dividends was funded through a combination of line of credit borrowings and proceeds from asset sales 
the company s board of directors reviews the dividend quarterly  and there can be no assurance that the current dividend level will be maintained 
changing interest rates could increase interest costs and could affect the market price of the company s securities 
the company has incurred  and expects to continue to incur  debt bearing interest at rates that vary with market interest rates 
therefore  if interest rates increase  the company s interest costs will rise to the extent its variable rate debt is not hedged effectively 
further  while the company s stated goal is to limit variable rate debt to not more than of total indebtedness  management may adjust these levels over time 
in addition  an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of the company s securities to demand a higher annual yield  which could adversely affect the market price of the company s common and preferred stock and debt securities 
interest rate hedging contracts may be ineffective and may result in material charges 
from time to time when the company anticipates issuing debt securities  it may seek to limit exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts 
the company may do this to increase the predictability of its financing costs 
also  from time to time  the company may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit its exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates 
if the pricing of new debt securities is not within the parameters of  or market interest rates produce a lower interest cost than the company incurs under  a particular interest rate hedging contract  the contract may be ineffective 
furthermore  the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has at times involved and may in the future involve material charges 
these charges are typically related to the extent and timing of fluctuations in interest rates 
despite the company s efforts to minimize its exposure to interest rate fluctuations  the company cannot guarantee that it will maintain coverage for all of its outstanding indebtedness at any particular time 
if the company does not effectively protect itself from this risk  it may be subject to increased interest costs resulting from interest rate fluctuations 
failure to succeed in new markets may limit the company s growth 
the company may from time to time commence development activity or make acquisitions outside of its existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise 
the company s historical experience in its existing markets does not ensure that it post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp 
table of contents will be able to operate successfully in new markets 
the company may be exposed to a variety of risks if it chooses to enter new markets 
these risks include  among others an inability to evaluate accurately local apartment or for sale condominium housing market conditions and local economies  an inability to obtain land for development or to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities  an inability to hire and retain key personnel  and lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures 
compliance or failure to comply with laws requiring access to the company s properties by persons with disabilities could result in substantial cost 
the company s multi family housing communities and any newly acquired multi family housing communities must comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act  or the ada  to the extent that such properties are public accommodations and or commercial facilities as defined by the ada 
compliance with the ada requirements could require removal of structural barriers to handicapped access in certain public areas of the company s multi family housing communities where such removal is readily achievable 
the ada does not  however  consider residential properties  such as multi family housing communities to be public accommodations or commercial facilities  except to the extent portions of such facilities  such as the leasing office  are open to the public 
the company must also comply with the fair housing amendment act of  or the fhaa  which requires that multi family housing communities first occupied after march  be accessible to persons of disabilities 
noncompliance with the fhaa and ada could result in the imposition of fines  awards of damages to private litigants  payment of attorneys fees and other costs to plaintiffs  substantial litigation costs and substantial costs of remediation 
compliance with the fhaa could require removal of structural barriers to handicapped access in a community  including the interiors of apartment units covered under the fhaa 
in addition to the ada and fhaa  state and local laws exist that impact the company s multi family housing communities with respect to access thereto by persons with disabilities 
further  legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose additional burdens or restrictions on the company with respect to improved access by persons with disabilities 
the ada  fhaa  or other existing or new legislation may require the company to modify its existing properties 
these laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings or may require the company to add other structural features that increase its construction costs 
recently there has been heightened scrutiny of multifamily housing communities for compliance with the requirements of the fhaa and ada 
in november  the equal rights center  or erc  filed a lawsuit against the company and the operating partnership alleging various violations of the fhaa and the ada at certain properties designed  constructed or operated by the company and the operating partnership 
the erc seeks compensatory and punitive damages in unspecified amounts  an award of attorneys fees and costs of suit  as well as preliminary and permanent injunctive relief that includes retrofitting multi family housing units and public use areas to comply with the fhaa and ada and prohibiting construction or sale of noncompliant units or complexes 
due to the preliminary nature of the litigation  it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of the legal proceeding  nor is it possible to estimate the amount of loss  if any  that would be associated with an adverse decision 
the company cannot ascertain the ultimate cost of compliance with the ada  fhaa or other similar state and local legislation and such costs are not likely covered by insurance policies 
the cost associated with ongoing litigation or compliance could be substantial and could adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
any weaknesses identified in the company s system of internal controls by the company and its independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires that companies evaluate and report on their systems of internal control over financial reporting 
in addition  the company s independent registered public accounting firm must report on management s evaluation of those controls 
in future periods  the company may identify deficiencies in its system of internal controls over financial reporting that may require remediation 
there can be no assurances that any such future deficiencies identified may not be material weaknesses that would be required to be reported in future periods

table of contents losses from natural catastrophes may exceed insurance coverage 
the company carries comprehensive liability  fire  flood  extended coverage and rental loss insurance on its properties  which are believed to be of the type and amount customarily obtained on real property assets 
the company intends to obtain similar coverage for properties acquired or developed in the future 
however  some losses  generally of a catastrophic nature  such as losses from floods or wind storms  may be subject to limitations 
the company exercises discretion in determining amounts  coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance  with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance on its investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms  however  the company may not be able to maintain its insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect it against potential losses 
further  the company s insurance costs could increase in future periods 
if the company suffers a substantial loss  its insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of the lost investment 
inflation  changes in building codes and ordinances  environmental considerations and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed 
potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs 
the company is in the business of owning  operating  developing  acquiring and  from time to time  selling real estate 
under various federal  state and local environmental laws  as a current or former owner or operator  the company could be required to investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances  often regardless of its knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of its current or former ownership or operation of the real estate 
in addition  the company could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties for property and other damages and for investigation and clean up costs incurred in connection with the contamination 
these costs could be substantial  and in many cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment 
the presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely affect the company s ability to borrow against  sell or rent an affected property 
costs associated with moisture infiltration and resulting mold remediation may be costly 
as a general matter  concern about indoor exposure to mold has been increasing as such exposure has been alleged to have a variety of adverse effects on health 
as a result  there has been a number of lawsuits in the company s industry against owners and managers of apartment communities relating to moisture infiltration and resulting mold 
the company has implemented guidelines and procedures to address moisture infiltration and resulting mold issues if and when they arise 
the company believes that these measures will minimize the potential for any adverse effect on its residents 
the terms of its property and general liability policies generally exclude certain mold related claims 
should an uninsured loss arise against the company  the company would be required to use its funds to resolve the issue  including litigation costs 
the company makes no assurance that liabilities resulting from moisture infiltration and the presence of or exposure to mold will not have a future impact on its business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company s joint ventures and joint ownership of properties and partial interests in corporations and limited partnerships could limit the company s ability to control such properties and partial interests 
instead of purchasing certain apartment communities directly  the company has invested and may continue to invest as a co venturer 
joint venturers often have shared control over the operations of the joint venture assets 
therefore  it is possible that the co venturer in an investment might become bankrupt  or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with the company s business interests or goals  or be in a position to take action contrary to the company s instructions  requests  policies or objectives 
consequently  a co venturer s actions might subject property owned by the joint venture to additional risk 
although the company seeks to maintain sufficient influence of any joint venture to achieve its objectives  the company may be unable to take action without the company s joint venture partners approval  or joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without the company s consent 
additionally  should a joint venture partner become bankrupt  the company could become liable for such partner s share of joint venture liabilities 
the company may be unable to renew leases or relet units as leases expire 
when the company s residents decide not to renew their leases upon expiration  the company may not be able to relet their units 
even if the residents do renew or the company can relet the units  the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable than current leases terms 
because virtually all of the company s leases are for apartments  they are generally for no more than one year 
if the company is unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the units  or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates  then the company s results of operations and post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp 
table of contents financial condition will be adversely affected 
consequently  the company s cash flow and ability to service debt and make distributions to security holders would be reduced 
the company may fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
the company s qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes depends upon its ability to meet on a continuing basis  through actual annual operating results  distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership  the various qualification tests and organizational requirements imposed upon reits under the internal revenue code 
the company believes that it has qualified for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes commencing with its taxable year ended december   and plans to continue to meet the requirements to qualify as a reit in the future 
many of these requirements  however  are highly technical and complex 
therefore  the company may not have qualified or may not continue to qualify in the future as a reit 
the determination that the company qualifies as a reit for federal income tax purposes requires an analysis of various factual matters that may not be totally within the company s control 
even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize the company s reit status 
furthermore  congress and the irs might make changes to the tax laws and regulations  and the courts might issue new decisions that make it more difficult  or impossible  for the company to remain qualified as a reit 
the company does not believe  however  that any pending or proposed tax law changes would jeopardize its reit status 
if the company were to fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year  and certain relief provisions of the internal revenue code did not apply  the company would be subject to tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates  leaving less money available for distributions to its shareholders 
in addition  distributions to shareholders in any year in which the company failed to qualify would not be deductible by the company for federal income tax purposes nor would they be required to be made 
unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions  the company also would be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which it ceased to qualify as a reit 
it is not possible to predict whether in all circumstances the company would be entitled to such statutory relief 
the company s failure to qualify as a reit likely would have a significant adverse effect on the value of its securities 
the operating partnership may fail to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
management believes that the operating partnership qualifies  and has so qualified since its formation  as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and not as a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation 
no assurance can be provided  however  that the irs will not challenge the treatment of the operating partnership as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge 
if the irs were successful in treating the operating partnership as a corporation for federal income tax purposes  then the taxable income of the operating partnership would be taxable at regular corporate income tax rates 
in addition  the treatment of the operating partnership as a corporation would cause the company to fail to qualify as a reit 
see the company may fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes above 
the company s real estate assets may be subject to impairment charges 
the company continually evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of its real estate assets for impairment indicators 
factors considered in evaluating impairment of the company s existing real estate assets held for investment include significant declines in property operating profits  recurring property operating losses and other significant adverse changes in general market conditions that are considered permanent in nature 
generally  a real estate asset held for investment is not considered impaired if the undiscounted  estimated future cash flows of the asset over its estimated holding period are in excess of the asset s net book value at the balance sheet date 
assumptions used to estimate annual and residual cash flow and the estimated holding period of such assets require the judgment of management 
in and in prior years  the company recorded impairment charges on assets held for investment and assets designated as held for sale 
there can be no assurance that the company will not take additional charges in the future related to the impairment of its assets 
for the years ended december   and  management believes it has applied reasonable estimates and judgments in determining the proper classification of its real estate assets 
however  should external or internal circumstances change requiring the need to shorten the holding periods or adjust the estimated future cash flows of certain of the company s assets  the company could be required to record additional impairment charges 
if any real estate asset held for investment is considered impaired  a loss is provided to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its fair value  less selling costs 
any future impairment could have a material adverse affect on the company s results of operations and funds from operations in the period in which the charge is taken

table of contents the company s shareholders may not be able to effect a change in control 
the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the company and the partnership agreement of the operating partnership contain a number of provisions that could delay  defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the company s shareholders or otherwise be in their best interests  including the following preferred shares 
the company s articles of incorporation provide that the company has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock  of which  were outstanding as of december  the board of directors has the authority  without the approval of the shareholders  to issue additional shares of preferred stock and to establish the preferences and rights of such shares 
the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of the company  even if a change of control were in the shareholders interest 
consent rights of the unitholders 
under the partnership agreement of the operating partnership  the company may not merge or consolidate with another entity unless the merger includes the merger of the operating partnership  which requires the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding units of the operating partnership 
if the company were to ever hold less than a majority of the units  this voting requirement might limit the possibility for an acquisition or a change of control 
ownership limit 
one of the requirements for maintenance of the company s qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes is that no more than in value of its outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals  including entities specified in the internal revenue code  during the last half of any taxable year 
to facilitate maintenance of its qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes  the ownership limit under the company s articles of incorporation prohibits ownership  directly or by virtue of the attribution provisions of the internal revenue code  by any person or persons acting as a group of more than of the issued and outstanding shares of the company s common stock  subject to certain exceptions  including an exception for shares of common stock held by mr 
john a 
williams and mr 
john t 
glover  the company s former chairman and former vice chairman and certain investors for which the company has waived the ownership limit 
together  these limitations are referred to as the ownership limit 
further  the company s articles of incorporation include provisions allowing it to stop transfers of and redeem its shares that are intended to assist the company in complying with these requirements 
while the company has committed that it will not utilize the ownership limit in its articles of incorporation as an anti takeover device  these provisions could still deter  delay or defer someone from taking control of the company 
terrorist attacks and the possibility of wider armed conflict may have an adverse effect on the company s business and operating results and could decrease the value of the company s assets 
terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
attacks or armed conflicts that directly impact one or more of the company s apartment communities could significantly affect the company s ability to operate those communities and thereby impair its ability to achieve the company s expected results 
further  the company s insurance coverage may not cover any losses caused by a terrorist attack 
in addition  the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the us economy could similarly have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
finally  if the united states enters into and remains engaged in a wider armed conflict  the company s business and operating results could be adversely effected

the company  through its wholly owned subsidiaries is the general partner and owns a majority interest in the operating partnership which  through its subsidiaries  conducts substantially all of the on going operations of the company 
at december   the company owned  apartment units in apartment communities  including apartment units in two communities held in unconsolidated entities and  apartment units in four communities and the expansion of one community currently under construction and or in lease up 
the company is also developing for sale condominium homes and is converting apartment homes in four communities initially consisting of units including units in one community held in an unconsolidated entity into for sale condominium homes through a taxable reit subsidiary 
at december   approximately   and on a unit basis of the company s operating communities were located in the atlanta  dallas  the greater washington dc and tampa metropolitan areas  respectively 
the company has elected to qualify and operate as a self administrated and self managed real estate investment trust reit for federal income tax purposes 
a reit is a legal entity which holds real estate interests and is generally not subject to federal income tax on the income it distributes to its shareholders 
at december   the company owned approximately of the common limited partnership interests common units in the operating partnership 
common units held by persons other than the company represented a common minority interest in the operating partnership 
in the four year period prior to  the multifamily apartment sector was adversely impacted by the supply of multifamily apartments outpacing demand  due primarily to the availability of capital and the low interest rate environment  demand for multifamily apartments that was adversely impacted by weakness in the overall us economy and the job market  as well as increased rates of homeownership due primarily to historically low mortgage interest rates 
in particular  the sunbelt markets in which a substantial portion of the company s apartment communities are located were adversely impacted 
beginning in  the company s operating results benefited from improved fundamentals in the multifamily apartment market  due primarily to improved job growth and overall growth in the us economy and job market  increasing mortgage interest rates and single family housing prices which have decreased the affordability of housing  as well as moderation in the supply of new market rate apartments in the primary markets and submarkets where the company operates 
the rate of improvement in multifamily market fundamentals continued to accelerate in  as interest rates continued to increase through the first half of the year  the for sale housing markets began to weaken as a result of higher interest rates and excess inventories  and the us economic and overall job growth climate and outlook continued to be favorable throughout the year 
this is evidenced by stronger year over year increases in same store operating revenues and property net operating income noi of and  respectively  in compared to and  respectively  in the company expects that these factors will continue to favorably impact apartment market fundamentals in the company is forecasting continued growth in same store community revenues and noi at rates similar to as more fully discussed in the outlook section below 
the company has also been active over the past several years repositioning its real estate portfolio and building its development and value creation capabilities centered upon its southeast  southwest and mid atlantic regions 
during this time  the company has been a net seller of apartment assets in an effort to exploit opportunities to harvest value and recycle capital through the sale of non core assets that no longer met the company s growth objectives 
the company s asset sales program has been consistent with its strategy of reducing its concentration in atlanta  georgia and dallas  texas  building critical mass in fewer markets and leveraging the post brand in order to improve operating efficiencies 
the company has redeployed capital raised from its asset sales to strengthen its balance sheet  by reducing high coupon preferred equity and debt  and reinvesting in assets that the company believes demonstrate better growth potential 
in this regard  the company disposed of   and  apartment units in  and  respectively  for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately   and  in  and  respectively 
during this same period  the company acquired  and apartment units for aggregate gross purchase prices of approximately   and  in  and  respectively

as a result  the company launched a new for sale brand  post preferred homes tm  which serves as the unified marketing umbrella for the company s for sale ventures  including developing new communities and converting existing apartment communities into upscale for sale housing in several key markets 
in  the company  through a taxable reit subsidiary  commenced the conversion of three existing apartment communities consisting of a total of units into for sale condominium homes  including one in an unconsolidated entity  located in atlanta  georgia  dallas  texas and tampa  florida 
one of these communities  containing units  located in tampa  florida  was completely sold out in the other two communities were substantially sold out by the end of during  the company  through a taxable reit subsidiary  also commenced the conversion of a portion of two additional existing apartment communities consisting of a total of units into for sale condominium homes  located in houston  texas and tampa  florida 
these two communities began closing condominium sales in the second quarter of recently  there has been a softening in the condominium and single family housing markets due to increasing mortgage financing rates  increasing supplies of such assets and a perceived slow down in the residential housing market and overall economic activity in the us as a result  the pace of condominium closings slowed in the second half of it is likely that condominium closings will continue to be slow at these communities into there can be no assurance of the amount or pace of future for sale condominium sales and closings 
in  the company expects to begin closing condominium contracts at its two newly developed for sale condominium projects  containing homes 
as of february   the company had in excess of condominium homes under contract at these communities 
these homes are expected to begin closing in the second quarter of there can be no assurances that condominium homes under contract at these communities will close 
the company s expansion into for sale condominium housing exposes the company to new risks and challenges  which if they materialize  could have an adverse impact on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
as of december   the company had approximately  of total estimated capital cost based on book value and including the company s investment in unconsolidated entities committed to its for sale condominium conversion and ground up development projects  including projected development costs expected to be funded relating to two for sale projects currently under construction 
in addition  the company also had  in the aggregate  approximately  of land held for future development and net investments in unconsolidated land entities as of december   of which a portion may be used to develop future for sale condominium projects depending upon market conditions 
there can be no assurance  however  that land held for future development will be used for such purposes or whether developments will actually commence

critical accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements in the preparation of financial statements and in the determination of company operating performance  the company utilizes certain significant accounting polices and these accounting policies are discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
also discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  there are new accounting pronouncements issued in and that may have an impact on future reported results 
the potential impact of certain new pronouncements on the company is discussed below and in the consolidated financial statements 
as the company is in the business of developing  owning and managing apartment communities and developing  converting and selling for sale condominiums  its critical accounting policies  ones that are subject to significant management estimates and judgments  relate to cost capitalization  asset impairment evaluation and revenue and profit recognition of for sale condominium activities 
for communities under development or rehabilitation  the company capitalizes interest  real estate taxes  and certain internal personnel and associated costs directly related to apartment communities under development and construction 
interest capitalized to projects under development or construction can fluctuate significantly from year to year based on the level of projects under development or construction and to a lesser extent  changes in the weighted average interest rate used in the calculation 
for the years ended december   and  the company capitalized interest totaling post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp 
table of contents   and  respectively 
the increase in primarily relates to a significantly increased development pipeline as the company recommenced development activities over the last few years with four new construction starts in and with several additional projects in development 
the weighted average interest rates used in the calculation of the capitalized interest amounts ranged from in to in and  as a result  were not the primary driver of the changes in interest capitalization discussed above 
in future periods  the company anticipates an increase in development activity in three regional markets which will result in increased interest capitalization over levels 
aggregate interest capitalization is expected to increase in even as the average interest rate used in the calculation is expected to be substantially the same as in due to the predominately fixed rate nature of the company s debt  future increases or decreases in short term interest rates are not expected to have a significant impact on the weighted average interest rate used for interest capitalization purposes 
future increases in short term and long term interest rates over time would cause an increase in the weighted average rate used for capitalization and cause interest amounts capitalized to increase 
internal personnel and associated costs are capitalized to the projects under development or construction based upon the effort associated with such projects 
in  the company expensed  of development personnel and associated costs 
in and  the company increased its development personnel in three regional geographic areas in anticipation of increased development activity in and in future periods 
in and  the company expensed  and  respectively  of development personnel and associated costs 
if future development volume increases over levels  a significant portion of such costs may be capitalized to development projects 
the company continually evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of its real estate assets using the methodology summarized in its accounting policies see note to the consolidated financial statements 
under current accounting literature  the evaluation of the recoverability of the company s real estate assets requires the judgment of company management in the determination of the value of the future cash flows expected from the assets and the estimated holding period for the assets 
the company uses market capitalization rates to determine the estimated residual value of its real estate assets and  generally  takes a long term view of the holding period of its assets unless specific facts and circumstances warrant shorter holding periods expected sales  departures from certain geographic markets  etc at december  and  management believed it had applied reasonable estimates and judgments in determining the proper classification of its real estate assets 
the company believes the actual results of prior year dispositions have validated the company s methodology discussed herein 
should external or internal circumstances change requiring the need to shorten the holding periods or adjust the estimated future cash flows of certain of the company s assets  the company could be required to record future impairment charges 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company recorded impairment losses in on assets held for sale or for investment under the application of its policies 
in  the company entered into the for sale condominium business 
at december   the company is selling condominiums at several condominium conversion communities and at two newly developed communities 
under sfas no 
 the company recognizes revenue and the resulting profit from condominium sales based on the relevant facts and circumstances associated with each condominium project 
for condominium conversion projects  revenues are recognized upon the closing of each sale transaction the completed contract method  as all conditions for full profit recognition are generally met at the time and the conversion construction periods are typically very short 
in and  all condominium sales were at condominium conversion projects 
under sfas no 
 the company uses the relative sales value method to allocate costs and recognize profits from condominium conversion sales 
under the relative sales value method  estimates of aggregate project revenues and aggregate project costs are used to determine the allocation of project cost of sales and the resulting profit in each accounting period 
in subsequent periods  project cost of sale allocations and profits are adjusted to reflect changes in the actual and estimated costs and estimated revenues of each project 
unexpected increases or decreases in estimated project revenues and project costs could cause future cost of sale and profit margin amounts recognized in the financial statements to be different than the amounts recognized in prior periods 
as the company continues to be active in the condominium business in future periods  changes in estimates of this nature could have a significant impact on reported future results from operations 
for newly developed condominiums  the company will evaluate the factors specified in sfas no 
to determine the appropriate method of accounting for each project either the percentage of completion method or the completed contract method 
the factors used to determine the appropriate method are a determination of whether the purchaser is legally committed to closing in the real estate contract  the construction of the project is beyond a preliminary phase  sufficient units have been contracted to ensure the project will not revert to a rental project  the aggregate project sale proceeds and costs can be reasonably estimated  and the buyer has made an adequate initial and continuing cash investment under the contract in accordance with sfas no 
under the percentage of completion method  revenues post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp 
table of contents and the associated profit would be recognized over the project construction period based on the ratio of total project costs incurred to estimated total project costs 
the determination of the profit margins to be reported also requires an estimate of the estimated aggregate revenues to be generated from condominium sales 
increases in estimated revenues and decreases in estimated costs over time would lead to increased profit recognition in future periods 
likewise  decreases in estimated revenues and increases in estimated costs over time would lead to reductions in profit margins in future periods 
additionally  contracts terminated prior to closing under the percentage of completion method would result in the reversal of previously recognized profits and such amounts could be material under market conditions that may lead to a general market value decline for condominiums 
at december   the company had two new condominium projects under development with approximately of the condominium homes under contract 
as the initial and continuing cash investments received do not meet the requirements of sfas no 
 as well as other factors  the company has concluded that these sales and profits at these projects will be accounted for under the completed contract method  similar to the accounting for condominium conversion projects discussed above 
in november the financial accounting standards board fasb ratified eitf issue no 
eitf no 
 applicability of the assessment of a buyer s continuing investment under fasb statement no 
for sales of condominiums 
eitf no 
provides additional guidance on whether the seller of a condominium unit is required to evaluate the buyer s continuing investment under sfas no 
in order to recognize profit from the sale under the percentage of completion method 
the eitf concluded that both the buyer s initial and continuing investment must meet the criteria in sfas no 
in order for condominium sale profits to be recognized under the percentage of completion method 
sales of condominiums not meeting the continuing investment test must be accounted for under the deposit method a method consistent with the company s above stated completed contract method 
eitf no 
is effective january  as discussed above  the company accounts for condominium sales using similar criteria to those stated in eitf no 
as a result  the company does not expect the adoption of eitf no

the emerging issues task force issued eitf no 
eitf no 
 determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights 
eitf no 
provides a framework for evaluating whether a general partner or group of general partners or managing members controls a limited partnership or limited liability company and therefore should consolidate the entity 
the presumption that the general partner or group of general partners or managing members controls a limited partnership or limited liability company may be overcome if the limited partners or members have the substantive ability to dissolve the partnership without cause  or substantive participating rights 
eitf no

fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement  was issued in july fin clarifies guidance on the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions and establishes a more likely than not standard for the evaluation of whether such tax positions can be recognized in the company s financial statements 
previously recognized tax positions that do not meet the more likely than not criteria will be required to be adjusted on the implementation date 
fin is effective for the company on january  additionally  fin requires additional disclosure regarding the nature and amount of uncertain tax positions  if any 
the company has performed an analysis and does not expect that the adoption of fin will have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations

sfas no 
clarified the definition of fair value in an effort to eliminate inconsistencies in the application of fair value under generally accepted accounting principles 
additional disclosure focusing on the methods used to determine fair value are also required 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and should be applied prospectively 
the company does not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
the securities and exchange commission issued sab no 
sab  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  in september sab requires that companies analyze the effect of financial statement misstatements on both their balance sheet and their income statement and contains guidance on correcting errors under this approach 
the company applied the guidance in sab on december  and  in accordance with the initial application provisions of sab  adjusted retained post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp 
table of contents earnings as of january  the adjustment was considered to be immaterial individually and in the aggregate in prior years based on the company s historical method of determining materiality 
the application of sab resulted in a cumulative effect adjustment to record the prior period impact of accounting for two ground leases with scheduled rent increases on a straight line basis during periods prior to january   and resulted in an increase in consolidated real estate assets of approximately  an increase in consolidated liabilities of approximately  and a decrease in consolidated equity of approximately   net of minority interest 
results of operations the following discussion of results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated statements of operations  the accompanying selected financial data and the community operations segment performance information included below 
the company s revenues and earnings from continuing operations are generated primarily from the operation of its apartment communities 
for purposes of evaluating comparative operating performance  the company categorizes its operating apartment communities based on the period each community reaches stabilized occupancy 
the company generally considers a community to have achieved stabilized occupancy on the earlier to occur of attainment of physical occupancy on the first day of any month or one year after completion of construction 
for the year ended december   the company s portfolio of operating apartment communities  excluding two communities held in unconsolidated entities  consisted of the following communities that were completed and stabilized for all of the current and prior year  portions of two communities that are being converted into condominiums that are reflected in continuing operations under sfas no 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  four operating communities that were acquired in and  and four communities in development  rehabilitation and lease up 
these operating segments exclude the operations of apartment communities classified as discontinued operations  condominium conversion communities classified as discontinued operations and apartment communities held in unconsolidated entities for the years presented 
the company has adopted an accounting policy related to communities in the lease up stage whereby substantially all operating expenses including pre opening marketing and management and leasing personnel expenses are expensed as incurred 
during the lease up phase  the sum of interest expense on completed units and other operating expenses including pre opening marketing and management and leasing personnel expenses will initially exceed rental revenues  resulting in a lease up deficit  which continues until such time as rental revenues exceed such expenses 
the lease up deficit for the year ended december  was approximately there were no lease up deficits in and  as no communities were in the lease up stage 
in order to evaluate the operating performance of its communities for the comparative years listed below  the company has presented financial information which summarizes the rental and other revenues  property operating and maintenance expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and net operating income on a comparative basis for all of its operating communities and for its stabilized operating communities 
net operating income is a supplemental non gaap financial measure 
the company believes that the line on the company s consolidated statement of operations entitled net income is the most directly comparable gaap measure to net operating income 
net operating income is reconciled to gaap net income in the financial information accompanying the tables 
the company believes that net operating income is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for a reit s operating real estate because it provides a measure of the core operations  rather than factoring in depreciation and amortization  financing costs and general and administrative expenses 
this measure is particularly useful  in the opinion of the company  in evaluating the performance of geographic operations  operating segment groupings and individual properties 
additionally  the company believes that net operating income  as defined  is a widely accepted measure of comparative operating performance in the real estate investment community

the decline in net income in  compared to  primarily reflected reduced gains on operating community sales of approximately  and reduced gains on condominium sales of  offset somewhat by the improved performance of the company s fully stabilized communities and increased interest capitalization due to a growing development pipeline 
these items are discussed in more detail in the sections below

the company plans to continue to be a seller of communities in depending upon market conditions and consistent with its investment strategy of recycling investment capital to fund new development and acquisition activities in its core markets 
see also the outlook section below for a discussion of condominium profit expectations in depreciation expense decreased  or from to primarily due to reduced depreciation resulting from certain furniture and fixtures with a five year life at certain properties becoming fully depreciated in and the cessation of depreciation expense in late on portions of two communities being converted into condominiums that continue to be reported in continuing operations under sfas no 
these decreases in depreciation expense between periods were offset by increased depreciation in on communities acquired in june  march and july interest expense included in continuing operations decreased  or from to the decreased expense amounts between periods reflects the impact of increased interest capitalization on its development projects of  between years  offset by higher interest costs on higher debt levels due to apartment community acquisitions and land acquisitions in and the first half interest expense included in discontinued operations decreased from  in to  in primarily due to interest expense associated with six communities sold in and one community sold in the third quarter of general and administrative expenses increased  or  from to primarily due to higher compensation costs offset by reduced legal  professional fees and the cumulative effect of the adoption of sfas r for recognizing stock based compensation 
higher compensation costs of approximately reflected annual compensation increases  increased personnel costs associated with internalizing compliance activities and annual incentive awards to management 
legal fees decreased by approximately due to a legal expense recovery of approximately related to prior year shareholder litigation 
professional fees decreased approximately in primarily due to savings in annual audit and sarbanes oxley compliance costs as the company internalized more of such efforts in in the first quarter of  the company implemented sfas r 
as the company had recorded stock based compensation expense under sfas since using the actual forfeiture method for early terminations of awards  the implementation of sfas using the estimated forfeiture method required by sfas r resulted in a one time reduction of general and administrative expenses of approximately in the first quarter of the aggregate one time reduction of expenses resulting from the adoption of sfas r totaled  with recorded as reductions of investment and development expenses and property operating expenses 
the one time effect of implementing sfas r will not recur in future periods 
investment  development and other expenses increased  or from to primarily due to the continued increase in development personnel and other costs to establish and grow the company s development capabilities in three regional markets in and and the write off of approximately of pursuit costs related to abandoned investment activities 
increased gross costs were somewhat offset by of increased capitalization of development personnel to an increasing development pipeline in equity in income of unconsolidated real estate entities increased or from to equity in income increased approximately due to the improved operating performance of the two stabilized communities held in two entities offset by reduced net gains from condominium sales and reduced net operating income in at the unconsolidated entity that was converting its apartment community into condominiums in and the reduced net operating income reflects the reduction in rental units throughout the conversion process and the reduced net gains from condominium sales reflects reduced sale prices and margins in in order to maintain a modest sales pace 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the operating results of the company s unconsolidated entities 
annually recurring and periodically recurring capital expenditures from continuing operations increased  or from to the increase in annually recurring capital expenditures of  primarily reflects the impact of several properties beginning to capitalize the replacement of carpet  vinyl and blinds in mid and into under the company s accounting policies during the first five years of a community  the company expenses the replacements of these items as well as leasing office upgrades at several communities in the increase in periodically recurring capital expenditures of  primarily reflects increased tenant improvements at the company s office and retail properties as well as the timing of large structural expenditures between periods

average monthly rental rate is defined as the average of the gross actual rental rates for leased units and the average of the anticipated rental rates for unoccupied units  divided by total units 
rental and other property revenues increased  or from to this increase resulted primarily from a increase in the average monthly rental rate per apartment unit as the average economic occupancy of the portfolio was consistent between years at 
this increase in average rental rates resulted in a revenue increase of approximately  between years 
this increase in revenue related to rental rates was offset somewhat by increased vacancy losses of primarily due to vacancy losses being measured at higher rental rates in additionally  other property revenues increased  as a result of higher up front leasing fees and higher utility reimbursements from residents due to increased utility expenses  lower net concessions of due to the favorable impact of straight lining net rentals due to generally reduced concessions in a stronger rental market in overall  the improving performance of the operating portfolio reflects improved market conditions strong job growth in most of the company s markets  a strong and steady us economy and a weakening for sale housing market due to higher interest rates and excess inventories in some markets  with the company s operations in all of its markets reporting increased revenues in excess of 
in addition in  the company completed the installation of automated revenue pricing software at the majority of its operating communities 
the company believes this automated pricing software implementation partially contributed to the increased revenues in with continuing strong market fundamentals in place  with the automated pricing software in place at year end and with anticipated stable occupancy rates expected in  the company s strategy will continue to be focused on increasing average rental rates in see the outlook section below for an additional discussion of trends for property operating and maintenance expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization increased  or from to this increase was primarily due to increased property tax expenses of  or  increased utility expenses of or  increased personnel expenses of or  increased other property expenses of or  increased insurance expenses of or offset by decreased advertising and promotion expenses of or 
property tax expenses increased due to increased property valuations in and more favorable tax settlements recorded in utility expenses increased primarily due to generally higher electric and gas rates 
personnel costs increased primarily due to annual salary increases 
other property expenses increased primarily due to costs associated with the automated revenue pricing software and use of third party call centers that were phased into the portfolio generally in the second half of insurance expenses increased due to an approximate increase in property insurance rates on renewal in the fourth quarter of primarily related to market increases in catastrophic coverage in coastal regions 
the decrease in advertising and promotions expense in primarily reflects reduced payments to apartment locator services resulting from more favorable market conditions and lower resident turnover between periods 
see the outlook section below for an additional discussion of trends in comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  for the purposes of comparative operating performance  the company categorizes its operating communities based on the period each community reaches stabilized occupancy  as defined above 
for the to comparison  the operating community categories were based on the status of each community as of december  as a result  these categories are different from the operating community categories used in the to comparison discussed earlier in this section

the company also realized a net of minority interest loss in connection with the termination of related interest rate cap agreements that were used as cash flow hedges of the assumed debt 
outlook for the company s outlook for is based on the expectation that apartment market fundamentals will continue to be favorable throughout the year as a result of favorable demand stemming from ongoing job growth and continued strength in the overall us economy  generally higher mortgage interest rates and single family housing prices which have decreased the affordability of housing  and the expectation of a relatively moderate level of supply of new market rate apartments in the primary markets and submarkets where the company operates

however  operating expenses of fully stabilized communities are also expected to increase in excess of in the company expects the primary drivers of this expense increase will be property taxes and insurance expenses

net condominium profits are expected to be higher in due primarily to the expected volume of condominium sales at the company s newly developed  the condominiums at carlyle square tm project in alexandria  va 
management expects interest expense in to be lower than in due generally to increased interest capitalization in resulting from increased project development volume as well as lower fixed interest rates on unsecured debt that was refinanced at a lower rate in management also expects increases in excess of in general and administrative  investment and development and property management expenses due in large part to increased costs of personnel and incentive compensation plans as well as increased technology expenses supporting the company s new technology platforms and initiatives

capitalization of fixed assets and community improvements the company has a policy of capitalizing those expenditures relating to the acquisition of new assets and the development and construction of new apartment communities 
in addition  the company capitalizes expenditures that enhance the value of existing assets and expenditures that substantially extend the life of existing assets 
all other expenditures necessary to maintain a community in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred 
additionally  for new development communities  carpet  vinyl and blind replacements are expensed as incurred during the first five years which corresponds to the estimated depreciable life of these assets after construction completion 
thereafter  these replacements are capitalized

the company treats each unit in an apartment community separately for cost accumulation  capitalization and expense recognition purposes 
prior to the commencement of leasing activities  interest and other construction costs are capitalized and included in construction in progress 
the company ceases the capitalization of such costs as the residential units in a community become substantially complete and available for occupancy

total estimated construction costs for the post hyde park expansion include the estimated replacement costs of six apartment units at the company s existing hyde park community that are being demolished to accommodate the expansion 
inflation for each of the last three years and as of december   substantially all of the leases at the communities allow  at the time of renewal  for adjustments in the rent payable thereunder  and thus may enable the company to seek increases in rents 
the substantial majority of these leases are for one year or less and the remaining leases are for up to two years 
at the expiration of a lease term  the company s lease agreements generally provide that the term will be extended unless either the company or the lessee gives at least sixty days written notice of termination 
in addition  the company s policy generally permits the earlier termination of a lease by a lessee upon thirty days written notice to the company and the payment of an amount equal to two month s rent as compensation for early termination 
the short term nature of these leases generally serves to offset the risk to the company that the adverse effect of inflation may have on the company s general  administrative and operating expenses 
funds from operations the company uses the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition of funds from operations ffo 
ffo is defined by nareit as net income available to common shareholders determined in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from extraordinary items and sales of depreciable property  plus depreciation of real estate assets  and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with gaap 
ffo is a supplemental non gaap financial measure 
ffo presented herein is not necessarily comparable to ffo presented by other real estate companies because not all real estate companies use the same definition 
the company s ffo is comparable to the ffo of real estate companies that use the current nareit definition 
the company also uses ffo as an operating measure 
accounting for real estate assets using historical cost accounting under gaap assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
nareit stated in its april white paper on funds from operations since real estate asset values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
as a result  the concept of ffo was created by nareit for the reit industry to provide an alternate measure 
since the company agrees with the concept of ffo and appreciates the reasons surrounding its creation  management believes that ffo is an important supplemental measure of operating performance 
in addition  since most equity reits provide ffo information to the investment community  the company believes ffo is a useful supplemental measure for comparing the company s results to those of other equity reits 
the post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp 
table of contents company believes that the line on the company s consolidated statement of operations entitled net income available to common shareholders is the most directly comparable gaap measure to ffo 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income available to common shareholders determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of the company s financial performance 
while management believes that ffo is an important supplemental non gaap financial measure  management believes it is also important to stress that ffo should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity
