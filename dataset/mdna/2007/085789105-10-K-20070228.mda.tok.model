item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview 
our mission is to increase shareholder value through consistent growth in our production and reserves  both through the drill bit and acquisitions 
we strive to operate our properties in an efficient manner to maximize the cash flow and earnings of our assets 
the strategies to accomplish these goals include developing our existing resource base acquiring additional assets with significant growth potential utilizing joint ventures with respected partners to enter new basins accumulating significant acreage positions near our producing operations investing our capital in a disciplined manner and maintaining a strong financial position notable items in achieved record production which averaged  boe d  up from achieved record cash from operating activities of million  up from achieved net income of million  down from added million boe of proved reserves before production ending at million boe achieved reserve replacement rate of expended million of capital expenditures  including million of developmental capital expenditures acquired operatorship and working interest in  gross acres of natural gas assets in the garden gulch property in the grand valley field in the piceance basin  colorado  at an acquisition cost of million entered into an agreement to jointly develop natural gas properties in the north parachute ranch property in the grand valley field in the piceance basin  colorado  to earn a working interest in  gross acres near our garden gulch assets announced development of our diatomite asset heavy oil with a well drilling program scheduled for in the midway sunset field  california discovered light oil accumulations in the green river and wasatch formations at lake canyon  uinta basin  utah added financial capacity by increasing our senior unsecured revolving credit facility to million with an initial borrowing base of million issued million of ten year senior subordinated notes in october completed two for one split of class a common stock and class b stock increased our regular quarterly dividend by to

the refinery resumed operations in mid january our price differential for our black wax crude oil in the uinta basin widened causing lower realizations and negatively impacted our earnings for the quarter 
improving the demand for this crude has been a major challenge 
this situation  and generally weaker oil and gas prices  lowered our realized prices by compared to the third quarter of view to our challenge for is to manage our business in a rapidly changing price and operating environment while adding significant reserves through the drill bit 
we have an extensive inventory of development drilling in several basins  and expect our program to be the most influenced by production and reserve growth in the piceance basin 
we intend our capital program  excluding acquisitions  to closely reflect our cash flow from operations 
additional funds may be provided by the divestiture of several non strategic assets  including our montalvo properties  bakken acreage and others 
we have six asset teams  three in california and three in the rocky mountain mid continent region  and each team has specific targets on production  reserve growth  capital expenditures and operating costs 
we believe managing our assets in this manner will maximize operational efficiencies and add the most value to our shareholders 
we will manage our balance sheet prudently  and while we are focused on the continuing development of our existing assets  we will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities that fit our growth strategy 
view to the first quarter of crude oil prices wti were volatile in the first quarter ranging from per barrel wti to per barrel and we expect oil and gas prices to remain volatile in on february  we entered into a long term six year crude oil sales contract for our uinta basin production 
this contract will allow us to improve our margins on these barrels beginning on july  and provides us assurance of deliverability and return on our investment 
we are accelerating our investment in our poso creek  california properties due to its excellent response to our development activity 
our total net production volumes in the first quarter are expected to average between  and  boe d 
piceance basin our new core area 
in  we made two separate significant investments in the gas rich piceance basin in colorado  targeting the williams fork section of the mesaverde formation 
we spent million balance of million due in to acquire a high working interest in several prime blocks of acreage located in the grand valley field 
most of the acreage was undeveloped and we added only mmboe in proved reserves from these acquisitions 
we believe we have accumulated a very sizable resource base which will allow us to add significant proved reserves over the next five years 
we believe we have over  drilling locations on this acreage 
we are anticipating initial gross production ranging from to mmcf per well with the ultimate risked gross recovery of approximately bcf per well 
well costs are expected to be in the million to million range per well and we are targeting average depths of between  feet to  feet 
we anticipate running four rigs in to develop this asset 
capital expenditures 
our capital expenditures for totaled million consisting of million for acquisitions  million for exploration and development  million for drilling rigs and other assets and million of capitalized interest 
we funded these items from million of operating cash flow and million from additional borrowings 
this compares to our total capital expenditures in of million  which consisted of million of acquisitions  million in exploration and development and million in drilling rigs and other assets 
excluding the acquisition price of new properties  in we have a developmental capital program of approximately million and we will make a final payment of million associated with our piceance joint venture 
we are proceeding with this program  but may revise our plans due to lower commodity price expectations  to the timing of crude deliveries out of the uinta basin  to equipment availability  to permitting or other factors 
our capital program allows us to continue high activity levels and as a result  we are targeting production to average between  boe d to  boe d 
in  we expect production to be approximately heavy oil  light oil and natural gas and anticipate funding our development capital program primarily from internally generated cash flow 
we have currently secured the necessary equipment and are meeting permit requirements to achieve the program 
development  exploitation and exploration activity 
we drilled gross net wells during  realizing a gross success rate of percent 
excluding any future acquisitions  our targeted developmental capital budget is million 
as of december   we have four rigs drilling on our properties under long term contracts and have several more rigs scheduled to begin in early drilling activity

generally  our california assets are mature diatomite and poso creek are the exception and generate more cash flow from operations than is required to reinvest in these assets 
we have high capital needs in the piceance  uinta and the dj basins  where we have large undeveloped resources 
we anticipate spending most of our operating cash flow over the next several years in converting the recoverable hydrocarbons to production  cash flow and earnings 
california california s three asset teams are south midway sunset smwss  north midway sunset nmwss which includes diatomite and southern california socal which include poso creek  ethel d  placerita and montalvo 
approximately million will be invested in california projects in with million  million and million allocated for the smwss  nmwss and socal assets  respectively 
smwss  san joaquin valley basin sjvb we own and operate working interests in properties  including owned in fee  in the midway sunset field 
production from this field relies on thermal eor methods  primarily cyclic steaming 
development activities were focused on horizontal drilling 
capital is focused on further horizontal infill well drilling  targeting steam injection wells and improved subsurface well monitoring 
production averaged approximately  bbl d in this is our most mature thermally enhanced asset and we are developing and testing new concepts to place heat into the remaining oil column to maximize recovery and value 
we are also improving our steam monitoring capabilities to verify efficient steam placement 
nmwss  sjvb on november   we announced our plans to commence development of our midway sunset diatomite oil project in california based on the performance of a two year pilot program 
we believe the project will be a significant asset for our california operations and for berry 
the project will add material production and reserves as a part of our growth strategy 
over the next four years  we intend to invest an additional million in capital to drill shallow development wells in the fairway of the asset and add steam generation and processing facilities 
we expect this development will increase production by up to  bbl d by in the project averaged bbl d 
as we develop the fairway  we will also appraise the potential of recovering additional reserves in the outer portions of our acreage in subsequent development phases 
we believe that the fairway contains of the oil resource and has reservoir properties similar to our initial pilot 
this will enable a repeatable development like those used in our other california assets 
completed commercial testing 
capital is focused on drilling the diatomite first phase development wells and adding steam generation equipment and various facilities 
we will also be initiating steam drive pilots in one of our largest remaining hydrocarbon resources in the tulare sands on our main camp property in the midway sunset field 
during we redeveloped our pan property on the non diatomite section of nmwss by drilling over infill locations and adding steam generation capacity and associated production facilities 
production responded by increasing from approximately bbl d to a peak of over bbl d 
further infill drilling locations are currently being evaluated 
socal  sjvb and los angeles basin we acquired the poso creek properties in early and have proceeded with a successful thermal eor redevelopment 
at acquisition the property was producing less than boe d and we averaged bbl d in activity was directed at delineating the extent of the reservoir  infill drilling and expansion of the steam drive pilot 
production from this property increased as a result of thermal redevelopment steadily throughout the year from approximately bbl d to over  bbl d at december  additional steam generation capacity was added during the first half of the year along with infill delineation wells and late in the fourth quarter we began drilling additional infill wells 
capital is directed at drilling infill producer locations  adding additional steam generation capacity and expanding the steam drive area 
in the placerita field in the los angeles basin  we own and operate working interests in properties  including leases and fee properties 
production relies on thermal recovery methods  primarily steam flooding 
we reassessed our existing steam drive and discovered additional remaining reserves within the existing mature steam drive area 
several infill wells were drilled and confirmed our assessment 
further reservoir analysis simulation is in progress to determine the optimum recovery method 
capital is directed at steam flood modifications and facility improvements 
we will also be initiating steam drive pilots in the other largest remaining hydrocarbon resources in the monarch sands at ethel d property in the midway sunset field 
we are pursuing the divestment of our montalvo properties in ventura county  california and have no capital allocated to the asset  which produced over bbl d in rocky mountain mid continent we reorganized the structure of the rocky mountain mid continent region into three regional asset teams in late to strengthen our technical and business focus in the region 
the three asset teams are centered around the piceance basin mesaverde gas development  the uinta basin green river and wasatch oil exploitation and the dj basin niobrara gas projects 
approximately million will be invested in rocky mountain region projects in with million  million and million earmarked for the piceance  uinta and dj basins  respectively 
piceance basin  colorado in february  we acquired a working interest in  gross acres in the garden gulch property in the grand valley natural gas field in the piceance basin of western colorado for approximately million 
then in june  we entered into an agreement with an industry partner to jointly develop our commitment under the agreement is approximately million the north parachute ranch property in the grand valley field in the piceance immediately east of the garden gulch property 
in accordance with the agreement we acquired a non operating working interest on  gross acres and a net operating working interest of in  gross acres 
we have financial commitments under both the and the working interests 
see note to the financial statements 
this agreement for the north parachute ranch property expands upon our reserves and drilling opportunities with an additional locations 
production from these wells is expected to be similar to garden gulch wells  with initial gross production rates ranging from to mmcf d 
we drilled gross wells  on the garden gulch property and two on the north parachute ranch property 
our industry partner drilled gross wells upon which we earned non operating working interest 
our net production in averaged  mcf d 
we have contracts for four rigs as of december  to proceed with our development plan 
we have made significant progress in gearing up for extensive development of this asset  including additional outlets for gas sales 
the garden gulch acreage now has wells producing and initial production from the north parachute ranch property began late in the fourth quarter 
capital is directed at drilling to mesaverde wells along with associated land  facility and water disposal projects 
uinta basin  utah the brundage canyon leasehold in duchesne county  northeastern utah consists of federal  tribal and private leases 
we continued the development of the green river formation  including testing acre infill wells to assist full development  including a acre spacing pilot 
during the year infield gas gathering infrastructure was upgraded with additional compression and a gas processing facility to handle increasing volumes of natural gas 
in the fourth quarter of  an environmental assessment ea was completed in the ashley national forest  clearing the way for drillsites and up to wells 
we were able to drill and complete one well before winter access restrictions went into effect 
in  we drilled total net wells in brundage with success rate 
daily net production averaged approximately  boe d 
capital is directed at the ashley forest  additional acre infills and high graded locations across the field 
the majority of this development program is targeted for the second half of the year due to winter wildlife stipulations 
in the lake canyon prospect  we hold  with an industry partner  a  gross acre block which is located immediately west of our brundage canyon producing properties 
we will drill and operate the shallow wells which target light oil and natural gas in the green river formation and retain up to a working interest 
our partner will drill and operate deep wells which target hydrocarbons in the mesaverde and wasatch formations 
we will hold up to a working interest in these deep wells 
the ute tribe has the option to participate in each well and obtain a working interest which would reduce our and our partner s participation 
in january  we announced commercial success from our first two wells on this acreage  from the same green river formation that is productive immediately east approximately three miles in our brundage canyon field 
performance from these discovery wells suggests that expected reserves per well are on par with the brundage canyon field approximately  boe gross that is currently being developed on acre spacing 
production from these two shallow green river wells continues to be favorable 
we have a working interest in these two wells  as the ute tribe elected to participate 
in the third quarter  with tribal participation  we drilled four additional shallow green river wells that are all productive 
in the second quarter of  our industry partner initiated production from a deep well completed in the wasatch formation 
due to the success of this wasatch discovery well  our industry partner drilled two additional wasatch wells in the fourth quarter of these wells are currently waiting on completion 
we have an working interest in these two wells  as the ute tribe elected to participate in one of the two wells 
our daily net production from the lake canyon wells averaged approximately boe d 
we are in the permitting process for an additional shallow green river wells which are intended to continue exploratory and development drilling on the eastern portion of our lake canyon acreage 
our working interest in these wells will be either or depending on tribal participation 
our industry partner is also permitting additional deep wells for their drilling program 
our capital is directed at a methodical appraisal covering a sizeable portion of this acreage block  targeting green river and wasatch reservoirs 
in december  we entered into a development agreement with an industry partner to develop their coyote flats prospect 
the property is located approximately miles southwest of our brundage canyon property 
we have three successful appraisal ferron gas wells on the east side of the scofield reservoir which have each tested flow rates exceeding  mcf d 
we renegotiated the farm out obligation terms with our industry partner to earn a working interest in the approximate  gross  net acres in the project without drilling the remaining emery coalbed methane wells 
our earning obligation was satisfied by installing a gathering system  compression and mile gas pipeline to connect the three previously announced ferron gas discoveries to sales pipelines 
construction is complete and first sales were established in december two of the three wells are currently on production with the third being temporarily shut in pending a water disposal solution 
our daily net production is approximately mcf d 
no capital has been directed at this project  pending results from production tests on the three discovery wells 
dj basin includes eastern colorado producing assets in  we made three acquisitions for approximately million establishing a core area in the tri state region eastern colorado  western kansas and southwestern nebraska totaling approximately  net producing acres and  net total acres 
our primary acquisition was the niobrara gas producing assets in yuma county in northeastern colorado in which we have a working interest of approximately 
our other two acquisitions in the region consisted of undeveloped prospective acreage where our working interests range from to 
we drilled wells to add production from both proved undeveloped and probable reserves and five exploratory wells and our net production averaged  mcf d 
we participated in five d seismic surveys covering in excess of square miles 
in the third quarter  we installed additional compression  gas gathering pipelines and high pressure pipelines that expand the capacity and connections to new markets on the cheyenne plains lateral system 
in our kansas tri state prospect  we have drilled and completed a successful exploratory well that is an extension to our prairie star production in cheyenne county  kansas and have drilled two dry holes in the year 
capital is directed at development drilling for yuma county reserve growth  additional d seismic in colorado and kansas and additional exploration in kansas 
obstacles and risks to accomplishment of strategies and goals 
see item a risk factors for a detailed discussion of factors that affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations 
approximately of our revenues are generated through the sale of oil and natural gas production under either negotiated contracts or spot gas purchase contracts at market prices 
the remaining of our revenues are primarily derived from electricity sales from cogeneration facilities which supply approximately of our steam requirement for use in our california thermal heavy oil operations 
we have invested in these facilities for the purpose of lowering our steam costs which are significant in the production of heavy crude oil 
revenues 
sales of oil and gas were up in compared to and up from this significant improvement was due to increases in both oil and gas prices and production levels 
improvements in production volume are due to acquisitions and sizable capital investments 
improvement in prices during were due to a tighter supply and demand balance and the nervousness of the market about possible supply disruptions 
oil and natural gas prices contributed roughly half of the revenue increase and the increase in production volumes contributed the other half 
approximately of our oil and gas sales volumes in were crude oil  with of the crude oil being heavy oil produced in california which was sold under contracts based on the higher of wti minus a fixed differential or the average posted price plus a premium 
our oil contracts allowed us to improve our california revenues over the posted price by approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively

we consume natural gas as fuel to operate our three cogeneration facilities which are intended to provide an efficient and secure long term supply of steam necessary for the cost effective production of heavy oil 
we sell our electricity to utilities under standard offer contracts  which are based on avoided cost or srac pricing approved by the cpuc and under which our revenues are currently linked to the cost of natural gas 
natural gas index prices are the primary determinant of our electricity sales price based on the current pricing formula under these contracts 
the correlation between electricity sales and natural gas prices allows us to manage our cost of producing steam more effectively 
revenue and operating costs in the year ended were down from the year ended due to lower electricity prices and lower natural gas prices  respectively 
we purchased approximately mmbtu d as fuel for use in our cogeneration facilities in the year ended december  the following table is for the years ended december electricity revenues in millions operating costs in millions decrease to total oil and gas operating expenses per barrel electric power produced mwh d electric power sold mwh d average sales price mwh no hedging was in place fuel gas cost mmbtu after hedging and excluding transportation the following table is for the three months ended december  december  september  electricity revenues in millions operating costs in millions electric power produced mwh d electric power sold mwh d average sales price mwh fuel gas cost mmbtu excluding transportation royalties

this royalty is of the amount of the heavy oil posted price above a base price which was in this base price escalates at annually  thus the threshold price is per barrel in amounts paid were million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
accounts payable associated with this royalty at year end was million 
because our interest in the revenue varies according to crude prices  the continuing development on this property will depend on its future profitability

oil and gas operating  production taxes  g a and interest expenses 
we believe that the most informative way to analyze changes in recurring operating expenses from one period to another is on a per unit of production  or boe  basis 
the following table presents information about our operating expenses for each of the years ended december amount per boe amount in thousands change change operating costs oil and gas production production taxes dd a oil and gas production g a interest expense total our total operating costs  production taxes  g a and interest expenses for  stated on a unit of production basis  increased over the changes were primarily related to the following items operating costs operating costs in were higher than due to an increase in well servicing activities and higher cost of goods and services in general 
we installed additional steam generators in california related to various thermally enhanced oil projects and as a result of the increased steam injection  our crude oil production on these properties has continued to increase 
the cost of our steaming operations on our heavy oil properties in california varies depending on the cost of natural gas used as fuel and the volume of steam injected 
the following table presents steam information change average volume of steam injected bbl d fuel gas cost mmbtu as we remain in a strong commodity price environment  we anticipate that cost pressures within our industry may continue due to greater field activity and rising service costs in general 
based on current plans  we are targeting average steam injection in of approximately  to  bspd 
natural gas prices impact our cost structure in california by approximately per california boe for each change in natural gas price 
production taxes our production taxes have increased over the last year as the value of our oil and natural gas has increased 
severance taxes  which are prevalent in utah and colorado  are directly related to the cost of the field sales price of the commodity 
in california  our production is burdened with ad valorem taxes on our total proved reserves 
during our production taxes increased as a result of higher assessed values on our properties  increased production and higher investment in mineral interests 
we expect production taxes to track the commodity price generally 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a increased per boe in due to a large increase in capital spending over the last two years and particularly more extensive development in fields with higher drilling costs 
higher leasehold acquisition costs in through are expected to increase our dd a expense over the life of these assets as development increases 
our capital program is experiencing cost pressures in our labor and for goods and services commensurate with other energy developers 
as these costs increase  our dd a rates per boe will also increase 
general and administrative approximately two thirds of our g a is compensation or compensation related costs 
our employee headcount increased as we added an important new core asset into our portfolio and as we are strengthening our talent base 
we also re examined our compensation structure and made necessary changes to attract and retain the talent needed to achieve our growth goals 
we are experiencing higher employee turnover rates as the demand for experienced personnel in the energy industry is very high 
other items increasing our g a in were contributions to fund the opposition of proposition in california  increased travel and consulting costs and a generally higher level of activity 
interest expense our outstanding borrowings  including our senior unsecured money market line of credit and senior subordinated notes  was million at december  compared to million at december  average borrowings in increased as a result of our piceance basin acquisitions during and capital expenditure program 
a certain portion of our interest cost related to our piceance basin acquisition and joint venture has been capitalized into the basis of the assets  and we anticipate a portion will continue to be capitalized during and until our probable reserves have been recategorized to proved reserves 
for the year ended december   million has been capitalized and we expect to capitalize approximately million of interest cost during the full year of the following table presents information about our operating expenses for the three months ended amount per boe amount in thousands december  december  september  december  december  september  operating costs oil and gas production production taxes dd a oil and gas production g a interest expense total december  december  change september  change average volume of steam injected bbl d fuel gas cost mmbtu the following table presents information about our operating expenses for each of the years ended december amount per boe amount in thousands change change operating costs oil and gas production production taxes dd a oil and gas production g a interest expense total our total operating costs  production taxes  g a and interest expenses for  stated on a unit of production basis  increased over the changes were primarily related to the following items operating costs higher crude oil and natural gas prices have created an incentive for the us domestic oil and gas industry to significantly increase exploration and development activities  which is straining the capacity for goods and services that support our industry 
thus  higher costs are prominent throughout the industry and resulted in higher operating costs per boe for the year ended as compared to costs in california were also higher due to increased well servicing activities and increases in steam costs 
the cost of our steaming operations on our heavy oil properties represents a significant portion of our operating costs and will vary depending on the cost of natural gas used as fuel and the volume of steam injected 
the following table presents steam information change average volume of steam injected bbl d fuel gas cost mmbtu production taxes higher prices  such as those exhibited in  create increased production taxes 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a increased per boe in the year ended from the year ended due to higher acquisition costs of our rocky mountain mid continent region assets as compared to our legacy heavy oil assets in california and higher finding and development costs 
as these costs increase  our dd a rates per boe will also increase

we intend to remain competitive in workforce compensation to achieve our growth plans 
stock based compensation expense was

dry hole  abandonment and impairment 
reflected on our year ended income statement under the dry hole  abandonment and impairment line  there is million that consists primarily of two coyote flats  utah wells for million  our share in an exploration well located in the lake canyon project area of the uinta basin drilled for approximately million net to our interest and four wells in bakken and four wells in tri state for million 
for the year ended  costs of million which were incurred on one exploratory well on the coyote flats prospect  the midway sunset property  two exploratory wells at northern brundage canyon  and million of impairment on the remaining carrying value of our illinois and eastern kansas prospective cbm acreage were charged to expense 
during  we recorded costs of 
million on exploratory wells on the midway sunset property and the coyote flats prospect 
exploration costs 
we incurred exploration costs of million in compared to million and zero costs in and  respectively 
these costs consist primarily of geological and geophysical costs 
we participated in d seismic surveys at lake canyon  utah and in the tri state area 
we are projecting exploration costs in of between million and million 
income taxes 
the revenue reconciliation act of included a tax credit for certain costs associated with extracting high cost  capital intensive marginal oil or gas which utilizes certain methods  including cyclic steam and steam flood recovery methods for heavy oil 
historically  we have had significant investment in qualifying costs and have been able to reduce our effective tax rate considerably 
however  the federal and state eor tax credits were fully phased out in due to the average us wellhead crude oil price exceeding the allowable eor tax credit ceiling price of per barrel 
if the average us wellhead price of crude oil declines below the triggering point in future years  we expect to earn and claim the eor credit on qualifying expenditures and therefore our effective tax rate should decline 
as of december  we have approximately million of federal and million of state california eor tax credit carryforwards available to reduce future cash income taxes 
the eor credits will begin to expire  if unused  in and for federal and california  respectively 
we experienced an effective tax rate of  and in  and  respectively 
the significant increase in effective tax rate during is primarily due to the phase out of eor tax credits in in anticipation of the continued full eor credit phase out in  we expect our effective tax rate to be between to  based on wti prices averaging between and see note to the financial statements for further information 
commodity derivatives 
in the quarter ended march   we took a charge for the change in fair market value of our natural gas derivatives put in place to protect our piceance basin acquisition future cash flows 
these gas derivatives did not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas because the price index in the derivative instrument did not correlate closely with the item being hedged 
the pre tax charge in the first quarter was million which represented the change in fair market value over the life of the contract  which resulted from an increase in natural gas prices from the date of the derivative to march  on may   we entered into basis swaps with natural gas volumes to match the volumes on our nymex henry hub collars that were placed on march  the combination of the derivative instruments entered into on march  described above and the basis swaps were designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with sfas thus the unrealized net gain of million on the income statement in the second quarter of under the caption commodity derivatives is primarily the change in fair value of the derivative instrument caused by changes in forward price curves prior to designating these instruments as cash flow hedges 
post may  changes in the marked to market fair values are reflected in other comprehensive income 
asset dispositions 
we have significantly increased and strengthened our portfolio of assets since and expect to continue to make acquisitions 
we anticipate that we will dispose of certain properties or assets over time 
the assets most likely for disposition will be those that do not fit or complement our strategic growth plan  that are not contributing satisfactory economic returns given the profile of the assets  or we believe the development potential will not be meaningful to our company as a whole 
we have identified several assets that fit our criteria and expect to divest of these assets in proceeds from these sales will contribute to the funding of our capital program 
net oil and gas properties and equipment classified as held for sale is million for the year ended december  in accordance with sfas no 
see note to the financial statements 
reserve replacement rate 
the reserve replacement rate is calculated by dividing total new proved reserves added for the year by total production for the year 
total new proved reserves include  revision of previous estimate  improved recovery  extensions and discoveries  and purchase of reserves in place 
this measure is important because it is an indication of growth in proved reserves and  thus may impact our value 
we believe our calculation of this measure is substantially similar to how other companies compute reserve replacement rate 
see item supplemental information about oil gas producing activities unaudited 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources 
substantial capital is required to replace and grow reserves 
we achieve reserve replacement and growth primarily through successful development and exploration drilling and the acquisition of properties 
fluctuations in commodity prices have been the primary reason for short term changes in our cash flow from operating activities 
the net long term growth in our cash flow from operating activities is the result of growth in production as affected by period to period fluctuations in commodity prices 
in the second quarter of  we revised our senior unsecured revolving credit facility to increase our maximum credit amount under the facility to million and increased our current borrowing base to million 
on october   we completed the sale of million of ten year senior subordinated notes and paid down our borrowings under our facility by million 
as of december   we had total borrowings under the senior unsecured revolving credit facility and senior unsecured money market line of credit of million and million under our senior subordinated notes 
capital expenditures 
we establish a capital budget for each calendar year based on our development opportunities and the expected cash flow from operations for that year 
acquisitions are typically debt financed 
we may revise our capital budget during the year as a result of acquisitions and or drilling outcomes 
excess cash generated from operations is expected to be applied toward acquisitions  debt reduction or other corporate purposes 
in  we have a developmental capital program of approximately million  excluding acquisitions  plus we intend to make a final payment of million associated with our piceance joint venture 
we are proceeding with this program  but may revise our plans due to lower commodity price expectations  timing of crude deliveries out of the uinta basin  equipment availability  permitting or other factors 
our expenditures will be directed toward developing reserves  increasing oil and gas production and exploration opportunities 
for  we plan to invest approximately million  or  in our rocky mountain mid continent region assets  and million  or  in our california assets 
approximately half of the capital budget is focused on converting probable and possible reserves into proved reserves and on our appraisal and exploratory projects  while the other half is for the development of our proved reserves and facility costs 
dividends 
we paid a special dividend of 
per share on september  and increased our regular quarterly dividend by  from 
to 
per share beginning with the september dividend 
our regular annual dividend is currently 
per share  payable quarterly in march  june  september and december 
working capital and cash flows 
cash flow from operations is dependent upon the price of crude oil and natural gas and our ability to increase production and manage costs 
combined crude oil and natural gas prices increased in see graphs on page and we increased production by 
our working capital balance fluctuates as a result of the amount of borrowings and the timing of repayments under our credit arrangements 
we used our long term borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility primarily to fund property acquisitions 
generally  we use excess cash to pay down borrowings under our credit arrangement 
as a result  we often have a working capital deficit or a relatively small amount of positive working capital 
in  the working capital deficit was substantially greater than the increase in the deficit is primarily made up of the million property acquisition payable related to the final payment of the june piceance transaction as compared to the table below compares financial condition  liquidity and capital resources changes as of and for the years ended december in millions  except for production and average prices change average production boe d average oil and gas sales prices  per boe after hedging net cash provided by operating activities working capital sales of oil and gas long term debt capital expenditures  including acquisitions and deposits on acquisitions dividends paid does not include our commitment to drill wells on our lake canyon prospect pursuant to our joint venture or the remaining payment under our piceance basin joint venture

contractual obligations 
our contractual obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt and interest abandonment obligations operating lease obligations property acquisition payable drilling and rig obligations firm natural gas transportation contracts total long term debt and interest our credit facility borrowings and related interest of approximately can be paid before its maturity date without significant penalty on borrowings under our credit facility 
our bond notes and related interest of mature in november  but are not redeemable until november  and are not redeemable without any premium until november  operating leases we lease corporate and field offices in california  colorado and texas 
rent expense with respect to our lease commitments for the years ended december   and was million  
million  and 
million  respectively 
in  we purchased an airplane for business travel which was subsequently sold and contracted under a ten year operating lease beginning december drilling obligation we intend to participate in the drilling of over gross wells on our lake canyon prospect over the four year contract  beginning in our minimum obligation under our exploration and development agreement is million 
also included above  under our june joint venture agreement in the piceance basin we must have wells drilled by to avoid penalties of 
million per well or a maximum of million 
drilling rig obligation we are obligated in operating lease agreements for the use of multiple drilling rigs 
firm natural gas transportation we have one firm transportation contract which provides us additional flexibility in securing our natural gas supply for california operations 
this allows us to potentially benefit from lower natural gas prices in the rocky mountains compared to natural gas prices in california 
we also have several long term transportation contracts which provide us with physical access to interstate pipelines to move gas from our producing areas to markets 
application of critical accounting policies 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the reporting period and as of the financial statement date 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results could differ from those amounts 
a critical accounting policy is one that is important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and requires management to make difficult subjective and or complex judgments 
critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical policies 
successful efforts method of accounting 
we account for our oil and gas exploration and development costs using the successful efforts method 
geological and geophysical costs  and the costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties  are expensed as incurred 
exploratory well costs are capitalized pending further evaluation of whether economically recoverable reserves have been found 
if economically recoverable reserves are not found  exploratory well costs are expensed as dry holes 
all exploratory wells are evaluated for economic viability within one year of well completion 
exploratory wells that discover potentially economic reserves that are in areas where a major capital expenditure would be required before production could begin  and where the economic viability of that major capital expenditure depends upon the successful completion of further exploratory work in the area  remain capitalized as long as the additional exploratory work is under way or firmly planned 
oil and gas reserves 
oil and gas reserves include proved reserves that represent estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
our oil and gas reserves are based on estimates prepared by independent engineering consultants 
reserve engineering is a subjective process that requires judgment in the evaluation of all available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
projected future production rates  the timing of future capital expenditures as well as changes in commodity prices may significantly impact estimated reserve quantities 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense and impairment of proved properties are impacted by our estimation of proved reserves 
these estimates are subject to change as additional information and technologies become available 
accordingly  oil and natural gas quantities ultimately recovered and the timing of production may be substantially different than projected 
reduction in reserve estimates may result in increased dd a expense  increased impairment of proved properties and a lower standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows 
carrying value of long lived assets 
downward revisions in our estimated reserve quantities  increases in future cost estimates or depressed crude oil or natural gas prices could cause us to reduce the carrying amounts of our properties 
we perform an impairment analysis of our proved properties annually by comparing the future undiscounted net revenue per the annual reserve valuation prepared by our independent reserve engineers to the net book carrying value of the assets 
an analysis of the proved properties will also be performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset s carrying value may not be recoverable from future net revenue 
assets are grouped at the field level and if it is determined that the net book carrying value cannot be recovered by the estimated future undiscounted cash flow  they are written down to fair value 
cash flows used in the impairment analysis are determined based on our estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves  future crude oil and natural gas prices and costs to extract these reserves 
for our unproved properties  we perform an impairment analysis annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset s net book carrying value may not be recoverable 
derivatives and hedging 
we follow the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas requires the accounting recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value 
derivative instruments that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through net income 
under the provisions of sfas  we may designate a derivative instrument as hedging the exposure to change in fair value of an asset or liability that is attributable to a particular risk a fair value hedge or as hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are attributable to a particular risk a cash flow hedge 
both at the inception of a hedge and on an ongoing basis  a fair value hedge must be expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk during the periods that a hedge is designated 
similarly  a cash flow hedge must be expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk during the term of the hedge 
the expectation of hedge effectiveness must be supported by matching the essential terms of the hedged asset  liability or forecasted transaction to the derivative contract or by effectiveness assessments using statistical measurements 
our policy is to assess hedge effectiveness at the end of each calendar quarter 
income taxes 
we compute income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires an asset and liability approach which results in the recognition of deferred income taxes on the difference between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its carrying amount in our financial statements 
this difference will result in taxable income or deductions in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled  respectively 
considerable judgment is required in determining when these events may occur and whether recovery of an asset is more likely than not 
additionally  our federal and state income tax returns are generally not filed before the financial statements are prepared 
therefore we estimate the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at the end of each calendar year as well as the effects of tax rate changes  tax credits  and tax credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is recognized if it is determined that deferred tax assets may not be fully utilized in future periods 
adjustments related to differences between the estimates used and actual amounts reported are recorded in the period in which income tax returns are filed 
these adjustments and changes in estimates of asset recovery could have an impact on results of operations 
we may generate eor tax credits from the production of our heavy crude oil in california which results in a deferred tax asset and believe that these credits will be fully utilized in future years and consequently have not recorded any valuation allowance related to these credits 
due to uncertainties involved with tax matters  the future effective tax rate may vary significantly from the estimated current year effective tax rate 
asset retirement obligations 
we have significant obligations to plug and abandon oil and natural gas wells and related equipment at the end of oil and gas production operations 
the computation of our asset retirement obligations aro was prepared in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which requires us to record the fair value of liabilities for retirement obligations of long lived assets 
estimating the future aro requires management to make estimates and judgments regarding timing  current estimates of plugging and abandonment costs  as well as what constitutes adequate remediation 
we obtained estimates from third parties and used the present value of estimated cash flows related to our aro to determine the fair value 
inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate costs  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of settlement and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
changes in any of these assumptions can result in significant revisions to the estimated aro 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing aro liability  a corresponding adjustment will be made to the related asset 
due to the subjectivity of assumptions and the relatively long life of our assets  the ultimate costs to retire our wells may vary significantly from previous estimates 
environmental remediation liability 
we review  on a quarterly basis  our estimates of costs of the cleanup of various sites including sites in which governmental agencies have designated us as a potentially responsible party 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and where a minimum cost or a reasonable estimate of the cost of remediation can be determined  the applicable amount is accrued 
determining when expenses should be recorded for these contingencies and the appropriate amounts for accrual is an estimation process that includes the subjective judgment of management 
in many cases  management s judgment is based on the advice and opinions of legal counsel and other advisers  the interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by regulators or courts of law  our experience and the experience of other companies in dealing with similar matters and the decision of management on how it intends to respond to a particular matter 
a change in estimate could impact our oil and gas operating costs and the liability  if applicable  recorded on our balance sheet 
accounting for business combinations 
we have grown substantially through acquisitions and our business strategy is to continue to pursue acquisitions as opportunities arise 
we have accounted for all of our business combinations using the purchase method  which is the only method permitted under sfas the accounting for business combinations is complicated and involves the use of significant judgment 
under the purchase method of accounting  a business combination is accounted for at a purchase price based upon the fair value of the consideration given  whether in the form of cash  assets  stock or the assumption of liabilities 
the assets and liabilities acquired are measured at their fair values  and the purchase price is allocated to the assets and liabilities based upon these fair values 
the excess of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed over the cost of an acquired entity  if any  is allocated as a pro rata reduction of the amounts that otherwise would have been assigned to certain acquired assets 
determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired involves the use of judgment  since some of the assets and liabilities acquired do not have fair values that are readily determinable 
different techniques may be used to determine fair values  including market prices  where available  appraisals  comparisons to transactions for similar assets and liabilities and present value of estimated future cash flows  among others 
since these estimates involve the use of significant judgment  they can change as new information becomes available 
each of the business combinations completed were of interests in oil and gas assets 
we believe the consideration we paid to acquire these assets represents the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired at the time of acquisition 
consequently  we have not recognized any goodwill from any of our business combinations 
stock based compensation 
we adopted sfas no 
r to account for our stock option plan beginning january  this standard requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
we previously adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation effective january  the modified prospective method was selected as described in sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
under this method  we recognize stock option compensation expense as if we had applied the fair value method to account for unvested stock options from the original effective date 
stock option compensation expense is recognized from the date of grant to the vesting date 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model that uses the following assumptions 
expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of our stock 
we use historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model  separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes 
the expected term of options granted is based on historical exercise behavior and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding  the range results from certain groups of employees exhibiting different exercise behavior 
the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on us treasury rates in effect at the time of grant 
electricity cost allocation 
our investment in our cogeneration facilities has been for the express purpose of lowering steam costs in our california heavy oil operations and securing operating control of the respective steam generation 
such cogeneration operations produce electricity and steam and use natural gas as fuel 
we allocate steam costs to our oil and gas operating costs based on the conversion efficiency of fuel to electricity and steam of the cogeneration facilities plus certain direct costs in producing steam 
electricity revenue represents sales to the utilities 
electricity used in oil and gas operations is allocated at cost 
a portion of the capital costs of the cogeneration facilities is allocated to dd a oil and gas production 
capitalized interest 
interest incurred on funds borrowed to finance exploration and certain acquisition and development activities is capitalized 
to qualify for interest capitalization  the costs incurred must relate to the acquisition of unproved reserves  drilling of wells to prove up the reserves and the installation of the necessary pipelines and facilities to make the property ready for production 
such capitalized interest is included in oil and gas properties  buildings and equipment 
capitalized interest is amortized over the estimated life of the respective project 
recent accounting pronouncements 
in december  sfas no 
r  share based payment  was issued which establishes standards for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
this standard requires an issuer to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
in april  the sec issued a rule that sfas no 
r will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after june  as a result  we adopted this statement beginning january  we previously adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method did not have a material impact on our condensed financial statements for the year ended december  in may  sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
was issued 
sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior period financial statements for changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas no 
also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change 
indirect effects of a change in accounting principle should be recognized in the period of the accounting change 
sfas no 
became effective for our fiscal year beginning january  the adoption of sfas no 
had no effect to our financial position and result of operations 
in february  sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments an amendment of fasb statements no 
and was issued 
this statement resolves issues addressed in statement implementation issue no 
d  application of statement to beneficial interests in securitized financial assets 
sfas no 
will become effective for our fiscal year beginning after september  while there was no impact on our financial statements as of december   based on our existing derivatives  we may experience a financial impact depending on the nature and extent of any new derivative instruments entered into after the effective date of sfas no 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
this interpretation requires that realization of an uncertain income tax position must be more likely than not ie greater than likelihood of receiving a benefit before it can be recognized in the financial statements 
further  this interpretation prescribes the benefit to be recorded in the financial statements as the amount most likely to be realized assuming a review by tax authorities having all relevant information and applying current conventions 
this interpretation also clarifies the financial statement classification of tax related penalties and interest and sets forth new disclosures regarding unrecognized tax benefits 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and we will be required to adopt this interpretation in the first quarter of based on our evaluation as of december   we do not believe that the implementation of fin will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in september  sfas no 
 fair value measurements was issued by the fasb 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
will become effective for our fiscal year beginning january   and we are currently assessing the potential impact of this statement on our financial statements 
in september  staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
registrants must quantify the impact on current period financial statements of correcting all misstatements  including both those occurring in the current period and the effect of reversing those that have accumulated from prior periods 
this sab was adopted at december  the adoption of sab no 
had no effect on our financial position or on the results of our operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  which permits an entity to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value 
the objective of sfas no 
is to improve financial reporting by allowing entities to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by the measurement of related assets and liabilities using different attributes  without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
under sfas no 
 entities that elect the fair value option by instrument will report unrealized gains and losses in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
the fair value option election is irrevocable  unless a new election date occurs 
sfas no 
establishes presentation and disclosure requirements to help financial statement users understand the effect of the entity s election on its earnings  but does not eliminate disclosure requirements of other accounting standards 
assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value must be displayed on the face of the balance sheet 
this statement is effective beginning january  and we are evaluating this pronouncement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as discussed in note to the financial statements  to minimize the effect of a downturn in oil and gas prices and protect our profitability and the economics of our development plans  from time to time we enter into crude oil and natural gas hedge contracts 
the terms of contracts depend on various factors  including management s view of future crude oil and natural gas prices  acquisition economics on purchased assets and our future financial commitments 
this price hedging program is designed to moderate the effects of a severe crude oil and natural gas price downturn while allowing us to participate in any commodity price increases 
in california  we benefit from lower natural gas pricing as we are a consumer of natural gas in our operations and elsewhere  we benefit from higher natural gas pricing 
we have hedged  and may hedge in the future both natural gas purchases and sales as determined appropriate by management 
management regularly monitors the crude oil and natural gas markets and our financial commitments to determine if  when  and at what level some form of crude oil and or natural gas hedging and or basis adjustments or other price protection is appropriate in accordance with policy established by our board of directors 
currently  our hedges are in the form of swaps and collars 
however  we may use a variety of hedge instruments in the future to hedge wti or the index gas price 
we have crude oil sales contracts in place which are priced based on a correlation to wti 
natural gas for cogeneration and conventional steaming operations is purchased at the socal border price and we sell our produced gas in colorado and utah at the colorado interstate gas cig and questar index prices  respectively 
the following table summarizes our hedge position as of december  average average barrels floor ceiling mmbtu average term per day prices term per day price crude oil sales nymex wti collars natural gas sales nymex hh to cig basis swaps full year average full year average full year full year natural gas sales nymex hh collars average mmbtu per day floor ceiling prices st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter payments to our counterparties are triggered when the monthly average prices are above the swap or ceiling price in the case of our crude oil and natural gas sales hedges and below the swap price for our natural gas sales hedge positions 
conversely  payments from our counterparties are received when the monthly average prices are below the swap or floor price for our crude oil and natural gas sales hedges and above the swap price for our natural gas sales hedge positions 
as of february   we have converted  bbl d of our oil collars beginning on march  to a swap with a strike price of wti 
this swap is considered to be an effective cash flow hedge and the transaction cost to convert to this swap is estimated at 
million on an after tax basis 
we intend to proceed with additional conversions of our existing collars to swaps for a portion of our remaining collars if we can attain at least a wti strike price 
additionally  we entered into oil swaps for  bbl d at from march through december the collar strike prices will allow us to protect a significant portion of our future cash flow if oil prices decline below per barrel while still participating in any oil price increase up to per barrel on these volumes and if gas prices decline below approximately per mmbtu 
these hedges improve our financial flexibility by locking in significant revenues and cash flow upon a substantial decline in crude oil or natural gas prices 
it also allows us to develop our long lived assets and pursue exploitation opportunities with greater confidence in the projected economic outcomes and allows us to borrow a higher amount under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility 
while we have designated our hedges as cash flow hedges in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  it is possible that a portion of the hedge related to the movement in the wti to california heavy crude oil price differential may be determined to be ineffective 
likewise  we may have some ineffectiveness in our natural gas hedges due to the movement of hh pricing as compared to actual sales points 
if this occurs  the ineffective portion will directly impact net income rather than being reported as other comprehensive income 
while we believe that the differential will narrow and move closer toward its historical level over time  there are no assurances as to the movement in the differential 
if the differential were to change significantly  it is possible that our hedges  when marked to market  could have a material impact on earnings in any given quarter and  thus  add increased volatility to our net income 
the marked to market values reflect the liquidation values of such hedges and not necessarily the values of the hedges if they are held to maturity 
we entered into derivative contracts natural gas swaps and collar contracts on march  that did not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas because the price index for the location in the derivative instrument did not correlate closely with the item being hedged 
these contracts were recorded in the first quarter of at their fair value on the balance sheet and we recognized an unrealized net loss of approximately million on the income statement under the caption commodity derivatives 
we entered into natural gas basis swaps on the same volumes and maturity dates as the previous hedges in may which allowed for these derivatives to be designated as cash flow hedges going forward  causing an unrealized net gain of million to be recognized in the second quarter of the difference of 
million was recorded in other comprehensive income at the date the hedges were designated 
additionally  on june  and july  we entered into five year interest rate swaps for a fixed rate of approximately on million of our outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
these interest rate swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges 
the related cash flow impact of all of our derivative activities are reflected as cash flows from operating activities 
irrespective of the unrealized gains reflected in other comprehensive income  the ultimate impact to net income over the life of the hedges will reflect the actual settlement values 
all of these hedges have historically been deemed to be cash flow hedges with the marked to market valuations provided by external sources  based on prices that are actually quoted 
at december   accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of income taxes  consisted of million of unrealized losses from our crude oil and natural gas hedges 
deferred net losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss at december  are expected to be reclassified to earnings over the life of the contracts 
the use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions 
with respect to our hedging activities  we utilize multiple counterparties on our hedges and monitor each counterparty s credit rating 
net reduction of sales of oil and gas revenue due to hedging activities in millions net reduction of cost of gas due to hedging activities in millions net reduction in revenue per boe due to hedging activities based on nymex futures prices as of december   wti  hh we would expect to make pre tax future cash payments or to receive payments over the remaining term of our crude oil and natural gas hedges in place as follows impact of percent change in futures prices on earnings nymex futures average wti futures price crude oil gain loss in millions average hh futures price natural gas gain in millions net pre tax future cash payments and receipts by year in millions wti  hh wti  hh wti wti total interest rates 
our exposure to changes in interest rates results primarily from long term debt 
on october   we issued million of senior subordinated notes due in a public offering 
total long term debt outstanding at december  and was million and million  respectively 
interest on amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility is charged at libor plus to  with the exception of the million of principal for which we have a hedge in place to fix the interest rate at approximately plus the senior unsecured revolving credit facility s margin through june  based on year end credit facility borrowings  a change in interest rates would have a 
million after tax impact on our financial statements
