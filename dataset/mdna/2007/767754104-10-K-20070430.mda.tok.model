item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and our consolidated financial statements 
we sell approximately  different types of non prescription  or front end products 
the types and number of front end products in each store vary  and selections are based on customer needs and preferences and available space 
no single front end product category contributed significantly to our sales during fiscal  although certain front end product classes contributed in excess of to our sales 
our principal classes of products in fiscal were the following product class percentage of sales prescription drugs over the counter medications and personal care health and beauty aids general merchandise and other we offer approximately  products under the rite aid private brand  which contributed approximately of our front end sales in the categories where private brand products were offered in fiscal during fiscal  we added approximately products under our private brand 
we intend to continue to increase the number of private brand products 
we have a strategic alliance with gnc under which we have opened  gnc stores within rite aid stores 
we have incorporated the gnc store within rite aid store into our new and relocated stores and intend to incorporate the gnc store within riteaid store concept into the brooks eckerd stores that we acquire where appropriate 
technology all of our stores are integrated into a common information system  which enables our customers to fill or refill prescriptions in any of our stores throughout the country  reduces chances of adverse drug interactions  and enables our pharmacists to fill prescriptions more accurately and efficiently 
this system can be expanded to accommodate new stores 
we expect to integrate all of the brooks eckerd stores that we acquire into our information system following the consummation of the pending acquisition 
our customers may also order prescription refills over the internet through www 
riteaid 
com powered by drugstore 
com  or over the phone through our telephonic rapid automated refill systems  which we also expect to be made available at all of the brooks and eckerd stores that we acquire 
as of march  we had installed scriptpro automated pharmacy dispensing units  which are linked to our pharmacists computers and fill and label prescription drug orders  in stores  and we expect to extend this technology to the brooks and eckerd stores where appropriate 
the efficiency of scriptpro units allows our pharmacists to spend an increased amount of time consulting with our customers 
additionally  each of our stores employs point of sale technology that supports sales analysis and recognition of customer trends 
this same point of sale technology facilitates the maintenance of perpetual inventory records which together are the basis for our automated inventory replenishment process 
in fiscal  we completed the roll out of our next generation pharmacy dispensing system  and expanded e prescribing services to all of our stores 
we expect to integrate all of the brooks and eckerd stores that we acquire into our next generation pharmacy dispensing system and to extend e prescribing services to all of the brooks and eckerd stores that we acquire 
we believe our next generation pharmacy system has enhanced management of customers prescription orders  assignment of responsibilities within the pharmacy  quality control and measurement and monitoring of each of our pharmacies key performance indicators  which include timeliness  completeness  and backlog 
our next generation pharmacy system was designed with optimal ease of use in mind so as to further enable our pharmacists to work directly with customers and doctors 
suppliers we purchase almost all of our generic non brand name pharmaceuticals directly from manufacturers 
during fiscal  we purchased brand pharmaceuticals and some generic pharmaceuticals  which amounted to approximately of the dollar volume of our prescription drugs  from a single wholesaler  mckesson corp mckesson  under a contract  which runs through march we expect to continue to purchase a significant volume of our prescription drugs from mckesson subsequent to the pending acquisition 
under the contract  with limited exceptions  we are required to purchase all of our branded pharmaceutical products from mckesson 
if our relationship with mckesson was disrupted  we could temporarily have difficulty filling brand drug prescriptions until we executed a replacement strategy  which could negatively affect our business 
we purchase our non pharmaceutical merchandise from numerous manufacturers and wholesalers 
we believe that competitive sources are readily available for substantially all of the non pharmaceutical merchandise we carry and that the loss of any one supplier would not have a material effect on our business 
we sell private brand and co branded products that generally are supplied by numerous competitive sources 
the rite aid and gnc co branded pharmassure vitamin and mineral supplement products and the gnc branded vitamin and mineral supplement products that we sell in our stores are developed by gnc  and along with our rite aid brand vitamin and mineral supplements  are manufactured by gnc 
customers and third party payors during fiscal  our stores served an average of million customers per day 
the loss of any one customer would not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
in fiscal  of our pharmacy sales were to customers covered by health plan contracts which typically contract with third parties payors such as insurance companies  prescription benefit management companies  governmental agencies  private employers  health maintenance organizations or other managed care providers that agree to pay for all or a portion of a customer s eligible prescription purchases and negotiate with us for reduced prescription rates 
during fiscal  the top five third party payors accounted for approximately of our total sales  the largest of which represented of our total sales 
during fiscal  medicaid related sales were approximately of our total sales  of which the largest single medicaid payor was less than of our total sales 
competition the retail drugstore industry is highly competitive 
we compete with  among others  retail drugstore chains  independently owned drugstores  supermarkets  mass merchandisers  discount stores  dollar stores and mail order pharmacies 
we compete on the basis of store location and convenient access  customer service  product selection and price 
we believe continued consolidation of the drugstore industry  continued new store openings and increased mail order will further increase competitive pressures in the industry 
marketing and advertising in fiscal  marketing and advertising expense was million  which was spent primarily on weekly circular advertising 
we have implemented various programs that are designed to support our health and wellness vision and improve our image with customers by delivering upon our with us  it s personal brand promise 
these include health condition marketing platforms focused on specific health conditions  increased gnc presence through expanded locations and promotional activity  continuation of our rite aid health and beauty expos  and marketing and merchandising strategies that capitalize on emerging beauty trends such as men s grooming  spa products  proprietary cosmetics and skincare 
we continue to implement programs that are specifically directed to our pharmacy business 
these include promotions that provide incentives for customers that transfer their prescriptions to us  a card based loyalty program for senior citizens called living more that provides meaningful discounts and targeted newsletters and offers  direct marketing programs  comprehensive health condition management programs  and other educational materials to help customers with their healthcare decisions 
we are creating a more inviting store environment for our hispanic customers through tailored product assortments and bi lingual signing and advertising in stores with large hispanic customer bases 
associates we believe that our relationships with our associates are good 
as of march   we had approximately  associates  of which were pharmacists  of which were part time and of which were unionized 
associate satisfaction is critical to the success of our strategy 
we have surveyed our associates to obtain feedback on various employment related topics  including job satisfaction and their understanding of our core values and mission 
there is a national shortage of pharmacists 
we have implemented various associate incentive plans in order to attract and retain qualified pharmacists  have added a survey to find out how newly hired pharmacists are doing and have an advisory board made up entirely of associates that are pharmacists 
we have also expanded our efforts in recruitment of pharmacists through an increase in the number of recruiters  a successful pharmacist intern program  improved relations with pharmacy schools and an international recruiting program 
research and development we do not make significant expenditures for research and development 
licenses  trademarks and patents the rite aid name is our most significant trademark and the most important factor in marketing our stores and private brand products 
we hold licenses to sell beer  wine and liquor  cigarettes and lottery tickets 
as part of our strategic alliance with gnc we have a license to operate gnc stores within rite aid stores 
additionally  we hold licenses granted to us by the nevada gaming commission that allow us to place slot machines in our nevada stores 
we also hold licenses to operate our pharmacies and our distribution facilities 
together  these licenses are material to our operations 
seasonality we experience moderate seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations concentrated in the first and fourth fiscal quarters as the result of the concentration of the cough  cold and flu season and the holidays 
we tailor certain front end merchandise to capitalize on holidays and seasons 
we increase our inventory levels during our third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the seasonal fluctuations described above 
our results of operations in the fourth and first fiscal quarters may fluctuate based upon the timing and severity of the cough  cold and flu season  both of which are unpredictable 
regulation our business is subject to federal  state  and local government laws  regulations and administrative practices 
we must comply with numerous provisions regulating health and safety  equal employment opportunity  minimum wage and licensing for the sale of drugs  alcoholic beverages  tobacco and other products 
in addition we must comply with regulations pertaining to product labeling  dating and pricing 
pursuant to the omnibus budget reconciliation act of obra and comparable state regulations  our pharmacists are required to offer counseling  without additional charge  to our customers about medication  dosage  delivery systems  common side effects and other information deemed significant by the pharmacists and may have a duty to warn customers regarding any potential adverse effects of a prescription drug if the warning could reduce or negate such effect 
the appropriate state boards of pharmacy must license our pharmacies and pharmacists 
our pharmacies and distribution centers are also registered with the federal drug enforcement administration and are subject to federal drug enforcement agency regulations relative to our pharmacy operations  including regulations governing purchasing  storing and dispensing of controlled substances 
applicable licensing and registration requirements require our compliance with various state statutes  rules and or regulations 
if we were to violate any applicable statute  rule or regulation  our licenses and registrations could be suspended or revoked and we could be subject to fines or penalties 
in recent years  an increasing number of legislative proposals have been enacted  introduced or proposed in congress and in some state legislatures that effect or would effect major changes in the healthcare system  either nationally or at the state level 
the legislative initiatives include drug importation  changes in qualified participants and changes in reimbursement levels 
although we believe we are well positioned to respond to these developments  we cannot predict the long term outcome or effect of legislation from these efforts 
our pharmacy business is subject to patient privacy and other obligations  including corporate  pharmacy and associate responsibility imposed by the health insurance portability and accountability act 
as a covered entity  we are required to implement privacy standards  train our associates on the permitted uses and disclosures of protected health information  provide a notice of privacy practice to our pharmacy customers and permit pharmacy customers to access and amend their records and receive an accounting of disclosures of protected health information 
failure to properly adhere to these requirements could result in the imposition of civil as well as criminal penalties 
we are also subject to laws governing our relationship with our associates  including minimum wage requirements  overtime and working conditions 
increases in the federal minimum wage rate  associate benefit costs or other costs related to associates could adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  in connection with the ownership and operations of our stores  distribution centers and other sites  we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters  including those governing the management and disposal of hazardous substances and the cleanup of contaminated sites 
violations of or liabilities under these laws and regulations as a result of our current or former operations or historical activities at our sites  such as gasoline service stations and dry cleaners  could result in significant costs 
corporate governance and internet address we recognize that good corporate governance is an important means of protecting the interests of our stockholders  associates  customers  and the community

item a 
risk factors factors affecting our future prospects set forth below is a description of certain risk factors which we believe may be relevant to an understanding of us and our business 
security holders are cautioned that these and other factors may affect future performance and cause actual results to differ from those which may  from time to time  be anticipated 
see cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements 
risks related to our financial condition we are highly leveraged 
our substantial indebtedness could limit cash flow available for our operations and could adversely affect our ability to service debt or obtain additional financing if necessary 
we had  as of march   billion of outstanding indebtedness and stockholders equity of approximately billion 
we also had additional borrowing capacity under our existing billion senior secured revolving credit facility of approximately billion at that time  net of outstanding letters of credit of million 
at the time of closing for the pending acquisition  we will fund the billion cash portion of the purchase price with the issuance of additional debt 
our debt obligations adversely affect our operations in a number of ways and while we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital  debt service and capital expenditures through fiscal year  there can be no assurance that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to service our debt  which may require us to borrow additional funds for that purpose  restructure or otherwise refinance our debt 
our earnings were insufficient to cover fixed charges for fiscal    and by million  million  million  and million  respectively 
our ratio of earnings to fixed charges for fiscal was 
our high level of indebtedness will continue to restrict our operations 
among other things  our indebtedness will limit our ability to obtain additional financing  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in the markets in which we compete  place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less indebtedness  render us more vulnerable to general adverse economic  regulatory and industry conditions  and require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our debt 
our ability to meet our cash requirements  including our debt service obligations  both now and after the consummation of the pending acquisition  will be dependent upon our ability to substantially improve our operating performance  which will be subject to general economic and competitive conditions and to financial  business and other factors  many of which we cannot control 
if our cash flow from our operating activities is insufficient  we may take certain actions  including delaying or reducing capital or other expenditures  attempting to restructure or refinance our debt  selling assets or operations or seeking additional equity capital 
we may be unable to take any of these actions on satisfactory terms or in a timely manner 
further  any of these actions may not be sufficient to allow us to service our debt obligations or may have an adverse impact on our business 
our existing debt agreements limit our ability to take certain of these actions 
our failure to generate sufficient operating cash flow to pay our debts or to successfully undertake any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on us 
borrowings under our existing and new credit facilities and expenses related to the sale of our accounts receivable under our receivables securitization agreements are based upon variable rates of interest  which could result in higher expense in the event of increases in interest rates 
approximately million of our outstanding indebtedness as of march  and approximately billion of debt to be issued at the time of closing for the pending acquisition bears or will bear an interest rate that varies depending upon the londan interbank offered rate libor 
if we borrow additional amounts under our senior credit facility  the interest rate on those borrowings will also vary depending upon libor 
further  we pay ongoing program fees under our receivables securitization agreements that vary depending upon libor 
if libor rises  the interest rates on outstanding debt and the program fees under our receivables securitization program will increase 
therefore an increase in libor would increase our interest payment obligations under these loans  increase our receivables securitization program fee payments and have a negative effect on our cash flow and financial condition 
we currently do not maintain any hedging contracts that would limit our exposure to variable rates of interest 
the covenants in our current indebtedness and the indebtedness to be incurred to finance the acquisition impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility 
the covenants in the instruments that govern our current indebtedness and the indebtedness to be incurred in connection with the pending acquisition limit our ability to incur liens and debt  pay dividends  make redemptions and repurchases of capital stock  make loans and investments  prepay  redeem or repurchase debt  engage in acquisitions  consolidations  assets dispositions  sale leaseback transactions and affiliate transactions  change our business  amend some of our debt and other material agreements  issue and sell capital stock of subsidiaries  restrict distributions from subsidiaries  and grant negative pledges to other creditors 
in addition  if we have less than million of revolver availability under our senior secured credit facility  we will be subject to a fixed charge coverage ratio maintenance test 
if we are unable to meet the terms of the financial covenants or if we breach any of these covenants  a default could result under one or more of these agreements 
a default  if not waived by our lenders  could result in the acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness and cause our debt to become immediately due and payable 
if acceleration occurs  we would not be able to repay our debt and it is unlikely that we would be able to borrow sufficient additional funds to refinance such debt 
even if new financing is made available to us  it may not be available on terms acceptable to us 
if we obtain modifications of our agreements  or are required to obtain waivers of defaults  we may incur significant fees and transaction costs 
risks related to our operations we need to continue to improve our operations in order to improve our financial condition  but our operations will not improve if we cannot continue to effectively implement our business strategy or if our strategy is negatively affected by general economic conditions 
we have not yet achieved the sales productivity level of our major competitors 
we believe that improving the sales of existing stores is important to improving profitability and operating cash flow 
if we are not successful in implementing our strategy  or if our strategy is not effective  we may not be able to improve our operations 
in addition  any adverse change in general economic conditions or major industries can adversely affect drug benefit plans and reduce our pharmacy sales or can adversely affect consumer buying practices and reduce our sales of front end products  and cause a decrease in our profitability 
failure to continue to improve operations or a decline in major industries or general economic conditions would adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows and our ability to make principal or interest payments on our debt 
our new store and store relocation development program requires entering construction and development commitments and occasionally purchasing land that will not be utilized for several years which may limit our financial flexibility 
we will enter into significant construction and development commitments as part of our new store and store relocation development program 
also  we will occasionally make capital expenditures to acquire land that may not be used for several years 
even if there are significant negative economic or competitive developments in our industry  financial condition or the regions where we have made these commitments  we are obligated to fulfill these commitments 
further  if we subsequently dispose of the property that we acquire  we may receive less than our purchase price or the net book value of such property  which may result in financial loss 
we are dependent on our management team  and the loss of their services could have a material adverse effect on our business and the results of our operations or financial condition 
the success of our business is materially dependent upon the continued services of our executive management team 
the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations  financial condition or cash flows 
additionally  we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or retain other skilled personnel in the future 
we are substantially dependent on a single wholesaler of branded pharmaceutical products to sell products to us on satisfactory terms 
a disruption in this relationship may have a negative effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
we purchase all of our brand prescription drugs from a single wholesaler  mckesson  pursuant to a contract that runs through march pharmacy sales represented approximately of our total sales during fiscal  and  therefore  our relationship with mckesson is important to us 
any significant disruptions in our relationship with mckesson would make it difficult for us to continue to operate our business until we executed a replacement strategy 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to find a replacement supplier on a timely basis or that such supplier would be able to fulfill our demands on similar terms  which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
risks related to our industry the markets in which we operate are very competitive and further increases in competition could adversely affect us 
we face intense competition with local  regional and national companies  including other drugstore chains  independently owned drugstores  supermarkets  mass merchandisers  discount stores  dollar stores and mail order pharmacies 
our industry also faces growing competition from companies who import drugs directly from other countries  such as canada  as well as from large scale retailers that offer generic drugs at a substantial discount 
some of our competitors have or may merge with or acquire pharmaceutical services companies  which may further increase competition 
we may not be able to effectively compete against them because our existing or potential competitors may have financial and other resources that are superior to ours 
in addition  we may be at a competitive disadvantage because we are more highly leveraged than our competitors 
the ability of our stores to achieve profitability depends on their ability to achieve a critical mass of customers 
we believe that the continued consolidation of the drugstore industry will further increase competitive pressures in the industry 
as competition increases  a significant increase in general pricing pressures could occur  which would require us to increase our sales volume and to sell higher margin products and services in order to remain competitive 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue effectively to compete in our markets or increase our sales volume in response to further increased competition 
drug benefit plan sponsors and third party payors could change their plan eligibility criteria and further encourage or require the use of mail order prescriptions which could decrease our sales and reduce our margins and have a material adverse effect on our business 
an adverse trend for drugstore retailing has been initiatives to contain rising healthcare costs leading to the rapid growth in mail order prescription processors 
these prescription distribution methods have grown in market share relative to drugstores as a result of the rapid rise in drug costs experienced in recent years and are predicted to continue to rise 
mail order prescription distribution methods are perceived by employers and insurers as being less costly than traditional distribution methods and are being encouraged  and  in some cases  required  by third party pharmacy benefit managers  employers and unions that administer benefits 
as a result  some labor unions and employers are requiring  and others may encourage or require  that their members or employees obtain medications from mail order pharmacies which offer drug prescriptions at prices lower than we are able to offer 
another adverse trend for drugstore retailing has been for drug benefit plan sponsors and third party payors to change their plan eligibility requirements resulting in fewer beneficiaries covered and a reduction in the number of prescriptions allowed 
mail order prescription distribution and drug benefit plan eligibility changes have negatively affected sales for traditional chain drug retailers  including us  in the last few years and we expect such negative effect to continue in the future 
there can be no assurance that our efforts to offset the effects of mail order and eligibility changes will be successful 
the availability of pharmacy drugs is subject to governmental regulations 
the continued conversion of various prescription drugs to over the counter medications may reduce our pharmacy sales and customers may seek to purchase such medications at non pharmacy stores 
also  if the rate at which new prescription drugs become available slows or if new prescription drugs that are introduced into the market fail to achieve popularity  our pharmacy sales may be adversely affected 
the withdrawal of certain drugs from the market or concerns about the safety or effectiveness of certain drugs or negative publicity surrounding certain categories of drugs may also have a negative effect on our pharmacy sales or may cause shifts in our pharmacy or front end product mix 
changes in third party reimbursement levels for prescription drugs could reduce our margins and have a material adverse effect on our business 
sales of prescription drugs  as a percentage of sales  and the percentage of prescription sales reimbursed by third parties  have been increasing and we expect them to continue to increase 
in fiscal  sales of prescription drugs represented of our sales and of all of the prescription drugs that we sold were with third party payors 
during fiscal  the top five third party payors accounted for approximately of our total sales  the largest of which represented of our total sales 
third party payors could reduce the levels at which they will reimburse us for the prescription drugs that we provide to their members 
any significant loss of third party payor business or any significant reduction in reimbursement levels could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
in fiscal  approximately of our revenues were from state sponsored medicaid agencies  the largest of which was of our total sales 
in fiscal  approximately of our prescription sales were to customers covered by medicare part d  and we expect these sales to continue 
there have been a number of recent proposals and enactments by the federal government and various states to reduce medicaid reimbursement levels in response to budget problems  some of which propose to reduce reimbursement levels in the applicable states significantly  and we expect other similar proposals in the future 
if third party payors reduce their reimbursement levels or if medicare part d or state medicaid programs cover prescription drugs at lower reimbursement levels  our margins on these sales would be reduced  and the profitability of our business and our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows could be adversely affected 
we are subject to governmental regulations  procedures and requirements  our noncompliance or a significant regulatory change could adversely affect our business  the results of our operations or our financial condition 
our business is subject to federal  state and local government laws  regulations and administrative practices 
we must comply with numerous provisions regulating health and safety  equal employment opportunity  minimum wage and licensing for the sale of drugs  alcoholic beverages  tobacco and other products 
in addition  we must comply with regulations pertaining to product labeling  dating and pricing 
our pharmacy business is subject to local registrations in the states where our pharmacies are located  applicable medicare and medicaid regulations and prohibitions against paid referrals of patients 
failure to properly adhere to these and other applicable regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties including suspension of payments from government programs  loss of required government certifications  loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government reimbursement programs  such as the medicare and medicaid programs  loss of licenses  significant fines or monetary penalties for anti kickback law violations  submission of false claims or other failures to meet reimbursement program requirements and could adversely affect the continued operation of our business 
our pharmacy business is subject to the patient privacy and other obligations including corporate  pharmacy and associate responsibility  imposed by the health insurance portability and accountability act 
as a covered entity  we are required to implement privacy standards  train our associates on the permitted use and disclosures of protected health information  provide a notice of privacy practice to our pharmacy customers and permit pharmacy health customers to access and amend their records and receive an accounting of disclosures of protected health information 
failure to properly adhere to these requirements could result in the imposition of civil as well as criminal penalties 
federal and state reform programs  such as healthcare reform and enforcement initiatives of federal and state governments may also affect our pharmacy business 
these initiatives include proposals designed to significantly reduce spending on medicare  medicaid and other government programs  changes in programs providing for reimbursement for the cost of prescription drugs by third party plans  increased scrutiny of  and litigation relating to  prescription drug manufacturers pricing and marketing pactices  and regulatory changes relating to the approval process for prescription drugs 
these initiatives could lead to the enactment of  or changes to  federal regulations and state regulations that could adversely impact our prescription drug sales and  accordingly  our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
it is uncertain at this time what additional healthcare reform initiatives  if any  will be implemented  or whether there will be other changes in the administration of governmental healthcare programs or interpretations of governmental policies or other changes affecting the healthcare system 
future healthcare or budget legislation or other changes  including those referenced above  may materially adversely impact our pharmacy sales 
certain risks are inherent in providing pharmacy services  our insurance may not be adequate to cover any claims against us 
pharmacies are exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products  such as with respect to improper filling of prescriptions  labeling of prescriptions  adequacy of warnings and unintentional distribution of counterfeit drugs 
in addition  federal and state laws that require our pharmacists to offer counseling  without additional charge  to their customers about medication  dosage  delivery systems  common side effects and other information the pharmacists deem significant can impact our business 
our pharmacists may also have a duty to warn customers regarding any potential negative effects of a prescription drug if the warning could reduce or negate these effects 
although we maintain professional liability and errors and omissions liability insurance  from time to time  claims result in the payment of significant amounts  some portions of which are not funded by insurance 
we cannot assure you that the coverage limits under our insurance programs will be adequate to protect us against future claims  or that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future 
our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in liability for which we self insure or we suffer reputational harm as a result of an error or omission 
we will not be able to compete effectively if we are unable to attract  hire and retain qualified pharmacists 
there is a nationwide shortage of qualified pharmacists 
however  we may not be able to attract  hire and retain enough qualified pharmacists 
this could adversely affect our operations 
we may be subject to significant liability should the consumption of any of our products cause injury  illness or death 
products that we sell could become subject to contamination  product tampering  mislabeling or other damage requiring us to recall our private label products 
in addition  errors in the dispensing and packaging of pharmaceuticals could lead to serious injury or death 
product liability claims may be asserted against us with respect to any of the products or pharmaceuticals we sell and we may be obligated to recall our private brand products 
a product liability judgment against us or a product recall could have a material  adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
risks related to the pending acquisition although we expect that the pending acquisition of the brooks and eckerd drugstore chains will result in benefits to us  we may not realize those benefits because of integration difficulties 
integrating the operations of the brooks and eckerd drugstore chains successfully or otherwise realizing any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition including anticipated cost savings and additional revenue opportunities  involve a number of potential challenges 
the failure to meet these integration challenges could seriously harm our results of operations 
realizing the benefits of the acquisition will depend in part on the integration of information technology  operations and personnel 
these integration activities are complex and time consuming and we may encounter unexpected difficulties or incur unexpected costs  including diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns to integration matters  difficulties in consolidating and rationalizing information technology platforms and administrative infrastructures  difficulties in integrating the brooks and eckerd store operations to serve the combined customer base of rite aid and the brooks and eckerd drugstore chains  difficulties in converting the distribution centers  difficulties in combining corporate cultures  maintaining associate morale and retaining key associates  and challenges in demonstrating to our customers and to customers of the brooks and eckerd drugstore chains that the acquisition will not result in adverse changes in customer service standards or business focus 
we expect to spend approximately million of integration related capital expenditures and to incur million of integration related non recurring expenses during the month integration period 
if the anticipated benefits and synergies are not realized  or if the integration related expenses and capital requirements are greater than anticipated  the anticipated accretive effect of the acquisition could be decreased or delayed  which could cause a decline in the price of our common stock 
moreover  the brooks and eckerd chains are not fully integrated with one another and in many instances operate using different systems 
as a result  following the pending acquisition  we will be undertaking to integrate not one but two drugstore chains into our operations 
complications in integrating these two drugstore chains could increase our integration costs and make it more difficult to achieve a successful integration following the acquisition 
we may not successfully integrate the operations of the brooks and eckerd drugstore chains in a timely manner and we may not realize the anticipated net reductions in costs and expenses and other benefits and synergies of the pending acquisition of the brooks and eckerd drugstore chains to the extent  or in the timeframe  anticipated 
in addition to the integration risks discussed above  our ability to realize these net reductions in costs and expenses and other benefits and synergies could be adversely impacted by practical or legal constraints on our ability to combine operations 
following the pending acquisition  for so long as jean coutu group and  subject to certain conditions  certain members of the coutu family maintain certain levels of rite aid stock ownership  jean coutu group and  subject to certain conditions  certain members of the coutu family will exercise significant influence over us 
when the pending acquisition is completed  jean coutu group will own approximately of the voting power of rite aid 
as a result  jean coutu group and  subject to certain conditions  certain members of the coutu family generally will have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of any matter submitted for the vote of rite aid stockholders 
the stockholder agreement provides that jean coutu group and  subject to certain conditions  certain members of the coutu family will designate four of the fourteen members of the rite aid board of directors  subject to adjustment based on its ownership position in rite aid 
accordingly  jean coutu group generally will be able to significantly influence the outcome of all matters that come before the rite aid board of directors 
as a result of its significant interest in rite aid  jean coutu group may have the power  subject to applicable law including the fiduciary duties of the directors designated by jean coutu group  to significantly influence actions that might be favorable to jean coutu group  but not necessarily favorable to rite aid s financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the ownership position and governance rights of jean coutu group could discourage a third party from proposing a change of control or other strategic transaction concerning rite aid 
as a result  the common stock of rite aid could trade at a price that does not reflect a takeover premium to the same extent as do the stocks of similarly situated companies that do not have a stockholder with an ownership interest as large as that of jean coutu group 
we will incur significant indebtedness in connection with the acquisition of the brooks and eckerd drugstore chains and the resulting debt service obligations may significantly limit our ability to execute our business strategy and increase the risk of default under our debt obligations 
we intend to borrow approximately billion in connection with our financing for the acquisition of the brooks and eckerd drugstore chains 
it is a condition to the completion of the acquisition that we shall have received the proceeds of the financing in an amount sufficient to consummate the acquisition 
although we currently expect that such financing will be available on commercially reasonable terms  there can be no assurance of this 
if we are unable to consummate a permanent debt financing  we may enter into a bridge facility of up to billion that is likely to be on terms substantially more restrictive and is likely to be more costly than the terms of the contemplated financing 
following the completion of the acquisition  our ability to meet our cash requirements  including our debt service obligations  will be dependent upon our ability to substantially improve our operating performance  which will be subject to general economic and competitive conditions and to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are or may be beyond our control 
in addition  some of these debt service obligations have interest payments that are subject to variable interest rates and are therefore dependent upon future interest rates which are beyond our control 
we cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations to fund these cash requirements and debt service obligations 
if our operating results  cash flow or capital resources prove inadequate  or if interest rates increase significantly  we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt and other obligations 
if we are unable to service our debt  we could be forced to reduce or delay planned expansions and capital expenditures  sell assets  restructure or refinance our debt or seek additional equity capital  and we may be unable to take any of these actions on satisfactory terms or in a timely manner 
further  any of these actions may not be sufficient to allow us to service our debt obligations or may have an adverse impact on our business 
our existing debt agreements limit our ability to take certain of these actions 
our failure to generate sufficient operating cash flow to pay our debts or to successfully undertake any of these actions could have a material adverse effects on us 
in addition  the degree to which we may be leveraged as a result of the indebtedness incurred in connection with the acquisition or otherwise could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements or other purposes  could make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic  regulatory and industry conditions  could limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes and opportunities in the markets in which we compete  could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our debt

the announcement and pendency of the pending acquisition could cause disruptions of the business of the brooks and eckerd drugstore chains 
specifically certain vendors may change their programs or processes which might adversely affect the supply or cost of the products  which then might adversely affect brooks and eckerds stores sales or gross profit  current and prospective associates of the brooks and eckerd drugstore chains may experience uncertainty about their future roles with rite aid  which might adversely affect the ability of the brooks and eckerd drugstore chains to attract and retain key personnel  and current and prospective customers of the brooks and eckerd drugstore chains may experience uncertainty about the ability of the brooks and eckerd stores to meet their needs  which might cause customers to make purchases or fill their prescriptions elsewhere 
these disruptions could be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of the pending acquisition and could have an adverse effect on the business  financial condition or results of operations of the brooks and eckerd drugstore chains prior to the completion of the pending acquisition and on rite aid following the completion of the pending acquisition 
the pending acquisition is subject to the approvals from government entities that may not be received as well as certain closing conditions that may not be satisfied or waived 
failure to consummate the pending acquisition could have a material adverse effect on us 
we cannot complete the pending acquisition unless we receive various consents  approvals and clearances from antitrust and other authorities in the united states 
while we believe that we will receive the requisite approvals from these authorities  there can be no assurance of this 
the stock purchase agreement we entered into with jean coutu group contains numerous conditions to closing  the satisfaction or waiver of which are required to complete the pending acquisition 
the conditions include  among others  the accuracy of our and jean coutu group s respective representations and warranties in the stock purchase agreement  as well as the performance in all material respects by us and the jean coutu group of our and its respective obligations under the stock purchase agreement 
there can be no assurance that the conditions required to consummate the pending acquisition will be satisfied or waived 
if the pending acquisition is not consummated for any reason  we will have incurred substantial expenses without realizing the anticipated benefits of the pending acquisition  including anticipated net reductions in costs and expenses 
we have incurred substantial legal  accounting and financial advisory fees and our management has devoted considerable time and effort in connection with the pending acquisition 
conflicts of interest may arise between us and jean coutu group  which may be resolved in a manner that adversely affects our business  financial condition or results of operations 
after the pending acquisition  jean coutu group will continue its canadian operations but will no longer have any operations in the united states  we currently have no operations in canada 
despite the lack of geographic overlap after the transaction  conflicts of interest may arise between us and jean coutu group in areas relating to past  ongoing and future relationships  including corporate opportunities  potential acquisitions or financing transactions  sales or other dispositions by jean coutu group of its interests in us and the exercise by jean coutu group of its influence over our management and affairs 
after the completion of the pending acquisition  a number of the directors on the rite aid board of directors will be persons who are also officers or directors of jean coutu group or its subsidiaries 
service as a director or officer of both rite aid and jean coutu group or its other subsidiaries could create conflicts of interest if such directors or officers are faced with decisions that could have materially different implications for rite aid and for jean coutu group 
apart from the conflicts of interest policy contained in rite aid s code of ethics and business conduct and applicable to rite aid directors  the parties have not established any formal procedures for rite aid and jean coutu group to resolve potential or actual conflicts of interest between them 
there can be no assurance that any of the foregoing conflicts will be resolved in a manner that does not adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
following the completion of the pending acquisition  we will be dependent on jean coutu group for certain transitional services pursuant to a transition services agreement 
the failure of jean coutu group to perform its obligations under the transition services agreement could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our ability to effectively monitor and control the operations of the brooks and eckerd drugstore chains we are acquiring depends to a large extent on the proper functioning of our information technology and business support systems 
following the completion of the acquisition  we will be initially dependent upon jean coutu group to continue to provide certain information technology  network and support services to the brooks and eckerd stores for a period of time after the completion of the acquisition to facilitate the transition of the brooks and eckerd drugstore chains 
the terms of these arrangements will be governed by a transition services agreement to be entered into as of the closing of the acquisition 
rite aid and jean coutu group are obligated to negotiate in good faith the transition services agreement 
if  however  we fail to reach a satisfactory agreement with respect to certain services or jean coutu group falls to perform its obligations under the transition services agreement  we may not be able to perform such services ourselves or obtain such services from third parties at all or on terms favorable to us 
in addition  upon termination of the transition services agreement  if we are unable to develop the necessary systems  resources and controls necessary to allow us to provide the services currently being provided by jean coutu group or to obtain such services from third parties  it could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
subject to certain limitations  jean coutu group may sell rite aid common stock at any time following the completion of the acquisition of the brooks and eckerd drugstore chains  which could cause our stock price to decrease 
the shares of rite aid common stock that jean coutu group will receive following the completion of the acquisition of the brooks and eckerd drugstore chains are restricted  but jean coutu group may sell these shares following the acquisition under certain circumstances  including pursuant to a registered underwritten public offering under the securities act or in accordance with rule under the securities act 
we have entered into a registration rights agreement with jean coutu group  which will give jean coutu group the right to require us to register all or a portion of its shares at any time 
the sale of a substantial number of our shares by jean coutu group or our other stockholders within a short period of time could cause our stock price to decrease  make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of rite aid common stock or acquire other businesses using rite aid common stock as consideration 
upon successful completion of the pending acquisition  we will be able to issue more shares of our common stock than currently authorized 
as a result  such future issuances of our common stock could have a dilutive effect on the earnings per share and voting power of current stockholders 
the amendment to our restated certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of rite aid common stock has been approved by our stockholders 
therefore  upon completion of the acquisition  we will be able to issue more shares of our common stock than currently authorized 
current rite aid stockholders do not have preemptive rights with respect to our common stock 
if the rite aid board of directors elects to issue additional shares of common stock in the future  whether in public offerings  in connection with mergers and acquisitions  or otherwise  such additional issuances could dilute the earnings per share and voting power of current stockholders 
additionally  the amendment to our restated certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of rite aid common stock  which will become effective upon completion of the pending acquisition  could have an anti takeover effect under some circumstances

we maintained a valuation allowance of million against net deferred tax assets as of march  net income for fiscal included state tax expense of million for an increase in the valuation allowance associated with our state net operating loss carryforwards 
decreases during the current year to the valuation allowance related primarily to the expiration of capital loss and state net operating loss carryforwards which had been fully reserved as of the beginning of the fiscal year 
the net decrease in the valuation allowance was million 
net income included benefits of  million and million  during fiscal and  respectively  related to the recognition of net deferred tax assets as a result of the release of a tax valuation allowance 
based upon a review of a number of factors  including historical operating performance and our expectation that we can generate sustainable consolidated taxable income for the foreseeable future  we concluded at the end of fiscal that the majority of the net deferred tax assets would be utilized 
thus  pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 we recorded a tax benefit during fiscal releasing a majority of the remaining valuation allowance  resulting in a non cash increase in net income of  million 
based upon the then available factors at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a tax benefit for a portion of our net deferred tax assets by releasing a portion of our valuation allowance  resulting in a non cash increase in net income of million during fiscal debt refinancing and receivables securitization 
in fiscal years  and  we took several steps to extend the terms of our debt  lower our interest rates and obtain more flexibility 
in fiscal  we issued our senior secured notes due january  the proceeds of which were used to redeem our senior secured notes due february we incurred a charge to call these notes prior to maturity and recorded a write off of unamortized debt issue costs 
these items totaled million  which was recorded as a loss on debt modification in fiscal in fiscal  we amended our senior secured credit facility to consist solely of a billion revolving credit facility  paid at maturity the remaining outstanding principal on two existing notes and completed the early redemption of another existing note 
as a result of amending our senior secured credit facility and the early redemption of an existing note  we recorded a loss on debt modification of million 
in fiscal  we replaced our senior secured credit facility with a new credit facility  entered into receivables securitization agreements  issued new senior secured notes and repurchased portions of several existing notes prior to maturity 
as a result of entering into the new senior secured credit facility and the receivables securitization agreements  we recorded a loss on debt modification of million  offset by net gains of million related to the note repurchases described above 
these transactions are discussed in more detail in the liquidity and capital resources section below 
hurricane katrina 
on august   hurricane katrina made landfall in louisiana and proceeded to move through mississippi and alabama  causing one of the worst natural disasters in the history of the united states 
as a result of this disaster  we had to close stores  which resulted in lost inventory and fixed assets 
we also incurred repair and maintenance charges related to our clean up efforts 
we received advance payments from our insurance carriers of million in fiscal these payments  less the amounts of inventory and fixed assets written off and other katrina related costs incurred  were deferred at the end of fiscal in february  we entered into a final binding settlement of our claims under hurricane katrina with our insurance carriers 
as a result of this settlement  we recorded a gain in fiscal of million 
the portion of this gain related to reimbursement for lost and damaged fixed assets was million and was recorded as a gain on sale of assets and investments 
the portion relating to reimbursement for lost or damaged inventory was million and was recorded as a reduction of costs of goods sold 
the portion of this gain related to repair and maintenance and other clean up charges was million and was recorded as a reduction of selling  general and administrative expenses sg a

under the terms of the agreement  we will acquire the acquisition from jean coutu group all of the membership interests of the jean coutu group pjc usa  inc jean coutu usa  a wholly owned subsidiary of jean coutu group  which is engaged in the business of owning and operating retail pharmacy stores conducting business under the eckerd and brooks banners 
as consideration for the acquisition  we will issue million shares of rite aid common stock and will pay billion in cash  subject to a working capital adjustment 
we intend to finance the acquisition through the issuance of new debt 
the shares of rite aid common stock issuable to jean coutu group in the acquisition will represent approximately of our total voting power after giving effect to the acquisition 
upon the closing of the acquisition  we will expand our board of directors to members  with four of the seats being held by members designated by jean coutu group 
in connection with entering into the stock purchase agreement  on august   we entered into a stockholder agreement the stockholder agreement with jean coutu group and certain coutu family members that will become effective upon consummation of the acquisition and will govern  among other matters  jean coutu group s ownership interest in rite aid 
the stockholder agreement contains provisions relating to board and board committee composition  corporate governance  stock ownership  stock purchase rights  transfer restrictions  voting arrangements and other matters 
we also entered into a registration rights agreement with jean coutu group giving jean coutu group certain rights with respect to the registration under the securities act of  as amended  of the shares of our common stock to be issued to jean coutu group or acquired by jean coutu group pursuant to certain stock purchase rights or open market purchase rights under the stockholder agreement

in addition to favorable demographic trends  our script growth was positively impacted by medicare part d and by initiatives such as our focus on customer satisfaction  prescription file buys  our senior loyalty program  our health condition programs and the new and relocated store program 
these items were partially offset primarily by an increase in generic sales  a milder cough  cold and flu season and lower reimbursement rates  including lower reimbursement rates from the medicare part d program

gross margin rate was also negatively impacted by the recording of a lifo charge of million in fiscal compared to a milion charge in fiscal our pharmacy gross profit had a slight positive contribution to consolidated gross margin rate due to the increase in sales 
however  our pharmacy gross margin rate was down slightly 
although there was an increase in generic prescriptions and a reduction in pharmacy shrink  these positive factors were offset by a reduction in reimbursement rates  particularly from medicare part d prescriptions

store and equipment lease exit charges 
in fiscal   and  we recorded charges for   and stores  respectively  to be closed or relocated under long term leases 
we calculate our liability for closed stores on a store by store basis 
the calculation includes the future minimum lease payments and related ancillary costs  from the date of closure to the end of the remaining lease term  net of estimated cost recoveries that may be achieved through subletting properties or through favorable lease terminations 
this liability is discounted using a risk free rate of interest 
we evaluate these assumptions each quarter and adjust the liability accordingly 
as part of our ongoing business activities  we will continue to assess stores for potential closure 
there can be no assurance that other such actions may not be required in the future  or that such actions would not have a material adverse effect on our operating results for the period in which we take those actions 
interest expense in fiscal   and  interest expense was million  million and million  respectively 
interest expense for decreased from due to an extra week in fiscal which was partially offset by slightly higher borrowings and slightly higher interest rates

the fiscal benefit includes a state tax benefit of million which primarily related to an increase in the our state tax rate applied to the net deferred tax assets partially offset by state tax expense of million related to an increase in the valuation allowance 
the fiscal benefit was primarily comprised of a federal and state tax benefit of  million for the release of valuation allowances for net deferred tax assets that have an expected future utilization 
the fiscal benefit was comprised of a tax benefit of million for the release of valuation allowance offset by tax expense of million consisting primarily of state income taxes 
generally accepted accounting principles require that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax provision in the period of change 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is required  we take into account all available positive and negative evidence with regard to the utilization of a deferred tax asset including our past earnings history  expected future earnings  the character and jurisdiction of such earnings  unsettled circumstances that  if unfavorably resolved  would adversely affect utilization of a deferred tax asset  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
significant judgment is required in making these assessments 
based upon a review of a number of factors  including historical operating performance and our expectation that we can generate sustainable consolidated taxable income for the foreseeable future  we concluded at the end of fiscal that the majority of the net deferred tax assets would be utilized 
thus  pursuant to sfas no 
 we recorded a tax benefit during fiscal releasing a majority of the remaining valuation allowance  resulting in a non cash increase in net income of  million 
based upon the then available factors at the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a tax benefit for a portion of our net deferred tax assets by releasing a portion of our valuation allowance  resulting in a non cash increase in net income of million during fiscal until the fourth quarter of fiscal  we provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
we will continue to monitor all available evidence related to our ability to utilize our remaining net deferred tax assets 
we maintained a valuation allowance of million and million against remaining net deferred tax assets at fiscal year end and  respectively 
the majority of the valuation allowance relates to state net operating loss carryforwards 
we underwent an ownership change for statutory tax purposes during fiscal  which resulted in a limitation on the future use of net operating loss carryforwards 
this limitation was considered when determining the required level for the valuation allowance 
liquidity and capital resources general we have five primary sources of liquidity i cash and cash equivalents  ii cash provided by operating activities  iii the sale of accounts receivable under our receivable securitization agreements  iv the revolving credit facility under our senior secured credit facility  and v sale leasebacks of owned property 
our principal uses of cash are to provide working capital for operations  to service our obligations to pay interest and principal on debt  to provide funds for capital expenditures and to provide funds for payment and repurchase of our debt

pursuant to the terms of the senior secured facility amendment  we established a senior secured term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of million and borrowed the full amount thereunder 
proceeds from the borrowings under the new senior secured term loan facility the tranche term loans were used to pay amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility  which had been used to repay  at maturity  the outstanding principal and accrued interest payable under our senior secured notes due september the tranche term loans currently bear interest at libor plus  if we choose to make libor borrowings  or at citibank s base rate plus 
the interest rate can fluctuate depending on the amount of availability under our revolving credit facility  as specified in the senior secured credit facility 
the amounts outstanding under the tranche term loans become due and payable in september  or earlier  if there is a shortfall in our borrowing base under the revolving credit facility 
in addition to the issuance of the tranche term loans  the lenders to the senior secured credit facility agreed to establish  in connection with the acquisition  an additional senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of billion the tranche term loans 
we expect to draw the full amount of the tranche term loans upon closing of the acquisition and to use the proceeds to pay a portion of the consideration for the acquisition 
in addition to the tranche term loans described above  our senior credit facility consists of a billion revolving credit facility 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility currently bear interest at libor plus  if we choose to make libor borrowings  or at citibank s base rate plus 
the interest rate can fluctuate depending on the amount of revolver availability  as specified in the senior secured credit facility 
we are required to pay fees of per annum on the daily unused amount of the revolving credit facility 
the amounts drawn on the revolving credit facility become due and payable in september the senior secured credit facility allows us to have outstanding  at any time  up to billion in secured subordinated debt in addition to the senior secured credit facility which amount is reduced by any additional unsecured debt that matures prior to december   as described below 
we have the ability to incur additional unsecured debt of up to million with a scheduled maturity date prior to december  the maximum amount of additional secured second priority debt and unsecured debt with a maturity prior to december  that can be incurred is billion 
at march   remaining additional permitted secured second priority debt under the senior secured credit facility was million in addition to what is available under the revolver  however  other debentures do not permit additional secured debt if the revolving credit facility is fully drawn 
the amendment of our senior secured credit facility that will occur at the closing of the acquisition will permit the issuance of the tranche and tranche term loans discussed above without reducing our ability to incur additional secured or unsecured debt under the senior secured credit facility 
the senior secured credit facility allows us to incur an unlimited amount of unsecured debt with a maturity beyond december   however  other debentures limit the amount of unsecured debt that can be incurred if certain interest coverage levels are not met at the time of incurrence of said debt 
the senior secured facility also allows for the repurchase of any debt with a maturity on or before december  and for the repurchase of debt with a maturity after december  if we maintain availability on the revolving credit facility of at least million 
the senior secured credit facility contains covenants  which place restrictions on the incurrence of debt beyond the restrictions described above  the payment of dividends  mergers and acquisitions and the granting of liens 
the senior secured credit facility also requires us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  but only if availability on the revolving credit facility is less than million 
the senior secured credit facility provides for events of default including nonpayment  misrepresentation  breach of covenants and bankruptcy 
it is also an event of default if we fail to make any required payment on debt having a principal amount in excess of million or any event occurs that enables  or which with the giving of notice or the lapse of time would enable  the holder of such debt to accelerate the maturity of such debt 
our ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility is based upon a specified borrowing base consisting of inventory and prescription files 
at march   we had million of borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
at december   we also had letters of credit outstanding against the revolving credit facility of million  which gave us additional borrowing capacity of  million 
other transactions in february  we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due these notes are unsubordinated obligations of rite aid corporation and rank equally in right of payment with all other unsubordinated indebtedness

the guarantees are secured  subject to the permitted liens  by shared second priority liens  with holders of our senior secured notes due and our senior secured notes due  granted by subsidiary guarantors on all their assets that secure the obligations under the senior secured credit facility  subject to certain exceptions 
the indenture governing the senior secured notes due contains covenant provisions that  among other things  include limitations on our ability to pay dividends  make investments or other restricted payments  incur debt  grant liens  sell assets and enter into sale leaseback transactions 
proceeds from this offering were used to repay outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility and to fund the redemption of our senior secured notes due  by deposit into an escrow fund with an independent trustee

we accounted for of these leases as operating leases and the remaining five leases were accounted for using the financing method  as these lease agreements contain a clause that allows the buyer to force us to repurchase the property under certain conditions 
financing for the pending acquisition on the closing date of the acquisition  we intend to i issue and sell one or more tranches of notes in an aggregate amount of billion and ii borrow billion of tranche term loans available to us under our senior secured credit facility 
depending on the timing of the transaction as well as the actual fees and expenses  we may also borrow additional amounts under our revolving credit facility 
under the terms of a commitment letter  citicorp has also agreed to provide us up to a billion senior secured bridge facility if we are unable to sell the full amount of notes required by the commitment letter 
we had previously considered assuming senior secured notes due held by jean coutu group as a component of the consideration for the acquisition 
the jean coutu group has initiated a tender offer for these notes and therefore we will not assume them 
this has increased the amount of consideration that we intend to fund by the issuance of new debt from billion to billion

under the terms of the securitization agreements  we sell substantially all of our eligible third party pharmaceutical receivables to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity spe and retain servicing responsibility 
the assets of the spe are not available to satisfy the creditors of any other person  including any of our affiliates 
these agreements provide for us to sell  and for the spe to purchase these receivables 
the spe then transfers an interest in these receivables to various cpvs 
transferred outstanding receivables cannot exceed million 
the amount of transferred receivables outstanding at any one time is dependent upon a formula that takes into account such factors as default history  obligor concentrations and potential dilution securitization formula 
adjustments to this amount can occur on a weekly basis 
at march  and march   the total of outstanding receivables that had been transferred to the cpvs were million and million  respectively

proceeds from the collections under the receivables securitization agreements are submitted to an independent trustee on a daily basis 
the trustee withholds any cash necessary to fund amounts owed to the cpvs as a result of such collections and  fund the cpvs when the securitization formula indicates a lesser amount of outstanding receivables transferred is warranted 
the remaining collections are swept to our corporate concentration account 
at march  and march   we had million and million of cash  respectively that was restricted for the payment of trustee fees 
we have determined that the transactions meet the criteria for sales treatment in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
additionally  we have determined that we do not hold a variable interest in the cpvs  pursuant to the guidance in fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  and therefore have determined that the de recognition of the transferred receivables is appropriate

cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  due to the amending of our credit facility and principal payments on long term debt 
cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  due to the amending of our credit facility and early redemption of several bonds 
capital expenditures we plan to make total capital expenditures of approximately million to million during fiscal  consisting of approximately related to new store construction  store relocation  store remodel and store improvement projects  related to the integration of brooks eckerd  related to the purchase of prescription files from independent pharmacies and related to technology enhancements  improvements to distribution centers  and other corporate requirements 
management expects that these capital expenditures will be financed primarily with cash flow from operating activities  proceeds from sale leaseback transactions and use of the revolving credit facility 
in fiscal  we intend to make capital expenditures of approximately million to million  including capital expenditures related to the integration of brooks eckerd 
in years after fiscal  capital expenditures are planned to be approximately million to million 
in fiscal  we resumed our new store and store relocation program 
in fiscal  our goal is to open or relocate approximately stores  whether or not the acquisition is consumated 
at least of the stores will be relocated or expanded stores and the remaining will be new stores 
the program is focused on our strongest existing markets 
we also expect to continue remodeling stores 
future liquidity we are highly leveraged 
our high level of indebtedness i limits our ability to obtain additional financing  ii limits our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry  iii places us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less debt  iv renders us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions  and v requires us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our debt 
in addition  the acquisition of jean coutu  usa will require us to incur approximately billion in additional debt 
based upon our current levels of operations  planned improvements in our operating performance and the opportunities that we believe the acquisition of jean coutu usa provides  we believe that cash flow from operating activities together with available borrowings under the senior secured credit facility  sales of accounts receivable under our securitization agreements  borrowings that have been committed to by our lenders related to the acquisition and other sources of liquidity will be adequate to fund the acquisition and to meet our requirements for working capital  debt service and capital expenditures including capital expenditures related to the acquisition  for the next twelve months 
we will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in light of our operating performance  funding requirements related to the acquisition and other relevant circumstances 
should we determine  at any time  that it is necessary to obtain additional short term liquidity  we will evaluate our alternatives and take appropriate steps to obtain sufficient additional funds 
the restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness in our senior secured credit facility and several of our bond indentures may limit our ability to obtain additional funds 
there can be no assurance that any such supplemental funding  if sought  could be obtained or if obtained  would be on terms acceptable to us 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
the interpretation establishes criteria for recognizing and measuring the financial statement tax effects of positions taken on a company s tax returns 
a two step process is prescribed whereby the threshold for recognition is a more likely than not test that the tax position will be sustained upon examination  based on the technical merits of the position  and the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the interpretation is effective for our fiscal year and will be applicable to all tax positions upon initial adoption 
only tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date may continue to be recognized upon adoption 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin on our consolidated financial statements 
the cumulative effect of adopting this interpretation will be recorded as a charge to retained earnings 
we do not expect that the adoption of fin will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the servicing of financial assets 
this standard is required to be adopted as of the first fiscal year beginning after september  we may be required to recognize a servicing asset or liability related to our securitization agreements 
we have not quantified the impact of adopting sfas no 
 but we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial statements or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
this standard establishes a standard definition for fair value  establishes a framework under generally accepted accounting principles for measuring fair value and expands disclosure requirements for fair value measurements 
this standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we have not yet assessed the impact  if any  of adopting sfas no 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r 
this standard requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur as a component of comprehensive income 
the standard also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end statement of financial position 
the requirement to recognize the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan is effective as of the end of the fiscal period ending after december  we have adopted this requirement and the effects are reflected in our financial position as of march  the requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer s fiscal year end statement of financial position is effective for the fiscal years ending after december  we have not yet adopted this requirement 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 

sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings 
sfas no 
does not affect any existing accounting literature that requires certain assets and liabilities to be carried at fair value 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we have not yet assessed the impact  if any  of adopting sfas no 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowance for uncollectible receivables  inventory shrink  impairment  self insurance liabilities  pension benefits  lease exit liabilities  income taxes and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current and anticipated business conditions  the condition of the financial markets and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under existing conditions 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies require the use of significant judgments and estimates by management allowance for uncollectible receivables the majority of our prescription sales are made to customers that are covered by third party payors  such as insurance companies  government agencies and employers 
we carry receivables that represent the amount owed to us for sales made to customers or employees of those payors that have not yet been paid 
we maintain a reserve for the amount of these receivables deemed to be uncollectible 
this reserve is calculated based upon historical collection activity adjusted for current conditions 
if the financial condition of the payors were to deteriorate  resulting in an inability to make payments  then an additional reserve would be recorded 
inventory included in our valuation of inventory are estimates of the losses related to shrink  which occurs during periods between physical inventory counts 
when estimating these losses  we consider historical loss results at specific locations as well as overall loss trends 
should actual shrink losses differ from the estimates that our reserves are based on  our operating results will be impacted 
impairment we evaluate long lived assets  including stores and excluding goodwill  for impairment annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may not be recoverable 
the impairment is measured by calculating the estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the store  and comparing this amount to the carrying value of the store s assets 
cash flows are calculated utilizing individual store forecasts and total company projections for the remaining estimated lease lives of the stores being analyzed 
should actual results differ from those forecasted and projected  we may incur future impairment charges related to these facilities 
goodwill impairment as disclosed in the consolidated financial statements  we have unamortized goodwill in the amount of million 
in connection with the provisions of sfas no 
 we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill 
our test as of march  resulted in no impairment being identified 
however  the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our company 
inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates  including the interpretation of economic indicators and market valuations and assumptions about our strategic plans 
to the extent that our strategic plans change  or that economic and market conditions worsen  it is possible that our conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change and result in a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
self insurance liabilities we record estimates for self insured medical  dental  workers compensation and general liability insurance coverage with assistance from actuaries 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated  or medical costs increase beyond what was anticipated  reserves recorded may not be sufficient  and additional expense may be recorded 
benefit plan accrual we have several defined benefit plans  under which participants earn a retirement benefit based upon a formula set forth in the plan 
we record expense related to these plans using actuarially determined amounts that are calculated under the provisions of sfas no 
employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of financial accounting standards board statements no 
  and r 
key assumptions used in the actuarial valuations include the discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets and the rate of increase in future compensation levels 
these rates are based on market interest rates  and therefore fluctuations in market interest rates could impact the amount of pension expense recorded for these plans 
the accumulated benefit obligation of the defined benefit plans is a discounted amount calculated using the discount rate from published high quality long term bond indices  the terms of which approximate the term of the cash flows to pay the accumulated benefit obligations when due 
an increase in the market interest rates  assuming no other changes in the estimates  reduces the amount of the accumulated benefit obligation and the related required expense 
lease exit liabilities we record reserves for closed stores based on future lease commitments  that are present valued at current risk free interest rates  anticipated ancillary occupancy costs  and anticipated future subleases of properties 
if interest rates or the real estate leasing markets change  reserves may be increased or decreased 
income taxes we currently have net operating loss nol carryforwards that can be utilized to offset future income for federal and state tax purposes 
these nols generate a significant deferred tax asset 
we regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability considering our historical profitability  projected taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies 
we will establish a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax provision in the period of change 
significant judgment is required in making these assessments 
litigation reserves we are involved in litigation on an on going basis 
we accrue our best estimate of the probable loss related to legal claims 
such estimates are developed in consultation with in house and outside counsel  and are based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
to the extent additional information arises or our strategies change  it is possible that our best estimate of the probable liability may also change 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our future earnings  cash flow and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market rates 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates 
increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense 
we enter into debt obligations to support capital expenditures  acquisitions  working capital needs and general corporate purposes 
our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of variable rate credit facilities  fixed rate long term obligations and derivative transactions 
the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal payments and the related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates as of march  thereafter total fair value at march  long term debt  including current portion fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate our ability to satisfy our interest payment obligations on our outstanding debt will depend largely on our future performance  which  in turn  is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors beyond our control 
if we do not have sufficient cash flow to service our interest payment obligations on our outstanding indebtedness and if we cannot borrow or obtain equity financing to satisfy those obligations  our business and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
we cannot be assured that any replacement borrowing or equity financing could be successfully completed 
the interest rate on the variable rate borrowings on this facility are libor plus for the revolving credit facility 
changes in one month libor affect our cost of borrowings because the interest rate on our variable rate obligations is based on libor 
if the market rates of interest for one month libor change by approximately basis points as compared to the libor rate of as of march  our annual interest expense would change by approximately million based upon our variable rate debt outstanding of approximately million on march  a change in interest rates generally does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixed rate debt instruments
