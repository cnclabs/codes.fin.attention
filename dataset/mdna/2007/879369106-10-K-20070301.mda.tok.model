item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are focused on achieving consistent and sustainable growth through the continued development of our core businesses and carefully selected acquisitions 
our internal growth initiatives include the development of new products  moving existing products into market adjacencies in which we already participate with other products and the expansion of market share 
our core revenue growth in as compared to  excluding the impacts of currency  acquisitions and divestitures  was 
core growth was strongest in our aerospace segment  which grew  and weakest in our medical segment  which grew year over year 
segment operating profit increased in due primarily to cost and productivity improvements in our aerospace and medical segments  offset  in part  by a decline in our commercial segment margins 
on july   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our outstanding common stock over twelve months ended july in june  our board of directors extended for an additional six months  until january  its authorization for the repurchase of shares 
under the approved plan  we repurchased a total of  shares on the open market during and for an aggregate purchase price of million  and aggregate fees and commissions of million  with  shares repurchased during for an aggregate purchase price of million  and aggregate fees and commissions of million 
in november  we acquired taut  inc  or taut  a producer of instruments and devices for minimally invasive surgical procedures  particularly laparoscopic surgery  for million 
the results for taut are included in our medical segment 
also in november  we acquired ecotrans technologies  inc  or ecotrans  a leading supplier of locomotive anti idling and emissions reduction solutions for the railroad industry  for million 
the results for ecotrans are included in our commercial segment 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 

table of contents we have identified the following as critical accounting estimates  which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
inventory utilization inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
inherent in this valuation are significant management judgments and estimates concerning excess inventory and obsolescence rates 
based upon these judgments and estimates  we record a reserve to adjust the carrying amount of our inventories 
we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities 
in assessing historical usage  we also qualitatively assess business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage 
our inventory reserve was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
accounting for long lived assets and investments the ability to realize long lived assets is evaluated periodically as events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover their carrying amount 
such evaluation is based on various analyses  including undiscounted cash flow projections 
the analyses necessarily involve significant management judgment 
any impairment loss  if indicated  is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 we perform an annual impairment test of our recorded goodwill 
in addition  we test our other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
these impairment tests can be significantly altered by estimates of future performance  long term discount rates and market price valuation multiples 
these estimates will likely change over time 
many of our businesses operate in cyclical industries and the valuation of these businesses can be expected to fluctuate as a result of this cyclicality 
goodwill and other intangible assets totaled million and million at december  and december   respectively 
accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits we provide a range of benefits to eligible employees and retired employees  including pensions and postretirement healthcare 
several statistical and other factors which are designed to project future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to these plans 
these factors include actuarial assumptions about discount rates  expected rates of return on plan assets  compensation increases  turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates 
we review the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense 
a basis point increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased the total net periodic pension and postretirement healthcare expense for by approximately million and would have decreased the projected benefit obligation at december  by approximately million 
a basis point decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased these amounts by approximately million and million  respectively 
a basis point change in the expected return on plan assets would have impacted annual pension expense by approximately million 
a increase in the assumed healthcare trend rate would have increased the benefit expense by approximately million and would have increased the projected benefit obligation by approximately million 
a decrease in the assumed healthcare trend rate would have decreased the 
table of contents benefit expense by approximately million and would have decreased the projected benefit obligation by approximately million 
accounting for restructuring costs restructuring costs  which include termination benefits  contract termination costs and other restructuring costs  are recorded at estimated fair value 
key assumptions in calculating the restructuring costs include the terms that may be negotiated to exit certain contractual obligations and the timing of employees leaving the company 
accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for which the collection of the full amount of accounts receivable is doubtful 
the allowance is based on our historical experience  the period an account is outstanding  the financial position of the customer and information provided by credit rating services 
we review the allowance periodically and adjust it as necessary 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was million at both december  and december  product warranty liability most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of the sales 
we estimate our warranty costs and liability based on a number of factors including historical trends of units sold  the status of existing claims  recall programs and communication with customers 
our estimated product warranty liability was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
accounting for income taxes our annual provision for income taxes and determination of the deferred tax assets and liabilities require management to assess uncertainties  make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates 
we conduct a broad range of operations around the world  subjecting us to complex tax regulations in numerous international taxing jurisdictions  resulting at times in tax audits  disputes and potentially litigation  the outcome of which is uncertain 
management must make judgments about such uncertainties and determine estimates of our tax assets and liabilities 
to the extent the final outcome differs  future adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities will be necessary 
our income taxes payable was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
we are also required to assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets  taking into consideration our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets 
based on this assessment  management must evaluate the need for  and amount of  valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets 
to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future  adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required 
accounting standards issued not yet adopted in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued interpretation  or fin  no

additional information regarding stock based compensation and our stock compensation plans is presented in notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
in june  we began certain restructuring initiatives that affect all three of our operating segments 
these initiatives involve the consolidation of operations and a related reduction in workforce at several of our facilities in europe and north america 
we have determined to undertake these initiatives as a means to improving operating performance and to better leverage our existing resources 
the charges associated with the restructuring program that are included in restructuring and impairment charges during totaled million  of which  and were attributable to our commercial  medical and aerospace segments  respectively 
as of december   we expect to incur future restructuring costs associated with our restructuring program of between million and million in our commercial  medical and aerospace segments over the next two quarters 
during the first quarter of  we began a restructuring activity in our aerospace segment 
the actions relate to the closure of a manufacturing facility  termination of employees and relocation of operations 
the charges associated with this activity that are included in restructuring and impairment charges during totaled million 
we do not expect to incur future restructuring costs associated with this activity 
during the fourth quarter of  we announced and commenced implementation of a restructuring and divestiture program designed to improve future operating performance and position us for future earnings growth 
the actions have included exiting or divesting non core or low performing businesses  consolidating manufacturing operations and reorganizing administrative functions to enable businesses to share services 
the charges  including changes in estimates  associated with the restructuring and divestiture program for continuing operations that are included in restructuring and impairment charges during  and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
the million was attributable to our medical segment

of the million   and were attributable to our commercial  medical and aerospace segments  respectively 
as of december   we expect to incur future restructuring costs associated with our restructuring and divestiture program of between million and million in our medical segment during certain costs associated with the restructuring and divestiture program are not included in restructuring and impairment charges 
all inventory adjustments that resulted from the restructuring and divestiture program and certain other costs associated with closing out businesses during and are included in materials  labor and other product costs and totaled million and million  respectively 
the million in costs for related to our aerospace segment 
of the million in costs for  million and million were attributed to our commercial and aerospace segments  respectively 

table of contents the cost savings from our restructuring programs were lower than expected in due primarily to implementation inefficiencies in our medical segment during the first half of the year  but we began to experience our anticipated rate of savings during the second half of the year 
for a more complete discussion of our restructuring programs  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
we performed an annual impairment test of our recorded goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of and determined that a portion of our goodwill was impaired 
we recorded a charge of million  which is included in restructuring and impairment charges 
also during  we determined that three minority held investments and certain fixed assets were impaired and recorded an aggregate charge of million  which is included in restructuring and impairment charges 
comparison of and revenues increased in to billion from billion in this increase was due to increases of from core growth and from acquisitions  offset  in part  by decreases of from dispositions and from the impact of eliminating the one month reporting lag in for certain of our foreign operations 
the commercial  medical and aerospace segments comprised  and of our revenues  respectively 
materials  labor and other product costs as a percentage of revenues increased to in compared with in due primarily to the impact of duplicate costs and inefficiencies related to the transfer of products between facilities in the commercial segment associated with the restructuring program 
selling  engineering and administrative expenses operating expenses as a percentage of revenues declined to in compared with in due primarily to the continuing reduction of facilities and supporting infrastructure costs and decreased corporate expenses relative to higher revenues 
interest expense increased in principally from higher acquisition related debt balances in the first half of interest income increased in primarily due to higher average cash balances  related to increased proceeds received from sales of businesses and assets in the effective income tax rate was in compared with in the higher rate in was primarily the result of the increase in foreign earnings for businesses located in higher taxed jurisdictions 
minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries increased million in due to increased profits from our entities that are not wholly owned 
net income for was million  an increase of million from  due primarily to a decrease in restructuring costs and to the gain on the sale of the sermatech business 
diluted earnings per share increased to  and includes the net gain on sales of businesses and assets and the cost of restructuring and discontinued operations 
segment reviews the following is a discussion of our segment operating results 
additional information regarding our segments is presented in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
commercial products in the commercial segment are manufactured for broad distribution as well as custom fabricated to meet individual customer needs 
consumer spending patterns influence the market trends for products sold to the automotive  marine and certain power equipment markets 
automotive cable and shifter products are manufactured primarily for automotive oems 
discussion of marine and industrial product lines below includes the manufacturing and distribution of driver controls  
table of contents motion controls  power and vehicle management systems and fuel management systems to the automotive supply  marine and industrial markets 
comparison of and commercial segment revenues increased in to billion from billion in  principally due to core growth 
the segment benefited from increased sales in of alternative fuel systems and auxiliary power systems and sales of heavy duty rigging and cable used in marine construction and the securing of oil platforms  offset  in part  by lower volume and customer price reductions for automotive products 
commercial segment operating profit declined in to million from million in operating profit improvements resulting from sales of auxiliary power units and other higher margin industrial products were more than offset by costs associated with the end of certain automotive programs  mix and margin pressure associated with lower volume and customer price reductions for automotive products coupled with increases in commodity pricing 
operating profit as a percent of revenues declined to in from in assets in the commercial segment declined million or  primarily due to the decrease in net property  plant and equipment and accounts receivable  offset  in part  by the impact of currency 
comparison of and commercial segment revenues declined in to billion from billion in the segment generated an increase of from core growth that was more than offset by a decrease from dispositions 
the segment benefited from strength in its industrial oem markets  the contribution of new driver controls and power and vehicle management system products and increased sales of driver and motion controls to automotive oem markets 
these benefits were more than offset by slower sales of products into marine and recreational markets 
commercial segment operating profit declined in to million from million in this decline primarily reflects lower volume related contributions from higher margin marine and recreational products  the impact of duplicate costs and inefficiencies related to the transfer of products between two tier automotive supply facilities  the bankruptcy of an automotive supply customer and the impact of divestitures made in operating profit as a percent of revenues declined to in from in assets in the commercial segment declined million or  primarily due to the decrease in non current deferred tax assets and net property  plant and equipment and the impact of currency 
medical products in the medical segment generally are required to meet exacting standards of performance and have long product life cycles 
economic influences on revenues relate primarily to spending patterns in the worldwide medical devices and hospital supply market 
comparison of and medical segment revenues increased in to million from million in  principally due to core growth 
the segment benefited from sales of new products in respiratory care and sleep therapy  including distribution of products through alliances with other manufacturers  and continued growth of diagnostic and therapeutic device products sold to medical device manufacturers  offset by a decline in sales of orthopedic specialty devices sold to medical device manufacturers 
medical segment operating profit increased in to million from million in this increase primarily reflects cost and productivity improvements in the second half of the year  following 
table of contents completion of significant restructuring activities 
during the first half of  operating profit was negatively impacted by costs associated with operational inefficiencies and the consolidation of facilities and distribution centers 
we also incurred significant costs as planned in connection with the initial phases of an information systems implementation program during the first half of operating profit as a percent of revenues increased to in from in assets in the medical segment declined million or  primarily due to the decrease in accounts receivable  deferred tax assets and net property  plant and equipment  offset  in part  by the impact of the taut acquisition and the impact of currency 
comparison of and medical segment revenues increased in to million from million in this increase was due to increases of from acquisitions and from core growth  offset  in part  by decreases of from the impact of eliminating the one month reporting lag in for certain of our foreign operations and from dispositions 
medical segment revenues increased primarily as a result of the increased sale of disposable medical products  particularly related to the third quarter acquisition of hudsonrci  a provider of respiratory care products 
sales of surgical instruments and medical devices increased primarily as a result of new product sales and volume increases for specialty devices sold to medical device manufacturers 
medical segment operating profit increased in to million from million in driven primarily by the hudsonrci acquisition and significant improvements in the core business as benefits of the restructuring program began to be recognized 
operating profit as a percent of revenues increased to in from in assets in the medical segment declined million or  primarily due to the decrease in accounts receivable  including the sale of certain receivables under a non recourse securitization program  the decrease in non current deferred tax assets and the impact of currency 
aerospace products and services in the aerospace segment  many of which are proprietary  require a high degree of engineering sophistication and are often custom designed 
economic influences on these products and services relate primarily to spending patterns in the worldwide aerospace industry and the demand for additional air cargo capacity 
comparison of and aerospace segment revenues increased in to million from million in this increase was due to increases of from core growth and from acquisitions 
core growth in wide body cargo handling systems  repair services and precision machined components was partially offset by the million decrease in revenues resulting from the phase out of our industrial gas turbine aftermarket services business in aerospace segment operating profit increased to million from million in volume related efficiencies  additional higher margin cargo spares sales and mix within our precision machined components business contributed to the improvement as did a reduction in losses resulting from the exit of the industrial gas turbine aftermarket services business 
operating profit as a percent of revenues increased to in from in assets in the aerospace segment increased million or  primarily due to the impact of currency 

table of contents comparison of and aerospace segment revenues increased in to million from million in strong core growth in repair products and services and in sales of both narrow body cargo loading systems and wide body cargo system conversions  along with an increase due to a small acquisition in  was partially offset by the impact of eliminating the one month reporting lag in for certain of our foreign operations and by the phase out and closure of industrial gas turbine aftermarket services 
aerospace segment operating profit increased to a profit of million in from a loss of million in  an improvement of million 
higher volume and improvements in precision machined components and the cargo systems businesses contributed to the increase as did a reduction in losses resulting from the exit of the industrial gas turbine aftermarket services 
operating profit loss as a percent of revenues was in versus in assets in the aerospace segment declined million or  primarily due to the impact of the sale of the sermatech international business 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities from continuing operations provided net cash of million during changes in our operating assets and liabilities during resulted in a net cash inflow of million 
the most significant change was a decrease in accounts receivable  which was primarily due to improved cash collection 
our financing activities from continuing operations during consisted primarily of purchases of shares of our common stock of million  a decrease in notes payable and current borrowings of million  a reduction in long term borrowings of million and payment of dividends of million 
our investing activities from continuing operations during consisted primarily of capital expenditures of million and payments for businesses acquired of million  including a million deferred payment related to a prior period acquisition 
during  we also had proceeds from the sale of businesses and assets of million and made a million payment in connection with a post closing purchase price adjustment based on working capital for a divested business 
we had net cash provided by discontinued operations of million in operating activities from continuing operations provided net cash of approximately million during changes in our operating assets and liabilities during resulted in a net cash inflow of million 
the most significant change was a decrease in accounts receivable  which was primarily due to improved cash collection including the sale of certain receivables under a non recourse securitization program 
our financing activities during consisted primarily of a reduction in long term borrowings of million and proceeds from long term borrowings of million  as a result of improved operating cash flow  the repatriation of foreign earnings  proceeds from the disposition of businesses and lower capital spending 
during  we also paid dividends to minority interest shareholders of million and made purchases of shares of our common stock of million 
our investing activities during consisted primarily of proceeds from the sale of businesses and assets of million 
during  we also had capital expenditures of million 
we had net cash used in discontinued operations of million in operating activities from continuing operations provided net cash of approximately million during changes in our operating assets and liabilities during resulted in a net cash inflow of million 
the most significant changes were an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a decrease in inventories  offset  in part  by an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in income taxes payable 
the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses was due primarily to increased accruals associated with the restructuring and divestiture program 
the decrease in inventories was the result of our focus on improved working capital management 
the increase in accounts receivable was largely a result of increased business levels and the hudsonrci acquisition 
the decrease in income taxes payable was a result of tax deductions associated with the restructuring and divestiture program  for which the cash benefits were received in 
table of contents our financing activities during consisted primarily of the receipt of million in gross proceeds from long term borrowings  primarily for the acquisition of hudsonrci 
this amount is offset by a decrease in notes payable and current borrowings of million and a reduction in long term borrowings of million  driven by improved operating cash flow  proceeds from the disposition of businesses and lower year over year capital spending 
our investing activities during consisted primarily of payments for businesses acquired of million 
we had net cash provided by discontinued operations of million in we use an accounts receivable securitization program to gain access to enhanced credit markets and reduce financing costs 
as currently structured  we sell certain trade receivables on a non recourse basis to a consolidated special purpose entity  which in turn sells an interest in those receivables to a commercial paper conduit 
the conduit issues notes secured by that interest to third party investors 
the assets of the special purpose entity are not available to satisfy our obligations 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  transfers of assets under the program qualify as sales of receivables and accordingly  million of accounts receivable and the related amounts previously recorded in notes payable were removed from the consolidated balance sheet as of both december  and december  on july   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our outstanding common stock over twelve months ended july in june  our board of directors extended for an additional six months  until january  its authorization for the repurchase of shares 
under the approved plan  we repurchased a total of  shares on the open market during and for an aggregate purchase price of million  and aggregate fees and commissions of million  with  shares repurchased during for an aggregate purchase price of million  and aggregate fees and commissions of million 
the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of million and million at december  and december   respectively  relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets  primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions 
we believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax asset 
the valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that a valuation allowance be established and maintained when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the valuation allowance increase in was primarily attributable to the recording of deferred tax assets associated with state tax loss carryforwards at full value which required a valuation allowance 
in addition to the cash generated from operations  we have approximately million in committed and million in uncommitted unused lines of credit available 
the availability of the lines of credit is dependent upon us maintaining our financial condition including our continued compliance with bank covenants 
various senior and term note agreements provide for the maintenance of certain financial ratios and limit the repurchase of our stock and payment of cash dividends 
under the most restrictive of these provisions  million of retained earnings was available for dividends and stock repurchases at december  on february   the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of per share on our common stock  which is payable on march  to holders of record on march  as of february   we had approximately holders of record of our common stock 
fixed rate borrowings  excluding the effect of derivative instruments  comprised of total borrowings at december  approximately of our total borrowings of million are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the euro  which we believe provides a natural hedge against fluctuations in the value of assets outside the united states 
during the fourth quarter of  in order to take advantage of the provisions of the ajca  management executed a foreign earnings repatriation plan 
under this plan  we repatriated million of dividends during november and december

we believe that our cash flow from operations and our ability to access additional funds through credit facilities will enable us to fund our operating requirements  capital expenditures and additional acquisition opportunities 
contractual obligations at december  are as follows payments due by period less more than than total year years years years dollars in millions long term borrowings interest obligations operating lease obligations minimum purchase obligations total contractual obligations purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable pricing provisions and the approximate timing of the transactions 
these obligations relate primarily to material purchase requirements 
we also have obligations with respect to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
off balance sheet arrangements we have residual value guarantees under operating leases for plant and equipment 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these guarantees is approximately million 
we use an accounts receivable securitization program to gain access to enhanced credit markets and reduce financing costs 
as currently structured  we sell certain trade receivables on a non recourse basis to a

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to certain financial risks  specifically fluctuations in market interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and  to a lesser extent  commodity prices 
we use derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact of some of these risks 
all instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes 
we are also exposed to changes in the market traded price of our common stock as it influences the valuation of stock options and their effect on earnings 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowing activities and our cash balances 
interest rate swaps are used to manage a portion of our interest rate risk 
the table below is an analysis of the amortization and related interest rates by year of maturity for our fixed and variable rate debt obligations 
variable interest rates shown below are weighted average rates of the debt portfolio 
for the swaps  notional amounts and related interest rates are shown by year of maturity 
the fair value of the interest rate swaps as of december  was million 
year of maturity thereafter total dollars in thousands fixed rate debt average interest rate variable rate debt average interest rate amount subject to swaps variable to fixed average rate to be received average rate to be paid a increase or decrease in variable interest rates would adversely or positively impact our expected net earnings by approximately million or million  respectively 
foreign currency risk we are exposed to fluctuations in market values of transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries 
we have entered into forward contracts with several major financial institutions to hedge a portion of projected cash flows from these exposures 
the fair value of the open forward contracts as of december  was million
