overview state auto financial is a property and casualty insurance holding company primarily engaged in writing both personal and business lines of insurance 
the state auto group writes a broad line of property and casualty insurance products through approximately  agencies in states

state auto mutual is one of only companies in the united states to have been rated a superior or higher by am best company every year since state auto mutual s subsidiaries and affiliates are sa florida and sa wisconsin  each of which is a property and casualty insurance company  migi  an insurance holding company  meridian security  a property and casualty insurance company  and meridian citizens mutual  a mutual property and casualty insurance company 
meridian security and meridian citizens mutual are collectively referred to as the migi insurers and  together with migi  the migi companies 
the pooled companies provide a broad line of property and casualty insurance  such as standard personal and commercial automobile  homeowners and farmowners  commercial multi peril  workers compensation  general liability and property insurance 
sa national provides nonstandard personal automobile insurance to the nonstandard insurance market 
our pooled companies and sa national are rated a superior by the am best company 
the stfc pooled companies participate in a quota share reinsurance pooling arrangement the pooling arrangement with the mutual pooled companies 
the pooling arrangement covers all the property and casualty insurance written by the pooled companies except voluntary assumed reinsurance written by state auto mutual  state auto middle market insurance as defined in the current pooling agreement among the pooled companies and intercompany catastrophe reinsurance written by state auto p c 
under the pooling arrangement  each of the pooled companies cedes premiums  losses and expenses on all of its business to state auto mutual  and state auto mutual in turn cedes to each of the pooled companies a specified portion of premiums  losses and expenses based on each of the pooled companies respective pooling percentages 
state auto mutual then retains the balance of the pooled business 
the participation percentage for the stfc pooled companies has remained at since october  as of january   the pooling arrangement was amended to add the migi insurers as participants 
in conjunction with this amendment  the stfc pooled companies received million in cash from the migi insurers which related to the additional net insurance liabilities assumed on january  
table of contents the following table sets forth a chronology of the participant and participation percentage changes that have occurred in the pooling arrangement since january  stfc pooled companies mutual pooled companies year state auto p c milbank farmers sa ohio sub total state auto mutual sa wisconsin sa florida meridian security meridian citizens mutual sub total n a n a time period is for the year ended december prior to january   we operated in two significant reportable segments 
state auto p c  milbank  farmers and sa ohio comprised the standard segment of our operations  and sa national comprised the nonstandard segment 
under the leadership of robert p 
restrepo  jr  as our new chairman  president and chief executive officer  became a transitional year for the state auto group as we undertook initiatives to realign our internal organization  specifically our people  processes  internal reporting systems and compensation reward programs  to become more focused within the business and personal insurance markets 
while will continue to be a transitional year in certain areas of our company  we have now established integrated personal and business insurance teams with product  profit and production responsibilities for their respective areas 
as a result of these transitional efforts  beginning in  our significant reportable segments will be personal and business insurance along with a third segment for investment operations  and we will begin reporting on these bases to our chief operating decision makers 
financial information about our segments for is set forth in note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of the form k 
executive summary the results of our operations from year to year and quarter to quarter are primarily driven by our ability to generate revenue through selecting and pricing risks in a manner that permits premium growth without adversely affecting underwriting profits  and disciplined investment strategy 
we also recognize that our results will be periodically impacted  sometimes significantly  by the occurrence of catastrophic events  which are generally beyond our control 
premium growth underwriting profitability the property and casualty insurance industry is highly cyclical 
our industry has been historically characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excess underwriting capacity  as well as periods of shortages of underwriting capacity that result in increased prices and more favorable underwriting terms 
during periods of excess underwriting capacity  some property and casualty insurers attempt to generate additional top line growth by setting their prices at levels inappropriate for the risk underwritten 
while in the short term this may result in additional revenues  this action compromises their long term underwriting profitability 
our strategy is to adhere to disciplined and consistent underwriting principles 
these principles include insistence on selecting and retaining business based on the merits of each account and a dedication to cost based pricing  where each line of business is priced to generate a profit 
it is our intention to set pricing levels so that no line of business  or classification within major lines  subsidizes another line or classification 
we are committed to achieving our goal of a combined ratio of or better through all market cycles  even at the expense of periodic slowdowns in written and earned premiums 
we will not compromise underwriting profitability for top line growth 
we believe that we can implement periodic rate changes in most states and remain an attractive market to our policyholders and independent agency partners by stressing the strengths we bring to the marketplace 
these strengths include stability  financial soundness  prompt and fair claims service  and technology which makes it easier for the agent to do business with the state auto group and provide substantial value to our customers 
investment strategy we have a disciplined approach to our investment strategy that emphasizes the quality of our fixed income portfolio  which comprised of our total portfolio at fair value at 
table of contents december   and includes only investment grade securities 
our equity portfolio  which comprised approximately at fair value of our total portfolio at december   emphasizes large capitalization  dividend paying companies 
we select equity investments based on a stock s potential for appreciation as well as ability to continue paying dividends 
loss reserves we maintain reserves for the eventual payment of losses and loss expenses for both reported claims and incurred claims that have not yet been reported 
loss reserves are management s best estimates at a given point in time of what we expect to pay to claimants  based on facts  circumstances and historical trends then known 
although management uses many resources to calculate reserves  there is no precise method for determining the ultimate liability 
we do not discount loss reserves for financial statement purposes 
our objective is to set reserves that are adequate such that the amounts that we originally record as reserves reasonably approximate the ultimate liability for insured losses and loss expenses 
we then periodically review and adjust loss reserves on a timely basis 
this ongoing periodic review assures a consistent level of adequacy and also minimizes the impact that any required adjustment may have on our current operating results 
catastrophic events we are exposed to claims arising out of catastrophic events 
catastrophe losses can and do cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year 
catastrophes can be caused by various natural events  including hurricanes  hailstorms  tornadoes  windstorms  earthquakes  severe winter weather and fires  none of which are within our control 
the frequency and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable 
the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event 
many catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas 
however  hurricanes  earthquakes and other perils may produce significant damage in larger areas  especially those that are heavily populated 
although catastrophes can cause losses in a variety of our property and casualty lines  most of our catastrophe claims in the past have related to homeowners  other personal lines  allied lines and commercial multiple peril coverages 
we deploy specific strategies designed to mitigate our exposure to catastrophe losses  which include obtaining reinsurance 
we continually seek to diversify our business on a geographic basis 
the number of states we operate in has increased from states in to states in in early  we began writing personal insurance in the state of colorado  our th state of operation 
the concentration of gross written premiums for our property and casualty operations in our largest state  ohio  has decreased from for the year ended december   to for the year ended december  we carefully monitor writing insurance in states that we believe present difficult legislative  judicial and or regulatory environments for the insurance industry 
our underwriting guidelines are designed to limit exposures for high risk insurance matters such as asbestos and environmental claims 
our catastrophe management strategies are designed to mitigate our exposure to earthquakes and hurricanes 
in addition to our adherence to our cost based pricing  investment and risk mitigation strategies  discussed above  our management focuses on several other key areas with the intention of continually improving the results of our operations and financial results  including the following claims service we believe an important element of our success is our focus on claims service 
we expect our claim service to be fair  fast and friendly 
the role of the claims division is to deliver the promise that we and the independent agent made to the insured 
we have the capability of receiving claims hours a day  seven days a week 
claims may be reported to our claims contact center  to the policyholder s independent agent or via the internet 
we make a pledge to our policyholders to try and make contact with them within two hours of a claim being assigned to a claims handler except in catastrophe loss situations 
independent insurance agent network we offer our products through approximately  agencies in states 
we believe the success of our independent insurance agent network  which is our only distribution channel  grows out of our commitment to promote and foster close working relationships with our agents 
we seek relationships with agencies where we will be one of their top three insurers  
table of contents measured on the basis of direct premiums written  for the type of business we desire 
our agents compensation package includes competitive commission rates and other sales inducements designed to maintain and enhance relationships with existing independent agents as well as to attract new independent agents 
we provide our agents with a co operative advertising program  sales training programs  an agent s stock purchase program  profit sharing and travel incentives and agency recognition 
we continually monitor our agencies for compatibility with us  taking into account factors such as loss ratio  premium volume  business profiles and relationship history 
this allows us to be proactive in helping the agents to enhance profitability and  thus  maintain the advantages of the state auto agency relationship 
our senior management regularly makes themselves available to the agency force to reinforce this partnership commitment 
we believe each of these elements creates a relationship that has resulted in our independent insurance agents placing quality insurance business with us 
technology our internet based point of sale agency portal for personal lines business  netxpress  and an automated intelligent underwriting system  apollo  are examples of standards based  user friendly technology which improves the agents ease of doing business with us 
statistics for indicate that up from in of our personal automobile and homeowners new business applications were delivered to us electronically 
this resulted in an additional  policies being sent to us electronically in over in regards to policy change requests  were processed electronically by our agents in compared to in this represents  more policy changes done electronically by agents in over the apollo system allows us to be better able to make consistent underwriting decisions across personal auto and homeowners products 
in  we expanded the use of this system to additional states  additional products  and added the automated review of claims transactions 
in  more than  transactions new business  endorsements  cancellations  and claims transactions were reviewed by apollo 
of those   of them were automatically accepted by business rules established within apollo 
management continued to focus in on improving our ease of doing business in other ways as well  such as enhancements to our electronic portal for agents  called agentsite  and creating ways for our internet rating and underwriting systems to talk with more agency management systems and third party application tools that our agents use 
we added two new underwriting tools in our youthful driver identification tool  which works to identify youthful operators at the earliest possible point without the need to rely on agents or policyholders  is now being used in nine of our nonstandard personal automobile insurance states and of our standard personal automobile insurance states 
youthful operators  as inexperienced drivers  tend to produce a disproportionate number of losses 
our ability to identify these drivers early and charge the appropriate premium should improve our profitability on these accounts 
we also introduced a property protection class tool in states 
this tool verifies the accuracy of the fire protection class for a given risk which will assist in providing more appropriate underwriting 
the agentsite dashboard was enhanced to provide agents with even quicker access to customer information and their recent transactions 
this new functionality has helped agents transition following our decision to eliminate the printing and mailing of paper policy declarations to agents for personal insurance 
in  we upgraded our enterprise billing and claims systems 
both of these applications now utilize browser based technology which replaced older  hard to maintain technology 
we also increased the methods by which insureds can make premium payments 
insureds can now pay online via our website portal and by credit and debit cards 
all of these methods have resulted in increased flexibility and more satisfied customers 
we also now receive nearly of our new claims via our website portal 
in  we began work to develop business insurance automation systems that are intended to build upon the success we have achieved through our netxpress system for personal insurance 
we 
table of contents modernized our business insurance policy administration system to allow straight through processing which now results in a real time update capability 
in order to achieve our goal of commercial lines functionality equivalent to that provided by netxpress in personal insurance  we are making necessary and appropriate investments in people and systems 
we believe developing such an internet based system is vitally important to our ability to compete for new business insurance accounts 
the goal is to enable agents to offer a firm quote to a customer in real time at the point of sale for three of our major business insurance products 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet  revenues and expenses for the period then ended and the financial entries in the accompanying notes to the financial statements 
such estimates and assumptions could change in the future  as more information becomes known which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed therein 
we have identified the policies and estimates described below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of the results of our operations 
investments fixed maturity and equity security investments are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value 
the unrealized holding gains or losses  net of applicable deferred taxes  are shown as a separate component of stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income  and as such are not included in the determination of net income 
investment income is recognized when earned  and capital gains and losses are recognized when investments are sold 
we regularly monitor our investment portfolio for declines in value that are other than temporary  an assessment that requires significant management judgment 
among the factors management considers are the nature of the investment  severity and length of decline in fair value  events impacting the issuer  overall market conditions and its intent and ability to hold securities until the value recovers 
when a security in our investment portfolio has been determined to have a decline in fair value that is other than temporary  we adjust the cost basis of the security to fair value 
this results in a charge to earnings as a realized loss  which is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value 
for a further discussion regarding our investments see other investments included herein 
deferred acquisition costs acquisition costs  consisting of commissions  premium taxes and certain underwriting expenses relating to the production of property and casualty business  are deferred and amortized over the same period in which the related premiums are earned 
the method followed for computing the acquisition costs limits the amount of such deferred costs to their estimated realizable value 
in determining estimated realizable value  the computation gives effect to the premium to be earned  related investment income  losses and loss expenses expected to be incurred  and certain other costs expected to be incurred as premium is earned 
these amounts are based on estimates  and accordingly  the actual realizable value may vary from the estimated realizable value 
losses and loss expenses payable losses and loss expenses payable are management s best estimates at a given point in time of what we expect to pay claimants  based on known facts  circumstances and historical trends 
reserves for reported losses are established on either a case by case or formula basis depending on the type and circumstances of the loss 
the case by case reserve amounts are determined by claims adjusters based on our reserving practices  which 
table of contents take into account the type of risk  the circumstances surrounding each claim and policy provisions relating to types of loss 
the formula reserves are based on historical data for similar claims with provision for trend changes caused by inflation 
case and formula basis loss reserves are reviewed on a regular basis  and as new data becomes available  estimates are updated resulting in adjustments to loss reserves 
generally  reported losses initially reserved on a formula basis and not settled after six months are case reserved at that time 
loss and loss expense reserves for incurred claims that have not yet been reported ibnr are estimated based on many variables including historical and statistical information  inflation  legal developments  storm loss estimates  and economic conditions 
the process for calculating ibnr is to develop an estimate of the ultimate losses incurred  and then subtract all amounts already paid or held in tabular case reserves 
although management uses many internal and external resources  as well as multiple established methodologies to calculate ibnr  there is no method for determining the exact ultimate liability 
see further discussion regarding our losses and loss expense reserves and our reserving methods see other loss and loss expense reserves included herein 
pension and postretirement benefit obligations pension and postretirement benefit obligations are long term in nature and require management s judgment in estimating the factors used to determine these amounts 
management reviews these factors annually  including the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
because these obligations are based on management estimates which could change  the ultimate benefit obligation could be different from the amount estimated 
for a further discussion regarding our pension and postretirement benefit obligations see other employee benefit plans included herein 
share based compensation we have share based compensation plans which authorize the granting of various equity based incentives including stock options  restricted stock and restricted share units to employees and non employee directors and agents 
the expense for these equity based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant or each reporting date and amortized over their vesting period 
the fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant or each reporting date using the black scholes closed form pricing model 
the pricing model requires assumptions such as the expected life of the option and expected volatility of our stock over the expected life of the option  which significantly impacts the assumed fair value 
we use historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants  share based compensation expense will fluctuate in future periods 
for a discussion regarding our adoption of sfas r  share based payment sfas r  effective january   see compared to expenses included herein 
other other items that could have a significant impact on the financial statements include the risks and uncertainties listed in item a of this form k under risk factors 
actual results could differ materially using different estimates and assumptions  or if conditions are significantly different in the future

a critical measure of a successful property and casualty insurance company is whether or not it consistently produces an underwriting profit during all market cycles 
when underwriting is not profitable  insurance losses and related acquisition and operating expenses exceed premiums 
sustained underwriting losses can place an insurer at greater risk of insolvency than an insurer which is consistently profitable from an underwriting standpoint 
we have consistently focused on producing an underwriting profit and  therefore  we view our underwriting results during all market cycles as the most important measure of our overall operating performance 

table of contents we monitor the performance of our insurance segments by concentrating on segment underwriting profit and combined ratio 
underwriting profit under statutory accounting principles sap is determined by subtracting from earned premiums  losses and loss expenses and net underwriting expenses incurred 
sap requires all underwriting expenses to be expensed immediately and not deferred over the same period that the premium is earned 
us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  however  require the recognition of acquisition costs as the premiums are earned 
in converting sap underwriting results to gaap underwriting results  acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the periods the related written premiums are earned 
for a discussion of deferred policy acquisition costs see critical accounting policies deferred acquisition costs included herein 
the gaap combined ratio is defined as the sum of the gaap loss and lae ratio loss and loss expenses  as a percentage of earned premiums plus gaap expense ratio acquisition and operating expenses  as a percentage of earned premiums 
when the combined ratio is less than  the insurer is operating at an underwriting profit 
when the combined ratio is greater than  the insurer is operating at an underwriting loss

table of contents written premiums are recognized as earned based upon the contract terms of the underlying policies 
the unearned premium represents the deferred revenues of the unexpired terms of coverage which are earned ratably over the policy period 
during each of the three years ended december   our insurance segments attained an underwriting profit while also incurring significant levels of catastrophe losses in terms of dollars 
despite these catastrophe losses  our core results remained strong which was the direct result of our maintaining adequate cost based rates and monitoring risk selection 
compared to income before federal income taxes decreased million to million in from the most significant factors contributing to this decrease relate to a decline in our revenues  specifically our premiums  an increased level of catastrophe losses  and the recognition of share based compensation expenses beginning in in the face of increased industry wide price competition  we did not grow the top line in our earned premiums declined million or  in from catastrophe losses in were million compared to million in share based compensation expense  which we began to recognize in  was million 
each of these components is discussed more fully below 
revenues we measure top line growth for our insurance segments based on written premiums  which represent the premiums on policies we have issued for a period  net of reinsurance 
net written premiums provide us with an indication of how well we are doing in terms of revenue growth before it is actually earned 
the following table provides a summary by segment and line of business of our written premiums  net of reinsurance  for the years ended december  and millions change standard segment auto personal auto commercial homeowners and farmowners commercial multi peril workers compensation fire and allied lines other products liability miscellaneous personal commercial total standard nonstandard segment auto personal grand total amounts have been adjusted to exclude the unearned premium transferred in connection with the addition of the migi insurers to the pooling arrangement 
the addition of the migi insurers to the pooling arrangement was effective january  standard segment net written premiums for decreased million compared to the decrease in net written premiums in the standard segment was attributable primarily to personal and commercial auto which had a combined decrease in net written premiums of million or 
competitive pressures within the standard personal auto market are impacting the writing of new and renewal business and putting downward pressure on our existing rates 
standard personal auto  which accounts 
table of contents for of our book of business  continues to be our most profitable line of business 
as a result of the competitive market  we reduced our rates approximately during in order to remain competitive without significantly compromising our profitability 
we continue to focus on attracting new business to our standard personal auto line of business 
the primary product contributing to new business in standard personal auto is our customfit sm product which uses a multi variate rating approach that broadens the underwriting and eligibility guidelines for new customers 
having price points for a larger percentage of the personal lines market is expected to improve new business opportunities 
as of the end of  we had implemented customfit sm in states  which represented approximately of our standard personal auto written premium volume 
since introducing customfit sm in december  we have seen a significant improvement in our net written premium production trend for new business 
we believe independent agents value ease of doing business and make it an important factor in their choice of insurance companies when quoting personal auto products to their customers 
to assist in this area  in  we entered into agreements with two major comparative rating companies 
these companies products allow agents to receive rate quotes from multiple insurance companies by entering the rating information only one time 
we worked diligently in the fourth quarter with these two vendors with a launch date for implementation expected in early we believe agents will quote and write more personal standard and nonstandard auto with us as a result of a more efficient quoting process combined with more competitive rates resulting from the ongoing introduction of customfit sm for standard auto and new policy discounts introduced in for nonstandard auto 
homeowners net written premium grew in we are undertaking new homeowners pricing and product initiatives  such as a new home purchase discount and an expanded new home discount that will complement our customfit sm rollout and should position us well for the future 
the competitive pressures that have impacted personal auto have also extended to homeowners 
in general  our homeowner rate level was impacted due to downward rate changes 
farmowners net written premium was down in to improve our farmowners production  we introduced our farmowners insurance products in pennsylvania during the second quarter of our farmowners business is now active in eleven of our operating states 
in addition  a new on line farmowners rating program was introduced in all eleven states during the rating program is expected to produce more new business opportunities because we think this new system makes it easier for farm insurance agents to do business with us 
during  we enhanced our personal lines point of sale portal  netxpress sm 
this is the system our agencies use to send us business electronically 
we now have real time  on line information access capabilities that streamline the new business quote and issue process 
approximately of our personal auto and homeowner lines new business was submitted electronically in compared to in in addition in  of all personal auto and homeowner lines policy changes came to us electronically from agents 
our business insurance book of business continues to be impacted by rate competition as well as ease of doing business issues 
commercial auto net written premiums decreased in however  commercial multi peril and workers compensation net written premiums reflected positive growth 
in general  during the overall impact to net written premiums from business insurance line rate changes was a slight decrease 
we are pursuing initiatives that we anticipate will generate additional business insurance premium production over the long term 
one of our current strategic priorities is to develop a web based rating system for the three products that generate the most new business submissions 
in addition  we are developing more sophisticated pricing models to further segment our business insurance accounts  which we anticipate will improve our growth opportunities while still achieving our profit targets 
we are also emphasizing a total account 
table of contents underwriting approach in which we offer additional products to our existing accounts 
we are developing product enhancements that we believe will result in increased sales while pursuing process efficiencies to deliver product and pricing developments to the market more quickly 
during  we focused on introducing a more marketable pricing structure without forfeiting underwriting profits 
finally  we increased field underwriting authority which quickens our response to our agents 
net written premiums in our nonstandard personal auto segment decreased million in however  the nonstandard personal auto segment is beginning to stabilize  in the fourth quarter of  new business increased compared to the same period in the impact of target rate decreases coupled with the introduction of new discounts has produced what appears to be an improving premium situation 
however  we believe the personal auto market is changing quickly and dramatically 
many companies are moving to a single auto product such as our customfit sm which can accommodate most personal auto risks 
as a result  the delineation between standard and nonstandard auto insurance is becoming blurred 
the new auto programs accepting a broader range of risks has limited and is expected to continue to limit the nonstandard auto market for us and other insurers 
for all our products  we continue to emphasize that we will not compromise underwriting profitability for top line growth 
we believe that we can implement periodic rate changes in most states and remain an attractive market to our policyholders and independent agents by stressing the strengths we bring to the marketplace 
these strengths include stability  financial soundness  prompt and fair claims service  and user friendly technology which help agents do business with us and provide substantial value to our customers 
our internet based point of sale agency portal for personal lines business  netxpress sm  and our automated intelligent underwriting system  apollo  are examples of standards based technology which makes it easier for agents to submit personal lines accounts to us 
during  we added functionality for agents to acquire underwriting information reports within netxpress sm in real time  thus streamlining their new business submission processes 
apollo has also been enhanced in several ways  including the ability to efficiently and quickly underwrite new and developing claims activity on our existing book of business 
our policies provide a fixed amount of coverage for a stated period of time  often referred to as the policy term 
as such  our written premiums are recognized as earned ratably over the policy term the unearned portion of written premiums  called unearned premiums  is reflected on our balance sheet as a liability and represents our obligation to provide coverage for the unexpired terms of the policy

table of contents net investment income increased million to million in compared to the same period 
strong underwriting results in and contributed favorably to cash flows  which allowed us to increase the amount of our invested assets during total cost of invested assets at december  and was  million and  million  respectively 
also impacting our results was the fact that stfc paid off its million line of credit with state auto mutual at the end of  which had the effect of decreasing net investment income for the year by approximately million 
the annual investment yield based on average invested assets at cost was in and in we continue to allocate new monies and reinvestments to tax exempt bonds  targeting an allocation of of our total portfolio  in an effort to maximize our after tax investment income 
during the fourth quarter of  the investment committee of the board of directors of each of our insurers approved a million repositioning of the current taxable and tax exempt holdings intending to reach the targeted tax exempt allocation at a quicker pace

we reduced our estimate of future cash flows we expect to receive from these securities in light of actual default rates of the underlying collateral securities in excess of assumed defaults 
our carrying value of these securities at december  was million 
we also recognized million of other than temporary impairment related to four of our equity holdings within the consumer sector 
all four of these equity positions were sold during the other than temporary impairments recognized in were limited to these securities  based on specific facts and judgments related to these particular issuers 
most of the realized gains during were derived from the equity segment of the portfolio 
equity sales were executed during this time for various reasons  including achieving our price target 
the proceeds from these sales were mostly reinvested into equity securities of other companies 
the realized gains on the fixed income portfolio were achieved by selling shorter term municipal bonds and subsequently reinvesting those funds into longer term municipal bonds

as shown in the table above  the favorable development of million in came primarily from accident years the following are the notable items contributing to the development we hold ceded loss reserves in anticipation of transferring liabilities to reinsurers and other pools and associations 
in  ceded loss reserves developed favorably by million  meaning the actual ceded losses were above anticipated levels 
historically  we have had less ceded loss activity because our reinsurance retention levels are generally high enough to exclude most claims 
this favorable development occurred primarily in the auto and commercial multi peril lines 
favorable development at the product level is primarily from the personal auto and commercial auto liability lines  where current loss projections using more mature claim data resulted in lower expected average claim severities than past projections 
the impact is million for these two lines combined 

table of contents adjusting and other expense reserves accounted for approximately million of prior year reserve change 
these expense reserves have a proportional relationship to the overall claim inventory and held reserves by accident year  as they move up or down in relation to carried loss reserves 
since reserves decreased for the prior accident years  the expense reserves declined in a similar fashion 
the remaining favorable development is spread across several lines of business and is generally the result of having fewer claims emerge and lower claim severity  than anticipated in the estimates developed as of december  adjusting and other expense is that component of loss expenses alae and ulae both defined below that relate to costs other than defense  litigation  and medical cost containment

as of january   we began recognizing compensation expense associated with share based awards granted to employees and non employee directors within our financial statements in accordance with sfas r 
consequently  our expenses include additional share based awards of million associated with the adoption of sfas r 
prior to january   we accounted for these awards in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and related interpretations 
we adopted the guidance provided by sfas r under the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  share based compensation expense in includes the portion vesting in the period for all share based awards granted prior to  but not vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of fasb statement sfas  accounting for stock based compensation sfas  and all share based awards granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
prior to january   we provided pro forma disclosures as required under sfas the reader is referred to the complete disclosure on share based awards in note  share based awards  of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
our pro forma earnings  as reported in december  form k  included diluted per share of share based compensation expense 
for the year ended december   the comparable share based awards are diluted per share 
the expense for our share based awards is based on their fair value at date of grant and amortized over the vesting period 
at december   there was million of total unrecognized share based compensation expense related to non vested service based awards 
this expense is expected to be recognized as follows million in  million in  and million in unearned share based compensation is amortized over the vesting period for the particular grant and is recognized as a component of loss and loss adjustment expenses and acquisition and operating expenses in a manner consistent with other employee compensation in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income 
the fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes closed form pricing model 
the pricing model requires assumptions such as the expected life of the option and expected volatility of our stock over the expected life of the option  which significantly impacts the assumed fair value 
we use historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants  share based compensation expense will fluctuate in future periods 
acquisition and operating expenses  as a percentage of earned premiums the gaap expense ratio or expense ratio points  were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in our expense ratio is due in part to lower premiums in compared to  expenses associated with share based awards under sfas r see previous discussion above  as well as expenses 
table of contents related to our incentive programs  both agency and employee 
these incentive programs are directly related to our loss experience 
we do not anticipate meaningful reductions in our expense ratio during as it relates to our incentive compensation programs as well as our investment in new technologies and products as we position ourselves to be more competitive in the market place 
interest expense in was million compared to million in the decrease in interest expense was largely due to our repayment to state auto mutual of a million note at the end of the amount of interest expense related to this million note was million in for a further discussion of our debt arrangements  see liquidity and capital resources borrowing arrangements included herein 
the effective tax rate is largely affected by the amount of underwriting profit or loss and net realized investment gains or losses that are taxed at approximately relative to the amount of net investment income at its effective tax rate 
for  the effective tax rate was compared to for as previously discussed  the effective tax rate on net investment income has declined to in compared to in  primarily due to increasing our tax exempt municipal bond holdings throughout compared to our income before federal income taxes increased million to million in from the most significant factors contributing to this increase were an improvement in our loss experience from along with growth in earned premium and net investment income 
our gaap loss and lae ratio reflected an improvement to points from points in  despite being the largest catastrophe loss year in our history in terms of dollars 
as discussed in more detail below  our challenge has been to grow premiums without compromising profitability as industry wide price competition increased 
revenues the following table summarizes the consolidated earned premiums by segment and by line of business for the years ended december  and millions of change standard segment auto personal auto commercial homeowners and farmowners commercial multi peril workers compensation fire and allied lines other products liability miscellaneous personal commercial total standard nonstandard segment auto personal grand total consolidated earned premiums increased million to  million in from this increase was principally the result of the addition of the migi insurers to the pooling arrangement  previously discussed 
during  earned premiums within the standard segment increased million to million from the same period  with million of the increase points coming from the addition of 
table of contents the migi insurers to the pooling arrangement and million points from internal growth 
internal growth was primarily driven by more moderate base rate increases in most lines of business and actual decreases in other lines 
in addition  price competition in personal lines continues to be intense and is having an adverse impact on new and renewal business 
these developments are at least in part the result of an increasingly competitive market place being driven by certain insurance companies who we believe may have different underwriting performance expectations from ours 
we remain committed to achieving our goal of a combined ratio of or better  even at the expense of periodic slowdowns in earned premiums 
earned premiums within the nonstandard segment decreased million to million in from the same period 
the nonstandard automobile market is highly price sensitive  which had and is having an adverse impact on new and renewal business 
we constantly pursue rate adequacy while also working to address unprofitable agencies 
for example  over the last year  we have been working with a number of our larger and fast growing agencies in the state of minnesota where experience has not resulted in an underwriting profit 
as a result  we have recently taken corrective action and have either terminated or suspended several of these minnesota agencies which will result in a loss of both written premium and policy count in in this state 
after having achieved an acceptable level of rate adequacy  we believe we are positioned to make targeted pricing and underwriting changes designed to respond to market leaders in the nonstandard auto market 
some of these changes include more competitive rate levels  including introducing transfer credits on new business  enhancements to our classification plans and credit structures  and expansion of the underwriting market to offer higher liability limits on a selective basis 
also impacting this segment s growth is the fact that many nonstandard auto insurers have chosen to reduce rates  some substantially  in an effort to compete for market share 
in addition  with the increased utilization and refinement of multi variate rate models by many competitors  the definition of a nonstandard risk is becoming more nebulous 
as a result  what may have once been perceived as a nonstandard risk may now qualify within the standard market 
we are responding by continuing to research and develop pricing enhancements to fit with the nonstandard auto markets which have a higher potential for underwriting profit 
our biggest challenge in was top line growth in both the standard and nonstandard segments 
as a consequence  we implemented a number of initiatives to stimulate sales in personal lines new business and are working with our independent agency partners to strengthen personal lines sales techniques and skills 
known by the acronym star  this sales training for agency representatives has now been delivered to over  agency representatives  exceeding our goal of at least  program participants during additionally  we continually review our insurance programs in order to provide insurance to a broader segment in the markets in which we operate 
for example  we have expanded eligibility requirements for youthful operators within our standard segment and  as noted  are selectively offering higher limits within the nonstandard segment 
most recently we began to roll out a new standard private passenger auto multi variate rating program called customfit sm a program that is more responsive to the risk characteristics of each driver  more accurately matching price to risk  and is intended to facilitate our agency partners ability to sell this program to a broader segment of its customer base 
the objective is to preserve our prime of life product  which targets the year and older market  while also becoming more attractive to a broader range of personal lines accounts 
in  we appointed new agency partners 
each year we terminate our relationship with some agencies 
on occasion we have had to either terminate or suspend several fast growing but unprofitable agencies  as has been the case within our nonstandard segment  but for the most part  an overwhelming number of the terminated agencies are usually those that have very little premium with us 
the average premium for the agencies terminated in was  we continue to emphasize that we will not compromise underwriting profitability for top line growth 
we believe that we can implement periodic rate changes in most states and remain an attractive market to our policyholders and independent agency partners by stressing the strengths we brings to the marketplace 
these strengths include stability  financial soundness  prompt and fair claims service  and technology which make it 
table of contents easier for the agent to do business with state auto and provide substantial value to their customers 
our internet based point of sale agency portal for personal lines business  netxpress  and an automated intelligent underwriting system  apollo  are examples of standards based  user friendly technology  making it easier for agents to submit personal lines accounts to us 
recent statistics indicate that approximately of our personal auto and homeowners new business applications and of change requests in these lines are delivered and processed electronically 
this increased utilization  specifically the new business percentage representing a point improvement since year end  demonstrates that our efforts to compete on ease of doing business are achieving success 
the apollo system allows us to make consistent underwriting decisions across the standard and nonstandard lines of business 
in  the rollout of this system to additional states continued  rendering  total underwriting decisions 
this was an increase of over for new business and endorsement transactions 
we are addressing ease of doing business in other ways as well  including enhancements to our electronic portal for agents  called agentsite  and creating ways for our internet rating and underwriting systems to talk with more agency management systems 
in  agentsite dashboard was added to provide agents with quicker access to customer information and recent transactions 
this new functionality helped the agents transition following our decision to eliminate the printing and mailing of paper policy declarations to agents for personal lines 
recently  the state auto group began developing a business insurance line automation system that will build upon the success we have achieved through our netxpress system for personal lines 
netxpress allows agents to obtain rates for applicants on line in real time and secure consumer reports required for rating or underwriting  all of which combined enables the agent to offer a firm quote to a customer in real time at the point of sale 
it is the intention of the state auto group to develop similar functionality in business insurance lines 
this represents a significant commitment of resources over the next to months 
however  we believe developing this functionality is vitally important to our ability to compete for new business insurance accounts 
net investment income increased million to million in from the same period 
strong underwriting results  which contributed positively to our cash flows during  along with the million in cash received on january  from the pooling arrangement amendment  increased the amount of investable assets from total cost of invested assets at the end of and was  million and  million  respectively 
see liquidity and capital resources included herein for a discussion on cash flows from operations and financing activities 
the annualized investment yields based on average invested assets at cost decreased to in from in the following has contributed to the current year decline the continued allocation of new monies and reinvestments to tax exempt municipal bonds in an effort to maximize after tax profits 
our target allocation is of the total portfolio 
tax exempt bonds in accounted for of our portfolio compared to in in  the investment committee of the board of directors of each of our insurers approved management s recommendation to increase its target allocation for equity securities  which typically have an investment yield less than fixed maturities  in an effort to mitigate inflation risk and increase the growth potential of the portfolio 
we target those equity securities that demonstrate a history of dividend payment and potential for capital appreciation 
during  we added million  an increase of from  of new investments to the equity securities portfolio 
the combination of these portfolio actions resulted in after tax net investment income of approximately million in versus million in for an effective tax rate of and  respectively 
with the shift in our investment portfolio towards lower yielding securities before tax  the decrease in assets associated with the repayment of the million line of credit with state auto mutual in december and increased dividend rate expected to be paid per common share in discussed below  net investment income in is not expected to increase at a rate comparable to that experienced in 
table of contents realized gains and losses for the year ended december   are summarized as follows millions realized gains losses fair value at sale realized gains fixed maturities equity securities total realized gains realized losses fixed maturities equity securities total realized losses net realized gains on investments in  we recorded million in net realized investment gains as compared to million in most of the net realized gains in were in the fixed income segment of the portfolio 
in many cases  taxable bonds were sold at a profit with the proceeds being reinvested in the tax exempt segment 
these transactions helped to further the goal of increasing the tax exempt portion of the portfolio 
in other cases  bonds with lower coupons were sold with the proceeds reinvested in higher coupon bonds in order to increase our interest income 
equity securities were sold due to changing fundamentals  mergers or acquisitions  and changes in future prospects for the individual companies 
the proceeds from these equity sales were almost entirely reinvested into equity securities of other companies 
we recognized a total of million in other than temporary impairments in versus million in included in the realized losses of the fixed maturities above  was million related to other than temporary impairments on two fixed maturity securities  specifically within the other debt securities investment category  which we continued to hold at december  included in realized losses related to equity securities is million related to an other than temporary impairment on one equity position within the financial services sector of the portfolio 
at december   we no longer held this particular security 
the individual circumstances involving the other than temporary impairments recognized in were limited to those securities

table of contents a tabular presentation of the year million favorable development broken down by accident year is shown below derived from our and  year loss development table  as presented in the reserves section of our form k  narrative description of business section 
the development is measured in dollars and as a percentage of the total december   net loss and loss expense payable millions accident year current year development of ultimate liability of total net loss and loss expenses payable redundancy deficiency and prior total normal fluctuations and uncertainty associated with loss reserve development and claim settlement contributed to favorable development in the respective calendar years 
the favorable development of million in resulted in million of favorable development occurring in the accident year  with smaller amounts spread out over several accident years 
the following are the notable items contributing to the development we hold ceded loss reserves in anticipation of transferring liabilities to a reinsurer 
in  ceded loss reserves developed favorably by million  meaning the actual ceded losses were above anticipated levels 
historically we have had less ceded loss activity because our reinsurance retention levels are generally high enough to exclude most claims 
however  several liability claims emerged due to higher claim frequency and severity for our umbrella  commercial auto and other liability coverages than originally estimated 
the frequency and severity assumptions for loss activity in the ceded loss layers have been increased for future periods 
catastrophe losses also developed favorably in  contributing million in reserve decreases 
better than expected claim severity on the four florida hurricanes from was the main reason for the change 
we initially applied a similar claim average amount to all four storms  but found later that there were differences in claim averages between each storm 
adjusting and other expense reserves accounted for million of prior year reserve change 
these expense reserves have a proportional relationship to the overall claim inventory and held reserves by accident year  as they move up or down in relation to carried loss reserves 
since reserves for both catastrophes and non catastrophes decreased for the prior accident years  the expense reserves declined in a similar fashion 
the remaining favorable development is spread across several lines of business and is generally the result of having fewer claims emerge and small claim sizes  than was anticipated in the estimates developed as of december  
table of contents catastrophe losses in totaled million loss ratio points compared to million loss ratio points for the same period 
catastrophe losses occurring during were offset by net favorable development of million loss ratio points from weather related catastrophes that occurred primarily during the third and fourth quarters of during the third and fourth quarters of  we experienced weather related catastrophe losses that include losses from hurricanes cindy  dennis  katrina  ophelia  rita and wilma along with two north central states hail storms 
the most significant losses were as follows hurricane katrina  totaling million or loss ratio points  which includes reinsurance assessments  primarily from the mississippi windstorm underwriting association  of approximately million or loss ratio points  two north central states hail storms totaling million or loss ratio points  and hurricane wilma  totaling million of losses or loss ratio points 
collectively  these three weather related catastrophes accounted for million in losses or loss ratio points in the comparable period was impacted by catastrophe losses related to hurricanes charley  frances  jean and ivan 
collectively  these hurricanes contributed million in losses or loss ratio points in in today s market  the cost of the goods and services purchased by insurance companies in settling property claims has been steadily increasing at a rate higher than normal inflation 
this increase has been driven largely by the surge in demand for building materials both following the and hurricane losses as well as foreign consumption of the same materials 
as loss cost trends change  we intend to continue to adjust our pricing projections in order to ensure premiums keep pace with market conditions 
the following table summarizes the consolidated gaap loss and lae ratio by segment and by line of business for the years ended december  and  respectively improvement deterioration standard segment auto personal auto commercial homeowners and farm owners commercial multi peril workers compensation fire and allied lines other products liability miscellaneous personal commercial total standard nonstandard segment auto personal consolidated we monitor all lines of business  paying particular attention to personal auto standard and nonstandard due to the significance this line has on our profitability and the fact that it accounts for approximately of our total earned premium 
the gaap loss and lae ratio of standard personal auto increased to in from in an increase in both the frequency and severity of losses within the bodily injury coverage of this line of business largely contributed to this increase 
it is important to note that our auto rate levels are reviewed each year in detail for each state to adjust for changing claim patterns and claim costs 
in most states  this has resulted in increasing liability rates and decreasing physical damage rates 
while these loss costs trends increased for bodily injury coverage over recent quarters  we do not consider this a major deviation from the expected long term trend for the overall line 
nonetheless  we will continue to examine the auto trends by coverage and address any problems with appropriate pricing and underwriting action 

table of contents nonstandard personal auto s gaap loss and lae ratio improved loss ratio points from the same period 
we continually monitor this segment s risk selection and rate adequacy as this line of business tends to be more volatile in terms of loss frequency than the standard segment 
our focus on rate adequacy and monitoring our independent agency partners performance  in terms of both growth and profit  has significantly improved this segment s gaap loss and lae ratio from previous years  specifically and largely impacting the improvement in many of our lines of business is that is the first year that we are earning the rate changes implemented in and we are benefiting from cumulative rate changes taken over the past four years 
within the fire and allied lines  the point increase in gaap loss and lae ratio from the same period in is due to our reinsurance assessment of million related to hurricane katrina  previously discussed  which increased this line s loss and lae ratio by points 
the significant improvement in other and products liability resulted from a decline in the number of large losses in terms of both frequency and severity  including umbrella losses  as compared to while still a profitable line of business  nonetheless  the increase within the miscellaneous personal and commercial lines gaap loss and lae ratio in from is attributable to two large surety bond losses that accounted for points of the loss ratio for those lines 
for a further discussion regarding loss and loss expense reserves see other loss and loss expense reserves included herein 
acquisition and operating expenses  as a percentage of earned premiums the gaap expense ratio or expense ratio points  were and in and  respectively 
the point increase is largely due to lower than anticipated written premiums in combination with certain fixed expenses increasing 
interest expense in was million compared to million in the increase in interest expense was due to higher interest rates on variable debt in and the benefit of interest rate swaps in for a further discussion of our debt activity in and  see liquidity and capital resources borrowing arrangements included herein 
the consolidated effective tax rate is largely affected by the amount of underwriting profit or loss and net realized investment gains or losses that are taxed at approximately relative to the amount of net investment income at its effective tax rate 
the consolidated effective tax rate declined to from in this was principally due to a decline in the effective tax rate on net investment income to approximately versus in contributing to the decline was our decision to continue to increase in our holdings of tax exempt municipal bonds as previously discussed 
liquidity and capital resources general liquidity refers to our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet our needs for both long term and short term cash obligations as they come due 
our significant sources of cash are premiums  investment income  investment sales and the maturity of fixed security investments 
the significant outflows of cash are payments of claims  commissions  premium taxes  operating expenses  income taxes  dividends  interest and principal payments on debt and investment purchases 
the cash outflows can vary due to uncertainties regarding settlement of large losses or catastrophe events 
as a result  we continually monitor our investment and reinsurance programs to ensure they are appropriately structured to enable the insurance subsidiaries to meet anticipated short and long term cash requirements without the need to sell investments to meet fluctuations in claim payments 
we maintain a portion of our investment portfolio in relatively short term and highly liquid investments to ensure the immediate availability of funds to pay claims and expenses 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  in cash and cash equivalents and  million and  million  respectively  of total investments at fair value 
substantially all of our fixed maturity and equity securities are traded on public markets 
for a further discussion regarding investments see investments and market risk included herein 

table of contents our insurance subsidiaries must have adequate liquidity to ensure that their cash obligations are met 
however  because the stfc pooled companies participate in the pooling arrangement  they do not have the daily liquidity concerns normally associated with an insurance company 
this is due to the fact that  under the terms of the pooling arrangement  state auto mutual receives all premiums and pays all losses and expenses associated with the insurance business produced by the pool participants and then settles the intercompany balances generated by these transactions with the participating companies on a quarterly basis within days following each quarter end 
when settling the intercompany balances  state auto mutual provides the pool participants with full credit for the premiums written and net losses paid during the quarter and retains all receivable amounts from insureds and agents and reinsurance recoverable on paid losses from unaffiliated reinsurers 
any receivable amounts that are ultimately deemed to be uncollectible are charged off by state auto mutual and allocated to the pool member on the basis of pool participation 
as a result  we have an off balance sheet credit risk related to the balances due to state auto mutual from insureds  agents and reinsurers  which are offset by the unearned premium from the respective policies 
the state auto group s reliance on ceded reinsurance is not significant in comparison to the state auto group s total statutory surplus or our total financial position 
to minimize the risk of reinsurer default  the state auto group cedes only to third party reinsurers who are rated a or better by am best and also utilizes both domestic and international markets to diversify its credit risk 
while the total amount due to state auto mutual from policyholders and agents is significant  the individual amounts due are relatively small at the policyholder and agency level 
based on historical data  this credit risk exposure is not considered to be material to our financial position  though the impact to income on a quarterly basis may be material 
the state auto group mitigates its exposure to this credit risk through its in house collections unit for both personal and commercial accounts which is supplemented by third party collection service providers 
the amounts deemed uncollectible by state auto mutual and allocated to the stfc pooled companies are included in other expenses in the accompanying statements of income 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the significant sources of operating cash flows are derived from underwriting operations and investment income 
the positive cash flows over the three year period is largely due to favorable underwriting and investment income cash flows  offset by increases in cash paid on estimated federal income taxes  interest expense and cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plan the pension plan 
cash from operations for decreased from due to our decline in net written premiums as previously discussed along with an increase in the amount of loss and loss expenses paid from the increased level of catastrophe losses between the two years 
in addition  benefited from the million received from the january  pooling arrangement amendment described above 
over the last three years  operating cash flows have been sufficient to meet our operating needs while providing increased opportunities for investment 
however  should our written premium decline or paid losses increase significantly our cash flows from operations could be impacted requiring us to liquidate investments 
we utilize reinsurance to limit our loss exposure and contribute to our liquidity and capital resources 
for a discussion of our reinsurance arrangements  see reinsurance arrangements included herein 
during  and  as permitted by regulations of the internal revenue service  we made cash contributions of million  million and million  respectively  to the pension plan on behalf of our employees 
the actuarially determined contribution to the pension plan ranges from the minimum amount we would be required to contribute to the maximum amount that would be tax deductible 
amounts contributed in excess of the minimum are deemed voluntary while amounts in excess of the maximum would be subject to an excise tax and may not be deductible for tax purposes 
amounts paid in each of these three years were within the minimum and maximum funding amounts that would be deductible for tax purposes 
the actuarially determined funding amount to the pension plan is generally not determined until the second quarter with respect to the contribution year  though we currently expect to make a cash contribution to the pension plan of approximately million during for a further discussion regarding our pension plan see employee benefit plans included herein

table of contents see our contractual obligations table included in contractual obligations 
reinsurance arrangements members of the state auto group follow the customary industry practice of reinsuring a portion of their exposures and paying to the reinsurers a portion of the premiums received 
insurance is ceded principally to reduce net liability on individual risks or for individual loss occurrences  including catastrophic losses 
although reinsurance does not legally discharge the individual members of the state auto group from primary liability for the full amount of limits applicable under their policies  it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the extent of the reinsurance ceded 
for the first two quarters of  there were no material changes in our reinsurance arrangements from those in place as of december  however  as of july  we made revisions to our casualty excess of loss  property per risk excess of loss  and property catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance programs through treaties arranged through a reinsurance intermediary with several reinsurers 
the terms of the casualty excess of loss program provide that each company in the state auto group is responsible for the first million of a covered loss 
coverage under the casualty excess of loss program was expanded as of july   so that reinsurers became responsible for of a covered loss in excess of million  up to million of covered loss  compared to under the previous program 
also  certain unusual claim situations involving bodily injury liability  property damage  uninsured motorist and personal injury protection are covered by an arrangement that provides for million of coverage in excess of million retention for each loss occurrence 
this layer of reinsurance sits above the million excess of million arrangement 
the rates for this reinsurance are negotiated annually 
the property per risk excess of loss program was revised as of july   so that each company within the our state auto group became responsible for the first million of each covered loss  compared to the first million of each covered loss under the previous program 
the previous retention of million had been in place for nine years 
the state auto group s capacity to retain more direct exposure has grown over that time  and raising the retention under this program tempered the effect of higher property reinsurance rates in also as of july   coverage was expanded so that reinsurers became responsible for of the excess over the retention up to million of covered losses  compared to up to million of covered loss previously 
increasing the amount of reinsurance limits purchased under this program allowed the state auto group to reduce the amount of facultative reinsurance purchased for property limits between million and million  resulting in a cost savings 
the rates for this reinsurance are negotiated annually 
the property catastrophe excess of loss program was revised as of july   so that the state auto group began to retain the first million of catastrophe loss per occurrence  compared to the first million of catastrophe loss per occurrence under the previous program 
the previous retention of million had been in place for years 
the state auto group s capacity to retain more direct exposure has grown over that time  and raising the retention under this program tempered the effect of higher property reinsurance rates in the amount of reinsurance coverage did not change at july  excess of the million retention  this program which provides traditional catastrophe reinsurance coverage continues to provide coverage for the next million of covered loss with a co participation 
the rates for this reinsurance are negotiated annually 
we also participate in an intercompany catastrophe reinsurance agreement by which state auto p c acts as the catastrophe reinsurer for the state auto group 
this agreement was revised as of july   so that the coverage attaches at million of catastrophe loss per occurrence  compared to the first million of catastrophe loss per occurrence under the previous program 
this change is a direct result of the change in retention under the property catastrophe excess of loss program discussed in the previous paragraph 
the amount of reinsurance coverage did not change at july  excess of the million retention  this program continues to provide coverage for the next million of covered loss 
there have been no losses assumed under this agreement 

table of contents in addition to the treaties described above  the state auto group is also party to treaties for workers compensation excess of loss and workers compensation catastrophe excess of loss 
these treaties were renewed july  with no material revisions 
the terms of the workers compensation excess of loss program provide that each company in the state auto group is responsible for the first million of covered loss 
the reinsurers are responsible for of the excess over million up to million of covered loss 
net retentions under this contract may be submitted to the casualty excess of loss program  subject to a limit of million per loss occurrence 
the rates for this reinsurance are negotiated annually 
the workers compensation catastrophe excess of loss treaty provides an additional layer of excess of loss reinsurance for workers compensation losses involving multiple workers 
subject to million of retention  reinsurers are responsible for of the excess over million up to million of covered loss 
this coverage is subject to a maximum any one life limit of million 
the rates for this reinsurance are negotiated annually 
the state auto group has also secured other reinsurance to limit the net cost of large loss events for certain types of coverage 
included are umbrella liability losses which are reinsured up to a limit of million with a maximum million retention 
the state auto group also makes use of facultative reinsurance for unique risk situations and participates in involuntary pools and associations in certain states

regulatory considerations at december   and  each of our insurance subsidiaries was in compliance with statutory requirements relating to capital adequacy 
the national association of insurance commissioners naic utilizes a collection of analytical tools designed to assist state insurance departments with an integrated approach to screening and analyzing the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states 
one such set of analytical tools is key financial ratios that are known in the insurance industry as the iris ratios 
iris ratios are derived from financial statements prepared on a statutory accounting basis  which are accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the insurance department with regulatory authority over our insurance subsidiaries 
a defined range of results for each ratio has been established by the naic for solvency monitoring 
while management utilizes each of these iris ratios in monitoring our insurance companies operating performance on a statutory accounting basis each of our insurance subsidiaries operates within the defined range for the other measures  the net written premium to statutory surplus ratio the leverage ratio is monitored to ensure that each of our insurance subsidiaries continue to operate within the defined range of to the higher the leverage ratio  the more risk a company bears in relation to statutory surplus available to absorb losses 
in considering this range  management also considers the distribution of net premiums between property and liability lines of business 
a company with a larger portion of net premiums from liability lines should generally maintain a lower leverage ratio 
the statutory leverage ratios for our insurance subsidiaries at december   and were as follows statutory leverage ratios state auto p c milbank farmers sa ohio sa national weighted average we use the statutory leverage ratio as there is no comparable gaap measure 
our insurance subsidiaries pay dividends to state auto financial which in turn may be used by state auto financial to pay dividends to stockholders or to make principal and interest payments on debt 
individual states limit the amount of dividends that our insurance subsidiaries domiciled in those states can pay without prior approval 
the maximum amount of dividends that may be paid to state auto financial during by its insurance subsidiaries without prior approval under current law is limited to million  adjusted for dividends paid by the insurance subsidiaries in the previous twelve months 
state auto financial received no 
table of contents dividends from its insurance subsidiaries in and million and million in and  respectively 
we are required to notify the insurance subsidiaries applicable state insurance commissioner within five business days after declaration of all such dividends and at least ten days prior to payment 
additionally  the domiciliary state commissioner of each insurance subsidiary has the authority to limit a dividend when the commissioner determines  based on factors set forth in the law  that an insurer s surplus is not reasonable in relation to the insurer s outstanding liabilities and adequate to meet its financial needs 
such restrictions are not expected to limit the capacity of state auto financial to meet its cash obligations 
state auto financial s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by the states in which they do business 
the naic has developed risk based capital rbc requirements 
rbc attempts to relate an individual insurance company s statutory surplus to the risk inherent in its overall operations 
rbc requires the calculation of a ratio of total adjusted statutory capital to authorized control level 
insurers with a ratio below are subject to different levels of regulatory intervention and action 
at december   the ratio of total adjusted statutory capital to authorized control level of state auto financial s insurance subsidiaries ranged from to

table of contents other investments overview stateco performs investment management services on our behalf and that of state auto mutual and its subsidiaries 
the investment committee of the board of directors of each of our insurers sets investment policies to be followed by stateco 
our primary investment objectives are to generate income  preserve capital and maintain adequate liquidity for the payment of claims 
our current investment strategy does not rely on the use of derivative financial instruments 
our investment policy and guidelines permit investment in debt issues rated a or better by two major rating services 
our fixed maturities portfolio is composed of high quality  investment grade issues  comprised almost entirely of debt issues rated aaa or aa 
we do not hold any mortgage loans 
we manage our equity portfolio by investing in a large  but manageable  number of stocks from many different industries 
this diversification across companies and industries reduces volatility in the value of the equity portfolio 
we invest only in stocks that currently pay a dividend 
as of december   our equity portfolio consisted of approximately different stocks 
the largest single position was of the equity portfolio based on fair value and the top ten positions were equal to approximately of the equity portfolio

therefore  when large cap stocks and or value stocks perform well our portfolio typically performs well 
conversely  when growth stocks outperform value and or small to mid cap stocks outperform large cap  our portfolio does not perform as well 
at december  and  all investments in fixed maturity and equity securities were held as available for sale and therefore are carried at fair value 
the unrealized holding gains or losses  net of applicable deferred taxes  are shown as a separate component of stockholders equity  specifically within accumulated other comprehensive loss income and as such are not included in the determination of net income 

table of contents the following table provides the composition of our investment portfolio at december  and  respectively millions fair value fixed maturities equity securities other invested assets total investments we regularly monitor our investment portfolio for declines in value that are other than temporary  an assessment which requires significant management judgment regarding the evidence known 
such judgments could change in the future as more information becomes known which could negatively impact the amounts reported herein 
among the factors that management considers are the nature of the investment  severity and length of decline in fair value  events impacting the issuer  overall market conditions  and our intent and ability to hold securities until recovery 
when a security in our investment portfolio has been determined to have a decline in fair value that is other than temporary  we adjust the cost basis of the security to fair value 
this results in a charge to earnings as a realized loss  which is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value 
future increases or decreases in fair value  if not other than temporary  are included in other comprehensive income 
other than the impairment write downs previously discussed  a review of our investments at december  determined no additional other than temporary impairment exists in the gross unrealized holding losses  as provided in the table below  due to the evidence that exists indicating temporary impairment 
at december   there were no investments reflected in the table below with an unrealized holding loss that had a fair value significantly below cost continually for more than one year

in and part of  we participated in a securities lending program whereby certain fixed maturity and equity securities from our investment portfolio were loaned to other institutions for short periods of time 
we required collateral  equal to of the market value of the loaned securities 
the collateral was invested by the lending agent  in accordance with our guidelines  generating investment income  net of applicable fees 
we accounted for this program as a secured borrowing and recorded the collateral held and corresponding liability to return the collateral on our balance sheet 
during the second quarter of  we terminated our participation in this program and there were no securities on loan or related collateral held as of september  at december   the amount of collateral held was approximately million and the amount of securities lent was million 
market risk at december   total investments at fair value comprise approximately of our total assets 
of our total investments  were invested in fixed maturities  in equity securities  and in other invested assets 
cash and cash equivalents represented approximately of our total assets at december  our decision to make a specific investment is influenced primarily by the following factors a investment risks  b general market conditions  c relative valuations of investment vehicles  d general market interest rates  e our liquidity requirements at any given time  and f our current federal income tax position and relative spread between after tax yields on tax exempt and taxable fixed income investments 
our primary market risk exposures are to changes in market prices for equity securities and changes in interest rates and credit ratings for fixed maturity securities 
our fixed income securities are subject to interest rate risk whereby the value of the securities varies as market interest rates change 
we manage this risk by closely monitoring the duration of the fixed income portfolio 
the duration of the fixed maturity portfolio was approximately and as of december  and  respectively 
the table below summarizes our interest rate risk and shows the effects of a parallel change in interest rates on the fair value of the fixed income portfolio excluding other debt securities as of december  fair value millions change in interest rates bps value as of original value 
table of contents this table summarizes only the effects that a parallel change in interest rates could have on the fixed income portfolio 
this change in rates would also change the value of our liabilities and possibly other financial assets 
we caution the reader that this analysis does not take into account nonparallel changes in interest rates 
it is likely that some rates would increase or decrease more than others depending upon market conditions at the time of the change 
this nonparallel change would alter the value of the fixed income portfolio 
the analysis is also limited in that it does not take into account any actions that might be taken by us in response to these changes 
as a result  the actual impact of a change in interest rates and the resulting fixed income values may differ significantly from what is shown in the table 
we believe that the fixed income portfolio s exposure to credit risk is minimal as greater than of the bonds owned are rated aa or better with the remaining bonds being a rated 
we do not intend to change our investment policy on the quality of our fixed maturity investments 
the fixed maturity portfolio is managed in a laddered maturity style and considers business mix and liability payout patterns to ensure adequate cash flow to meet claims as they are presented 
we also manage liquidity risk by maintaining sufficient cash balances  owning some agency and us treasury securities at all times  purchasing bonds of major issuers  and purchasing bonds that are part of a medium or large issue 
the fixed income portfolio does not have any direct exposure to either exchange rate risk or commodity risk 
we do not rely on the use of derivative financial instruments 
to provide us greater flexibility in order to manage our market risk exposures  we categorize our fixed maturities as available for sale 
we do not maintain a trading portfolio 
as of december   our equity portfolio had a beta of using the s p index as a benchmark 
beta estimates the degree the portfolio s price will fluctuate based on a given movement in the market index 
the table below reflects what changes might occur in the value of the equity portfolio given a change in the s p index fair value millions change in s p index value as of original value the above analysis is limited in that it does not take into account any actions that might be taken by us in response to these changes 
as a result  the actual impact of a change in equity market prices and the resulting equity values may differ significantly from what is shown in the table 
by investing in mostly large cap issues we hope to limit liquidity risk in the equity portfolio 
the equity portfolio does not have any direct exposure to exchange rate risk since we do not hold any foreign stocks 
we constantly monitor the equity portfolio holdings for any credit risk issues that may arise 
we do not invest in any commodity futures or commodity oriented mutual funds 
some parameters have been set by the investment committee of the board of directors of each of our insurers to help manage the risks associated with the investment portfolio 
for the insurance subsidiaries  the maximum investment in any single note or bond is limited to of statutory assets  other than obligations of the us government or government agencies  for which there is no limit 
investments in equity securities are selected based on their potential for appreciation as well as ability to continue paying dividends 
the equity portfolio is diversified across industries and concentrations in any one company or industry are limited by parameters established by the investment committee of the board of directors of each of our insurers 
the total holding of a specific stock should not exceed of the outstanding stock and based on market value at the time of purchase  no one equity holding should exceed of the total equity portfolio 
up to of the equity portfolio may deviate from these requirements allowing us to invest in timely special situations 
equity investments will normally be targeted to no more than of total assets or of statutory surplus whichever is greater 
additional information regarding the composition of investments  along with maturity schedules regarding investments in fixed maturities at december   is presented in tabular form above 

table of contents our total investments  at fair value  grew approximately during to  million at december   from  million at december  this growth was generated primarily from net cash flows provided by operations  along with an increase of million in the cumulative net unrealized gains on investments 
the net unrealized gain on our equity portfolio increased million to million at december   while our net unrealized gains on our fixed maturity portfolio declined million to million at december  cumulative unrealized gains related to other invested assets decreased million to million at december  employee benefit plans the state auto group has a defined benefit pension plan pension plan and a postretirement health care plan covering substantially all employees collectively the benefit plans 
several factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the benefit plans 
key factors include assumptions about the expected rates of return on plan assets  discount rates  and health care cost trend rates 
we consider market conditions  including changes in investment returns and interest rates  in making these assumptions 
we use a measurement date of september as currently permitted under sfas no 
employers accounting for pensions sfas and sfas no 
employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions sfas when determining our liabilities at december to calculate the state auto group s december  pension projected benefit obligation pbo we used a discount rate of based on an evaluation of the expected future benefit cash flows of the pension plan used in conjunction with the citigroup pension discount curve at the measurement date 
a lower discount rate results in  all else equal  a higher present value of the benefit obligation 
we selected an expected long term rate of return on our plan assets of by considering the mix of investments and stability of investment portfolio along with actual investment experience during the lifetime of the plan 
to calculate the net periodic benefit cost for the year ended december   a discount rate of and an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of were used 
the selected discount rate of increased points from the rate used in which had the effect of decreasing the pbo and related unrecognized net actuarial loss by approximately million 
cumulative unrecognized actuarial losses of approximately million  which are now being recognized on our balance sheet pursuant to sfas defined below  are being systematically recognized as an increase in net periodic cost over approximately a year period  which represents the average future service period of active participants 
unrecognized gains and losses arise from several factors including expected to actual demographic changes  assumption changes in the obligations and from the difference between expected and actual returns on plan assets 
the accumulated benefit obligation abo of a defined benefit plan represents the actuarial present value of benefits attributed by the pension benefit formula to employee service rendered prior to the measurement date and based on current and past compensation levels  while the pbo is the abo plus a factor for future compensation levels 
at december   the abo and pbo were million and million  respectively 
the amount of pbo was reflected on our balance sheet at december  with our adoption of the first phase of sfas defined below as measured against the pension plan assets 
at december  the fair value of the pension plan assets was million  which resulted in an underfunding status within our balance sheet of million 
the state auto group has consistently targeted contributions to the pension plan with the objective of maintaining a fully funded status on an abo basis 
historically our plan assets have exceeded our abo 
the abo  which considers current compensations level only  provides information about the obligation an employer would have if the plan were discontinued at the date of measurement date 
this funding objective has served our plan participants well knowing that we were fully funded on a current basis as well as the fact that we have not had to recognize in or anytime prior an additional minimum liability as would have been previously required under sfas 
table of contents key assumptions used in determining the amount of the benefit obligation and related periodic cost recognized for postretirement benefits other than pensions under sfas include the discount rate and the assumed health care cost trend rate 
to calculate the state auto group s benefit obligation for our health care plan  we increased our selected discount rate by points to from the discount rate to match the anticipated stream of future benefit payments 
this change in the discount rate had the effect of decreasing the benefit obligation and related unrecognized net actuarial loss by million 
we assume that the relative increase in health care costs will generally trend downward over the next several years  reflecting assumed increases in efficiency in the health care system and cost containment initiatives 
for the expected rate of increase in future health care costs was for  trending down per year to thereafter 
if the assumed future health care cost trend rate had been increased or decreased by one percentage point  our benefit obligation for would have increased by million and decreased by million  respectively 
the benefit obligation under our health care plan was million at december  which exceeded the fair value of plan assets of million  resulting in an underfunding status of million in our balance sheet 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas which requires employers with defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans  such as health care  to recognize the funded status of its benefit plans on its balance sheet and measure the fair value of plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the fiscal year end balance sheet date thereby eliminating the use of an earlier measurement date and to provide additional disclosures 
the new measurement date requirement is not effective until fiscal years ended after december  adopting sfas required us to recognize the funded status ie the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligations on our balance sheet  with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
the adoption of sfas at december  had the impact of decreasing accumulated comprehensive income by million  net of tax  which was represented by the following for our pension plan net unrecognized actuarial losses of million million net of tax  unrecognized prior service costs of million million net of tax  unrecognized transition asset remaining from the initial adoption of sfas of million million net of tax  all of which were previously netted against the plan s funded status on our balance sheet pursuant to the provisions of sfas these amounts will be subsequently recognized as a component of our net periodic cost benefit pursuant to our historical accounting policy for amortizing and allocating such amounts 
the amount of amortization expected to be recognized during the fiscal year ending december  for the state auto group is million million net of tax  million million net of tax  and a benefit of million million net of tax  respectively 
for our postretirement health care plan net unrecognized actuarial losses of million million net of tax  unrecognized prior service costs of million million net of tax  all of which were previously netted against the plan s funded status in our balance sheet pursuant to the provisions of sfas these amounts will be subsequently recognized as a component of our net periodic cost benefit pursuant to our historical accounting policy for amortizing and allocating such amounts 
the amount of amortization expected to be recognized during the fiscal year ending december  for the state auto group is million million net of tax and million million net of tax  respectively 

table of contents the following table provides the incremental effects of adopting the provisions of sfas on our balance sheet at december  the adoption of sfas had no effect on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december   or for any prior period presented  and it will not affect our operating results in the future 
millions prior to adopting sfas effect of adopting sfas as reported at assets net prepaid pension expense deferred federal income taxes liabilities postretirement benefits pension benefits stockholders equity accumulated other comprehensive income loss with regard to the adoption of the new measurement guidelines  we are continuing to review the transition alternatives available to us 
the adoption of sfas did not have an impact on our debt covenants 
on december   the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act was signed into law 
the act expanded medicare to include  for the first time  coverage for prescription drugs 
in may of  the fasb issued fasb staff position  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of fsp 
fsp provided guidance on accounting for the effects of the act for employers that sponsor postretirement health care plans that provide drug benefits 
we and our actuarial advisors completed a review of its plan provisions and concluded that the benefits provided by its plan are actuarially equivalent to medicare part d and will be entitled to the subsidy 
we determined that the enactment of the act was not a significant event and incorporated the effect of the act in the measurement date pursuant to fsp the actuarial assumptions used by us in determining benefit obligations may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower turnover and retirement rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our financial position or results of operations 
loss and loss expense reserves our loss and loss expense reserves include the accumulation of unpaid individual case estimates for claims that have been reported and estimates of claims that have been incurred but not reported ibnr as well as estimates of the expenses associated with processing and settling all reported and unreported claims 
our loss and loss expense reserves are not discounted to present value 
losses and allocated loss expense reserves loss and alae reserve are management s best estimates mbe at a given point in time of what we expect to pay claimants  based on known facts  circumstances and historical trends 
reserves for reported losses are established on either a case by case or formula basis depending on the type and circumstances of the loss 
the case by case reserve amounts are determined by claims adjusters based on our reserving practices  which take into account the type of risk  the circumstances surrounding each claim and policy provisions relating to types of loss 
the formula reserves are based on historical data for similar claims with provision for trend changes caused by inflation 
case and formula basis loss reserves are reviewed on a regular basis  and as new data becomes available  estimates are updated resulting in adjustments to loss 
table of contents reserves 
generally  reported losses initially reserved on a formula basis and not settled after six months are case reserved at that time 
the process for calculating the ibnr component of the loss and alae reserve is to develop an estimate of the ultimate losses and allocated loss expenses incurred  and then subtract all amounts already paid and held in case and formula reserves 
the ultimate determination of mbe integrates information and analysis provided by several disciplines within our company  including claims  actuarial and accounting 
this assessment requires considerable judgment in understanding how claims mature  which lines of business are the most volatile  and how trends change over time 
loss and alae reserves represent an estimate at a given point in time based on many variables including historical and statistical information  inflation  legal developments  storm loss estimates  and economic conditions 
although we consider many different sources of information  as well as a number of actuarial methodologies to estimate our loss and alae reserve  there is no single method for determining the exact ultimate liability 
our internal actuarial staff conducts quarterly reviews of projected loss development information to assist management in making estimates of ultimate losses and loss expenses 
several factors are considered in estimating ultimate liabilities including consistency in relative case reserve adequacy  consistency in claims settlement practices  recent legal developments  historical data  actuarial projections  accounting projections  exposure growth  current business conditions  catastrophe developments  and late reported claims 
in addition  reasonableness tests are performed on many of the assumptions underlying each reserving methodology  such as claim frequency  claim severity and loss ratios 
nonetheless  changes  which are not contemplated  do occur over time  and those changes are incorporated in subsequent valuations of the loss reserves 
we use a number of different methodologies to estimate the ibnr component of the loss and alae reserves 
our reserves include amounts related to short tail and long tail lines of business 
tail refers to the time period between the occurrence of a loss and the settlement of the claim 
the longer the time span between the incidence of a loss and the settlement of the claim  the more the ultimate settlement amount can vary 
the reserving methods and strengths and weaknesses of each are described below 
short tail business for short tailed contracts  the claims are typically settled within five years  and the most common actuarial estimates are based on techniques using link ratio projections of incurred losses  paid losses  claim counts and claim severities 
each of these methods is described below in detail 
separate projections are made for catastrophes that are in the very early stages of development based on specific information known through the reporting date 
incurred loss development method the incurred loss development method is probably the most common actuarial method used in projecting indicated ibnr reserves 
this method uses paid loss experience as well as the outstanding estimates average case reserves for claims that have been reported and are still open 
the underlying assumption of the incurred loss development method is that case reserve adequacy remains consistent over time 
this method s advantage is its responsiveness to changes in reported losses  which is particularly valuable in the less mature accident years 
the disadvantage of the incurred loss development method is that case reserve adequacy changes will distort the ibnr projections 
paid loss development method the paid loss development methods use calculations that are very similar to the incurred loss development method 
the key difference is that the data used in paid methods excludes the case reserve estimates  so only paid losses are utilized 
with these methods  a payment pattern is estimated to project ultimate settlement values for each accident year  with the underlying assumption that claims are settled at a consistent rate over time 
neither case reserves nor the rate at which claims are reported except to the extent that the reporting pattern might influence the payment pattern is relevant to the results of this method 
this method s advantage is the estimates of ultimate loss are independent of case reserve adequacy and are unaffected by company changes in case reserving philosophy 
the disadvantages are that the paid method does not use all of the available information  and in some cases the liability payment patterns require the application of very large development factors to relatively small payments in the immature years 

table of contents claim counts and severities methods the counts and severities method calculations are very similar to the other methods 
the incurred claim counts reported to date are projected to an ultimate value 
similarly  the incurred loss severities are projected to ultimate 
the ultimate incurred count is multiplied by the ultimate incurred severity  for each accident year  to arrive at the ultimate incurred loss 
finally  as with the other loss development methods  an estimate of the ibnr reserve is calculated by subtracting the reported losses from the estimated ultimate losses 
long tail business reserve estimates for long tailed contracts use the same methods listed above for short tailed lines  along with several other methods as determined by the actuary 
for example  premium based methods may be used in developing ultimate loss estimates  including the expected loss ratio  bornhuetter ferguson  and least squares techniques as described below 
we also use statistical models when the historical patterns can be reasonably approximated 
expected loss ratio method the expected loss ratio method generates indicated ibnr by multiplying an expected loss ratio by earned premium  then subtracting incurred to date losses 
for slower reporting lines of business  new products  or data that is very immature  the actual claim data is often too thin for traditional projections 
with this method the premiums are used as a measure of loss exposure  and the loss ratios can be derived from pricing expectations 
bornhuetter ferguson method the bornhuetter ferguson method is a weighted average of the expected loss ratio method and the incurred loss development method  using the percentage of losses reported as the weight 
this method is particularly useful where there is a low volume of data in the current accident period  or where the experience is volatile 
in general this method produces estimates that are very similar to the incurred loss development method 
least square loss development method in the least squares loss development method the statistical technique of least squares regression is applied to a triangle of reported loss ratios to project the ultimate loss ratio in each accident year 
using historical loss ratios puts the data for each time period on a more consistent exposure basis  because premium levels generally correlate well with insured exposures 
a by product of the regression function is an estimate of credibility for each stage of development 
in cases where the regression parameters fall outside of a reasonable range  the projection defaults to the incurred loss method 
selection process in determining which reserving method to use for a particular line of business or accident year  diagnostic tests of loss ratios and severity trends are considered  as well as the historic case reserve adequacy and claim settlement rate 
in general the incurred loss development method is used if the projections are stable  the data is credible  historic case reserve adequacy is consistent  and the loss ratios and loss severities are reasonable 
other reserving methods are considered as well for particular lines of business or accident years  given supplementary information like open claim counts and prior period development 
for example  if more than one method provides a reasonable projection  the actuary may select an average of those methods 
there is considerable judgment applied in the analysis of the historical patterns and in applying business knowledge that reflects our underwriting and claims risk 
reserve ranges provide a quantification of the variability in the reserve projections  which is often referred to as the standard deviation or error term  while the point estimates establish a mean  or expected value for the ultimate reserve 
the primary determinant in estimating the reserve range boundaries are the variances measured within the historical reserving data for lines of business 
property lines typically have smaller variances  while liability lines can experience significant variability 
mbe of loss reserves considers the actuarial point estimate and expected variation to establish an appropriate position within a range 
mbe for sa national and the stfc pooled companies share of the pooled companies loss and alae reserves at december  is million  compared with an actuarial point estimate of million that is within a projected range of million to million 
these values presented are on a direct basis  gross of salvage and subrogation 
table of contents recoverable  and before reinsurance  except for the stfc pooled companies participation in the inter company pooling arrangement 
therefore  these values cannot be compared to other loss and loss expenses payable tables included elsewhere within this form k 
the potential impact of the reserve variability on net income is quantifiable using the range end points and carried reserve amounts listed above 
for example  if ultimate losses reach the high point of million  the reserve increase of million is an after tax decrease of million on net income 
likewise  should losses decline to the low end of million  the million reserve decrease would add million of after tax net income 
an important assumption underlying the reserve estimation methods for the major casualty lines is that the loss cost trends implicitly built into the loss and alae patterns will continue into the future 
to estimate the sensitivity of reserves to an unexpected change in inflation  projected calendar year payment patterns were applied to the december   other liability loss and alae reserve to generate estimated annual incremental loss and alae payments for each subsequent calendar year 
then  for purposes of sensitivity testing  an additional annual loss cost trend of was added to the trend implicitly embedded in the estimated payment pattern  and revised incremental loss and alae payments were calculated 
this type of inflationary jump could arise from a variety of sources including tort law changes  development of new medical procedures  social inflation  and other inflationary changes in costs beyond assumed levels 
the estimated cumulative impact that this additional  unexpected increase in the loss cost trend would have on our results of operations over the lifetime of the underlying claims in other liability is an increase of million on reserves  or a million after tax reduction assuming a tax rate of to net income 
inflation changes have much more impact on the longer tail commercial lines like other liability and workers compensation  and much less impact on the shorter tail personal lines reserves 
in addition to establishing loss and alae reserves  as described above  we establish reserves for loss adjustment expenses contemplating functions and costs that are not attributable to a specific claim  which is called unallocated loss adjustment expense ulae 
historical ratios of paid ulae to paid losses are developed  and then imposed on the current outstanding reserves 
consequently  this component of the loss expense reserve has a proportional relationship to the overall claim inventory and held reserves by accident year  as they move up or down in sync with carried reserves 
the method uses a traditional assumption that of the expenses are realized when the claim is open  and the other are incurred as the loss payments are made and also assumes that the underlying claims process and mix of business do not change drastically over time

the property and casualty industry has had significant loss experience from claims related to asbestos  environmental remediation  product liability  mold and other mass torts 
asbestos reserves are million  and environmental reserves are million  for a total of million  or of net losses and loss expenses payable 
our environmental reserves increased approximately million from primarily from the state of indiana where there was an adverse court ruling several years ago 
because we have insured primarily product retailers and distributors  we do not expect to incur the same level of liability as companies that have insured manufacturing risks 
the risks and uncertainties inherent in the estimates include  but are not limited to  actual settlement experience being different from historical data and trends  changes in business and economic conditions  court decisions creating unanticipated liabilities  ongoing interpretation of policy provisions by the courts  inconsistent decisions in lawsuits regarding coverage and additional information discovered before settlement of claims 
our results of operations and financial condition could be impacted  perhaps significantly  in the future if the ultimate payments required to settle claims vary from the liability currently recorded

sop focuses on modifications to contracts with integrated product features and internal replacement of contracts in which the new contract offers product features not included in the old contract when both were priced together 
our insurance contracts include only nonintegrated contract features as defined in sop  which are contract features that provide coverage that is underwritten and priced only for that incremental insurance coverage and that do not result in re underwriting or re pricing of other components of the contract 
nonintegrated contract features do not change the existing base contract and do not require further evaluation under sop given the nature of the policies written by us  the impact of sop upon implementation will not be material 
we plan to adopt this guidance effective january  impact of significant external factors inflation can have a significant impact on property and casualty insurers because premium rates are established before the amount of losses and loss expenses are known 
when establishing rates  we attempt to anticipate increases from inflation subject to the limitations of modeling economic variables 
general inflation  as measured by the consumer price index  has been relatively modest over the last several years 
however  price inflation on the goods and services purchased by insurance companies in settling claims has been steadily increasing 
in particular  repair costs for homes  autos  commercial buildings  and medical care costs  have risen disproportionately over the last few years 
costs for building materials typically rise dramatically following substantial natural catastrophes such as the industry experienced in florida and adjacent states in and in mississippi and alabama in we continue to adjust our pricing projections as loss cost trends change in order to ensure premiums keep pace with inflation in all lines of business 

table of contents we consider inflation when estimating liabilities for losses and loss expenses  particularly for claims having a long period between occurrence and settlement 
the liabilities for losses and loss expenses are management s best estimates of the ultimate net cost of underlying claims and expenses and are not discounted for the time value of money 
in times of high inflation  the normally higher yields on investment income may partially offset potentially higher claims and expenses 
in loss and loss expenses reserves  we include a discussion of certain factors management considers in estimating the ultimate liability for losses and loss expenses 
with respect to the auto line of business  which represents approximately of our total reserves  perhaps the most significant external variable is legal developments 
court decisions  as discussed below  have had significant impact on the property and casualty insurance industry 
some of these decisions have a more prospective effect  for example  when contract provisions relating to third party coverages are construed in ways not anticipated by us 
other court decisions may have more of a retroactive effect which may be seen more clearly in the auto insurance line 
auto insurance tends to be a line of business more regulated by statutes  consequently  the courts tend to have more of an opportunity to construe and apply those statutes to existing contracts 
uninsured motorists and underinsured motorists collectively um are statutory coverages in almost every state where we do business 
if a court construes a um statute adversely to us and the industry  the decision typically has a retroactive effect with the court s interpretation being applied as if the um statute has always been interpreted that way 
this retroactive application is exacerbated in um cases and other first party coverage cases because the statute of limitations applicable to um claims and other first party coverages can be as long as years 
claims that had been closed or not even presented  going back as long as fifteen years  can be restored by an adverse court decision 
we consider the impact of adverse court decisions of which we have become aware when we set ultimate loss and loss expense reserves for auto insurance as well as other lines to the extent those lines may be retroactively affected by such matters 
the effect of court decisions is also apparent in the commercial lines of coverages such as commercial multi peril and other liability and products liability 
courts can expand coverage or void exclusions which can increase our exposure to claims 
some of these third party claims may still be brought within the statute of limitations applicable to such third party claims and expose us to some retroactive liabilities 
these liabilities are sought to be addressed by the ultimate loss and loss expense reserve that is our estimate of loss and loss expenses payable 
it is not feasible to quantify the impact of judicial decisions that may have retroactive effect because we cannot foresee  among the range of issues that are litigated every day in courts in each state in which we do business  which cases will be decided adversely and how such decisions will actually apply to us 
the reserve estimates do not contemplate substantial loss from any mass torts  including those already listed above  or others not known at this time 
in addition  there is no provision in the reserves for a major retroactive expansion of coverage through judicial interpretation 
if these assumptions prove to be incorrect  ultimate liabilities could increase substantially 
our claims  underwriting and actuarial staff track separately all claims within the family of mass torts  and respond accordingly as information becomes known 
premium rates are actuarially determined to enable an insurance company to generate an underwriting profit 
these rates contemplate a certain level of risk 
the courts may modify  in a number of ways  the level of risk which insurers had expected to assume including eliminating exclusions  multiplying limits of coverage  creating rights for policyholders not intended to be included in the contract and interpreting applicable statutes expansively to create obligations on insurers not originally considered when the statute was passed 
courts have also undone legal reforms passed by legislatures  which reforms were intended to reduce a litigant s rights of action or amounts recoverable and so reduce the costs borne by the insurance mechanism 
these court decisions can adversely affect an insurer s profitability 
they also create pressure on rates charged for coverages adversely affected  and this can cause a legislative response resulting in rate suppression that can adversely affect an insurer 
we may also be adversely affected by regulatory actions on matters within the jurisdiction of the various insurance departments where we do business or have entities domiciled
