overview the company s operations are grouped into three integrated and interdependent segments mountain  lodging and real estate  which represented  and  respectively  of the company s revenue for the year ended july  the mountain segment is comprised of the operations of five ski resort properties as well as ancillary businesses  primarily including ski school  dining and retail rental operations 
mountain segment revenue is seasonal in nature  the majority of which is earned in the company s second and third fiscal quarters 
operations within the lodging segment include i ownership management of a group of seven luxury hotels through the rockresorts brand  including four proximate to the company s ski resorts  ii the ownership management of non rockresorts branded hotels and condominiums proximate to the company s ski resorts  iii gtlc and iv golf courses 
the real estate segment is involved with the development of property in and around the company s resort properties 
the company s single largest source of mountain segment revenue is the sale of lift tickets including season passes  which represented approximately  and of mountain segment net revenue for the years ended july   and  respectively 
lift ticket revenue is driven by volume and pricing 
pricing is impacted by both absolute pricing as well as the demographic mix of guests  which impacts the price points at which various products are purchased 
the demographic mix of guests is divided into two primary categories i out of state and international guests destination and ii in state 
for the ski season  destination guests comprised approximately of the company s skier visits  while the in state market comprised approximately of the company s skier visits 
destination guests generally purchase the company s higher priced lift ticket products and utilize more ancillary services such as ski school  lodging and retail rental 
destination guests are less likely to be impacted by changes in the weather  due to the advance planning required for their trip  but can be impacted by the economy and the global geopolitical climate 
in state guests tend to be more weather sensitive and value oriented  to address this  the company markets season passes to in state guests  generally prior to the start of the ski season 
for the ski season  approximately of the total lift revenue was generated from the sale of season passes 
the cost structure of ski resort operations is largely fixed with the exception of certain variable expenses including forest service fees  credit card fees  retail rental operations  ski school labor and dining operations  as such  incremental revenue generally has high associated profit margin 
lodging properties at or around the company s ski resorts  which represented approximately  and of the lodging segment revenue for the years ended july   and  respectively  are closely aligned with the performance of the mountain segment  particularly with respect to visitation by destination guests 
revenue from hotel management operations under the rockresorts brand is generated through management fees based upon the revenue of the individual hotel properties within the rockresorts portfolio  and to the extent that these managed properties are not proximate to the company s ski resorts  they are more subject to the seasonality of those individual hotels and trends within the overall travel industry 
revenue of the lodging segment during the company s first and fourth fiscal quarters is generated primarily by the operations of gtlc as gtlc s peak operating season occurs during the summer months  as well as golf operations and seasonally low operations from the company s other owned and managed properties 
the company s real estate segment primarily engages in both the vertical development of projects and the sale of land to third party developers  which generally includes the retention of some involvement and control in the infrastructure  development  oversight and design of the projects and a contingent revenue structure based on the ultimate sale of the developed units 
the company attempts to mitigate the risk of vertical development by utilizing guaranteed maximum price construction contracts although certain construction costs may not be covered by contractual limitations  pre selling all or a portion of the project  requiring significant non refundable deposits and obtaining non recourse financing for certain projects 
the company s real estate development projects also may result in the creation of certain resort assets that provide additional benefit to the resort mountain and lodging segment 
the company s real estate revenue and associated expense fluctuate based upon the timing of closings and the type of real estate being sold  thus increasing the volatility of real estate operating results from period to period 
in the near term  the majority of real estate revenue is expected to be generated from vertical development projects that are currently under construction  in which revenue and related cost of sales will be recorded at the time of real estate closings 
recent trends  risks and uncertainties the data provided in this section should be read in conjunction with the risk factors identified in item a and elsewhere in this form k 
the company s management has identified the following important factors as well as uncertainties associated with such factors that could impact the company s future financial performance the timing and amount of snowfall has an impact on skier visits 
to mitigate this impact  the company focuses efforts on sales of season passes prior to the beginning of the season to in state skiers  who are the most weather sensitive visitors to the company s ski resorts 
additionally  the company has invested in snowmaking upgrades in an effort to address the inconsistency of early season snowfall where possible 
season pass revenue  although primarily collected prior to the ski season  is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations throughout the ski season 
total season pass sales for the ski season increased by over sales for the ski season 
season pass sales to date for the season indicate further favorable trends in unit sales  price increases and revenue 
however  there can be no certainty that such favorable trends will continue in the future 
consistent with prior years  the company plans to raise prices on the majority of its lift ticket products  including season pass products  for the ski season and continues to charge some of the highest prices in the industry 
while pricing increases historically have not reduced demand  there can be no assurances that demand will remain price inelastic 
the company operates its ski areas under various forest service permits  and many of the company s operations require permits and approval from governmental authorities  therefore many of the company s on mountain capital improvements must go through an approval process 
changes or impacts to the applicable regulatory environment may have detrimental effects on the company 
ownership changes of hotels under rockresorts management  or the inability of rockresorts to meet certain performance requirements for hotels under its management  may result in loss of management agreements and the related recurring management fees 
such terminations  however  may result in the payment of termination fees to rockresorts 
for the years ended july   and  the company recognized million  zero and  respectively  in revenue from termination fees 
the company continues to pursue and secure new management contracts  which may include  in addition to management fees  marketing license fees and technical service fees in conjunction with a project s development and sales

lucia  located on rodney bay  st 
lucia  in the west indies  which is anticipated to open during the company s second quarter of the year ending july  additionally  rockresorts will operate the chateau at heavenly village at the base of heavenly ski resort  and manage the new rum cay resort marina on rum cay  bahamas and the new eleven biscayne hotel spa in miami  florida  all of which are currently under construction and are anticipated to open during the years ending july  or beyond 
these agreements are generally long term in nature generally years with renewal options 
however  these agreements generally contain certain performance criteria that cover multiple years and are multi faceted 
in addition to these agreements  rockresorts will earn marketing license fees on the sales of ownership units within the rum cay resort marina and the chateau at heavenly village 
on february   an arbitrator rendered a decision  awarding million in damages in favor of rockresorts and against cheeca holdings  llc  the ownership entity of cheeca lodge spa  the former rockresorts managed property located in islamorada  florida 
additionally  in accordance with the arbitrator s ruling  rockresorts is seeking recovery of costs and attorneys fees in the last stage of the proceedings 
upon conclusion of that stage  the total award  which will incorporate the million damage award and any additional cost recovery award  is final  binding and not subject to appeal 
upon completion of the cost recovery stage  rockresorts will proceed with the collection of the award and will record the actual amount received  upon receipt  in contract dispute credit charges  net in its consolidated statement of operations

real estate reported ebitda is highly dependent on  among other things  the timing of closings on real estate under contract 
changes to the anticipated timing of closing on one or more real estate projects could materially impact real estate reported ebitda for a particular quarter or fiscal year 
additionally  the magnitude of real estate projects currently under development or contemplated could result in a significant increase in real estate reported ebitda as these projects close  expected in the year ending july  and beyond 
the profitability and or viability of current or proposed real estate development projects have been and could continue to be adversely affected by escalation in construction costs associated with project difficulties  delays  design or construction issues and scope modifications that may arise in the course of construction 
additionally  real estate development projects are also susceptible to a slow down in market demand

the company is currently in the process of completing construction and attempting to resolve the apportionment of the financial responsibilities for the remediation and construction costs with the contractors  structural engineers and architects involved in the design and construction of the jhg tc cabins  and as such the company s final costs are subject to change which could impact future operating results 
in recent years  the company has shifted its real estate focus to vertical development versus land development  which requires significant capital investment prior to project completion including the construction of resort related depreciable assets 
the company expects to incur costs of million to million subsequent to july  on significant projects under construction that include arrabelle  vail s front door  crystal peak lodge and the ritz carlton residences  vail projects 
the company has entered into non recourse financing agreements to borrow up to million for arrabelle and vail s front door and expects to enter into a non recourse financing agreement for the ritz carlton residences  vail project with similar terms as its other non recourse financing agreements 
the company had million in cash and cash equivalents as of july  which balance increased by million since july  with no borrowings under the revolver component of its credit facilities and expects to generate additional cash from operations  including future closures on real estate

subsequently  on september   the company supplemented its previous offer to acquire the canyons by agreeing to grant a interest in the future net cash flow as defined to the company arising from the ownership and development of the real estate development rights included in the acquisition 
if the company is successful in its acquisition of the canyons it could significantly impact the future results of operations of the company

destination guest visitation for the year ended july  increased on an absolute basis  including a increase for the company s colorado resorts  as well as on a percentage of total visitation increasing to from for the prior two years 
season pass revenue was up and for the years ended july  and  respectively  due to a combination of more passes sold and higher pass prices 
the kottke survey  a study undertaken annually to track key metrics within the ski industry  classifies the company s colorado resorts in its rocky mountain region  and the company s heavenly resort in its pacific west region 
visitation for the ski season increased at the company s colorado resorts as compared to for the rocky mountain region as a whole due to the strong increase in destination visitation at the company s colorado resorts in spite of a reduction in snowfall for the region and a decline in the average visitation per season pass holder due to adverse weather conditions in the denver metropolitan area 
visitation decreased at the company s heavenly resort versus a decrease in the pacific west region as a whole due in large part to significantly unfavorable weather conditions throughout the ski season  including a reduction in snowfall for the region for the season as compared to the season 
visitation at the company s colorado resorts was up for the year ended july  as compared to the year ended july  due in part to the strong early season snowfall which especially impacted visitation by season pass holders  while visitation at heavenly was down for the year ended july  due to unfavorable weather conditions  including during the christmas holiday period 
revenue from ski school improved in both the years ended july  and due to an increase in absolute pricing and higher participation as a result of the increased destination guest visitation  as ski school participation is impacted more by destination guest visitation than overall visitation 
dining revenue for the year ended july  grew commensurate with price increases  partially offset by a slight decrease in total visitation 
for the year ended july   dining experienced a lower percentage growth than the other ancillary businesses due to the reduction in revenue resulting from the conversion of certain formerly owned restaurants to leased operations and the closing of certain owned restaurants during the year ended july  due to the redevelopment in lionshead for the construction of arrabelle 
retail rental experienced a increase in revenue for the year ended july   despite being negatively impacted by adverse weather conditions  especially at the company s heavenly resort

for the year ended july   other revenue was flat primarily due to the lost recurring revenue as a result of the disposition of the company s investment in rtp offsetting increased revenues from commercial leasing and other ancillary mountain activities 
for the year ended july   other revenue increased due to higher strategic alliance incentives  increased technology service revenue and additional municipal services revenue 
mountain operating expense increased during the year ended july  compared to the year ended july  excluding retail rental expense  which has a high variable cost component and therefore increased in relation to the retail rental revenue increases  expense increased during the year ended july   which was primarily attributable to higher variable costs related to higher revenue  including forest service fees and credit card fees  and certain labor related costs  including higher ski school labor expense to support the higher ski school revenue 
expense increases were partially offset by the elimination of recurring expenses related to the company s disposal of its investment in rtp as well as lower workers compensation expense 
mountain operating expense increased for the year ended july  as compared to the previous year mainly due to higher retail rental operations resulting from increased sales volume and the ssv acquisition mentioned above as well as increased costs for stock based compensation due to the adoption of sfas r in the year ended july  excluding retail rental and stock based compensation attributable to the mountain segment  expenses increased  or million  for the year ended july   which was primarily attributable to higher variable costs related to the higher revenue  including  forest service fees  credit card fees  and certain labor related costs  including higher ski school labor expense to support the higher ski school revenue  as well as higher absolute energy costs  all of which was partially offset by lower corporate allocated costs including legal costs and sarbanes oxley compliance costs 
mountain equity investment income primarily includes the company s share of income from the operations of a real estate brokerage joint venture  the increase in equity investment income is due primarily to increased commissions earned by the brokerage associated with increased real estate activity surrounding the company s colorado resorts 
the company currently anticipates that the mountain segment in the year ending july  and beyond should continue to realize increasing revenue as a result of the company s continuing ability to raise prices as well as attract destination guests and season pass holders  absent any unforeseen material declines in the economy  elevated geopolitical uncertainties and or significant changes in historical snowfall patterns 
the expected higher visitation is due to recent industry trends and the company s high quality offerings complemented by continued capital investment including real estate development  which will expand the destination guest bed base and provide incremental resort assets 
ancillary revenue should grow commensurate with expected lift revenue growth

in addition  the company s financing arrangements  including the indenture  limit its ability to incur certain indebtedness  make certain restricted payments  enter into certain investments  make certain affiliate transfers and may limit its ability to enter into certain mergers  consolidations or sales of assets 
the company s borrowing availability under the credit facility is primarily determined by the net funded debt to adjusted ebitda ratio  which is based on the company s segment operating performance  as defined in the credit agreement 
the company was in compliance with all relevant covenants in its debt instruments as of july  the company expects it will meet all applicable financial maintenance covenants in its credit agreement  including the net funded debt to adjusted ebitda ratio throughout the year ending july  however  there can be no assurance that the company will meet such financial covenants 
if such covenants are not met  the company would be required to seek a waiver or amendment from the banks participating in the credit facility

interest payments associated with variable rate debt have not been included in the table 
assuming that the amounts outstanding under variable rate long term debt as of july  are held to maturity  and utilizing interest rates in effect at july   the company anticipates that its annual interest payments including commitment fees and letter of credit fees on variable rate long term debt as of july  will be in the range of million to million excluding interest payments of million and million to be paid in the years ending july  and  respectively  related to non recourse real estate financings for at least the next five years 
the future annual interest obligations noted herein are estimated only in relation to debt outstanding as of july   and do not reflect interest obligations on potential future debt including non recourse financing associated with real estate development 
purchase obligations include amounts which are classified as trade payables  accrued payroll and benefits  accrued fees and assessments  accrued taxes  accrued interest  contingencies  commitments to complete real estate projects on the company s consolidated balance sheet as of july  and other commitments for goods and services not yet received  including construction contracts

critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the company to select appropriate accounting policies and to make judgments and estimates affecting the application of those accounting policies 
in applying the company s accounting policies  different business conditions or the use of different assumptions may result in materially different amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the company has identified the most critical accounting policies upon which its financial status depends 
the critical principles were determined by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
the company also has other policies considered key accounting policies  however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting policies because they do not generally require the company to make estimates or judgments that are complex or subjective 
real estate revenue and cost of sales 
description the company utilizes the relative sales value method to determine cost of sales for individual parcels of real estate or condominium units sold within a project  when specific identification of costs cannot be reasonably determined 
the determination of cost of sales may utilize estimates for both the ultimate total revenue to be recognized  including the value of resort assets that may be part of a real estate development project  and total costs to be incurred on a real estate development project 
real estate development projects generally span several years 
judgments and uncertainties changes to either total projected revenue to be earned  the relative sales values of the components of a project or the total projected costs to be incurred to determine cost of sales may cause significant variances in the profit margins recognized on individual parcels within a project 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions a change in the estimates of either future revenue to be earned  the relative sales values of the components of a project or costs to be incurred for projects utilizing the relative sales value method would have changed the profit margin recognized by approximately million for the year ended july  intangible assets 
description the company frequently acquires intangible assets  including goodwill  primarily through business combinations 
the assignment of value to individual intangible assets generally requires the assistance of a specialist  such as an appraiser 
the assumptions used in the appraisal process are forward looking  and thus are subject to significant interpretation 
because individual intangible assets i may be expensed immediately upon acquisition  ii amortized over their estimated useful life  or iii not amortized  the assigned values and lives  when applicable  could have a material effect on current and future period results of operations 
further  intangibles are subject to certain judgments when evaluating impairment pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets sfas  discussed further in note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company tests goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually for impairment under sfas as of may  or whenever events may indicate a possible impairment exists 
additionally  future operating results could trigger significant future non cash impairment charges 
judgments and uncertainties the company determines fair value using current market values and widely accepted valuation techniques  including discounted cash flows and a royalty rate model 
these types of analyses require the company to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding economic factors and the future operating results of certain business operations 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions the company completed the annual impairment testing of intangible assets in the fourth quarter of the year ended july   which resulted in no impairment being recorded  using the methodology described herein 
a decrease in the estimated fair value of the goodwill and intangible assets tested would not have had a significant impact on the test results 
income taxes 
description the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each jurisdiction in which it operates 
this process requires the company to estimate the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent recovery is not likely  must establish a valuation allowance 
this assessment is complicated by the fact that the company files its tax return on a calendar year basis which is different from its fiscal year end 
as of july   the company had total deferred tax assets of million before valuation allowances and total deferred tax liabilities of million 
the deferred tax asset contains a valuation allowance representing the portion that management does not believe will be recovered from future taxable income 
management believes that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the future  primarily through the reversal of the deferred tax liabilities  to realize the benefit of the company s deferred tax assets for which valuation allowances have not been recorded against 
judgments and uncertainties the company has approximately million tax effected of nols carryforward as of july  for which it has not recorded a valuation allowance against 
the company is relying on the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and generation of future taxable income to utilize this carryforward 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions if the company were to incur substantial tax losses  the carryforward for which it has not recorded a valuation allowance against could expire without being utilized resulting in an increased tax expense in the period that the company believes that it more likely than not the carryforward will not be realized 
tax contingencies 
description the company is subject to periodic review by domestic tax authorities for audit of the company s income tax returns 
these audits generally include questions regarding the company s tax filing positions  including the amount and timing of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the exposures associated with the company s various tax filing positions  including state and local taxes  the company recorded reserves for probable exposure 
a significant amount of time may pass before a particular matter  for which the company may have established a reserve  is audited and fully resolved 
the irs has completed its exam of the company s tax returns for tax years through and has issued a report of its findings 
the examiner s primary finding is the disallowance of the company s position to remove the restrictions under section of the internal revenue code of approximately million of nols 
these restricted nols relate to fresh start accounting from the company s reorganization in the company has appealed the examiner s disallowance of these nols to the office of the appeals 
judgments and uncertainties the estimates of the company s tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainty because management must use judgment to estimate the potential exposure associated with the company s various filing positions 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions although management believes that the estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable and it has adequate reserves for its tax contingencies  actual results could differ  and the company may be exposed to increases or decreases in those reserves that could be material 
an unfavorable tax settlement could require the use of cash and could possibly result in an increased tax expense and effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement could possibly result in a reduction in the company s tax expense in the year of settlement or in future years resulting in additional cash being generated from operating activities  a reduction in the effective tax rate in the year of resolution or may require adjustments to the company s deferred tax assets  liabilities or intangible assets 
additionally  a favorable outcome could result in a reduction in taxes owed to government agencies over the next several years 
depreciable lives of assets 
description mountain and lodging operational assets  furniture  computer equipment  software and leasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset 
assets may become obsolete or require replacement before the end of their useful life in which the remaining book value would be written off or the company could incur costs to remove or dispose of assets no longer in use 
judgments and uncertainties the estimates of the company s useful life of the assets contains uncertainty because management must use judgment to estimate the useful life of the asset 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions although management believes that the estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable  actual results could differ  and the company may be exposed to increased expense related to depreciable assets disposed of  removed or taken out of service prior to its originally estimated useful life  which may be material 
a decrease in the estimated useful lives of depreciable assets would have increased depreciation expense by approximately million for the year ended july  new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of sfas no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
it also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the requirements of fin are effective for the company beginning august  its fiscal year ending july  
although the company has not completed its analysis  the company does not expect the implementation of fin will have a significant impact on its financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements  but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information 
the requirements of sfas are effective for the company beginning august  its fiscal year ending july  
the company is in the process of evaluating this guidance and therefore has not yet determined the impact that sfas will have on the company s financial position or results of operations upon adoption 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas gives the company the irrevocable option to carry many financial assets and liabilities at fair values  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
the requirements of sfas are effective for the company beginning august  its fiscal year ending july   although early adoption is permitted 
the company is in the process of evaluating this guidance and therefore has not yet determined the impact that sfas will have on the company s financial position or results of operations upon adoption 
inflation although the company cannot accurately determine the precise effect of inflation on its operations  management does not believe inflation has had a material effect on the results of operations in the last three fiscal years 
when the costs of operating resorts increase  the company generally has been able to pass the increase on to its customers 
however  there can be no assurance that increases in labor and other operating costs due to inflation will not have an impact on the company s future profitability 
seasonality and quarterly results the company s mountain and lodging operations are seasonal in nature 
in particular  revenue and profits for the company s mountain and most of its lodging operations are substantially lower and historically result in losses from late spring to late fall 
conversely  peak operating seasons for gtlc  certain managed hotel properties and the company s owned golf courses occur during the summer months while the winter season generally results in operating losses 
however  revenue and profits generated by gtlc s summer operations  management fees from those managed properties and golf operations are not sufficient to fully offset the company s off season losses from its mountain and other lodging operations 
during the year ended july   of total combined mountain and lodging revenue was earned during the second and third quarters 
therefore  the operating results for any three month period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for any subsequent quarter or for a full year see note  selected quarterly financial data  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to market risk is limited primarily to the fluctuating interest rates associated with variable rate indebtedness 
at july   the company had million of variable rate indebtedness  representing of the company s total debt outstanding  at an average interest rate during the year ended july  of 
based on variable rate borrowings outstanding as of july   a basis point or change in libor would have caused the company s annual interest payments to change by million 
the company s market risk exposure fluctuates based on changes in underlying interest rates
