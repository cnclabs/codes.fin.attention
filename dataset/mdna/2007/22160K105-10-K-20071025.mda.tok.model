item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our fiscal year ends on the sunday closest to the end of august 
fiscal years and included weeks 
fiscal year included weeks  with the extra week included in the fiscal fourth quarter 
key items for fiscal year included net sales in fiscal weeks increased over fiscal weeks  driven by an increase in comparable sales sales in warehouses open for at least one year of and the opening of new warehouses  membership fees for fiscal increased  to billion  primarily due to the increase in our annual membership fee in for our non executive members  gross margin net sales less merchandise costs as a percentage of net sales decreased basis points over the prior year  selling  general and administrative sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales increased basis points over the prior year  net income for fiscal was billion  or per diluted share  compared to billion  or per diluted share  in fiscal on february   we issued million of senior notes due march  and billion of senior notes due march  the board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from to per share in april  and we repurchased million shares of our common stock  expending approximately billion at an average cost of per share 
results of operations dollars in thousands  except per share and warehouse number data the following unusual items impacted fiscal results sales returns reserve in connection with changes to our consumer electronics returns policy  we completed a review of historical data of trends in sales returns  which indicated a longer timeframe over which returns are received than was previously estimated 
we revised our estimate of our sales returns reserve to include the longer timeframe  as well as a lower realization rate on certain returned items 
the effect of the revisions to our estimated reserve resulted in a decrease in net sales of million and a charge to gross margin of approximately million 
employee tax consequences on stock options in connection with the review of stock option grants and guidance issued by the us internal revenue service on november   the compensation committee of the board of directors approved a program intended to protect approximately  employees who are united states taxpayers from certain adverse tax consequences arising from that review 
the program involved increasing the exercise prices on certain stock options granted from to and  in turn  making payments to employees in an amount approximately equal to the increase in the exercise price 
while we are still examining the availability of similar alternatives for employees outside the united states  we recorded a charge in fiscal for the estimated amount to remedy adverse tax consequences related to stock options held and previously exercised by employees outside the united states 
in aggregate  these charges totaled million 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued excise tax refund we received a million refund  related to fiscal through fiscal  as a result of a settlement with the us internal revenue service relating to excise taxes previously paid 
deferred membership in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we performed a detailed analysis of the timing of recognition of membership fees based on each member s specific renewal date daily convention as this methodology represented an improvement over our historical method based on the period in which the fee was collected 
this review resulted in a million reduction to membership fee revenue and a corresponding increase to deferred membership fees on our consolidated balance sheet 
this adjustment includes both a change in method of applying an accounting principle to a preferable method and a correction for cumulative timing errors 
prospectively  we will account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis over the specific membership term using the daily convention 
we believe it is helpful to disclose the effects of these items for purposes of providing a meaningful comparison of our current fiscal year results to prior fiscal years  as well as provide a more representative expectation of future operating results

net sales increased billion  or to billion in fiscal a week fiscal year from billion in fiscal a week fiscal year 
the billion increase in net sales is comprised of billion from the increase in comparable warehouse sales and billion from sales at new warehouses opened during fiscal and  partially offset by the change in the reserve for estimated sales returns 
changes in prices of merchandise did not materially affect the sales increase 
gasoline sales contributed to the billion net sales growth by approximately million  with approximately million of this increase related to the increase in gasoline sales prices 
most of the comparable sales growth derived from increased amounts spent by members visiting our warehouses  while increases in frequency of shopping contributed slightly 
reported comparable sales growth includes the negative impact of cannibalization established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations 
gasoline sales did not have a material impact on comparable warehouse sales growth 
changes in foreign currencies positively impacted comparable sales by approximately million  or basis points 
in our fourth fiscal quarter  the decrease in our estimated sales returns reserve resulted in an increase to net sales of million as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal where our reserve was increased  resulting in a decrease to net sales of million 
this improvement is primarily a result of the changes to our consumer electronics returns policy implemented in the spring of vs

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the executive membership two percent reward program and increased spending by executive members  which decreased gross margin by ten basis points 
additionally  a decrease of four basis points in gross margin in our merchandise departments and warehouse ancillary businesses was primarily due to changes in the sales mix  with higher sales penetration of lower margin departments and slightly lower overall gross margins in our hardlines and softlines categories 
these decreases were partially offset by a three basis point improvement related to valuing inventories following the last in first out lifo method

of this increase  basis points were primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation  and a net basis points were due to an increase in warehouse payroll and benefits costs

the amount of interest capitalized increased in fiscal due to increased warehouse openings  contributing to the decrease in interest expense  as both interest rates and the dollar amount of projects under construction increased

of these balances  approximately million and million at september  and september   respectively  represented debit and credit card receivables  primarily related to weekend sales immediately prior to the year end close 
the increase in our most liquid assets of million to billion at september  was due primarily to the issuance of the senior notes and the cash provided by our operating activities  offset by expenditures for the repurchase of our common stock and the acquisition of property and equipment related to warehouse expansion 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled billion in fiscal compared to billion in fiscal  an increase of million

expansion plans our primary requirement for capital is the domestic and international financing of land  building and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses  plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements 
while there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review  it is management s current intention to spend approximately billion to

derivatives we have limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and use them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks 
forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms 
these forward contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting 
the aggregate notional amount  which approximates the fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at september  and september   was million and million  respectively 
the mark to market adjustment related to these contracts was million and million at september  and september   respectively 
the majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned united kingdom subsidiary  primarily to hedge us dollar merchandise inventory purchases 
effective march   we entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with our senior notes  which matured and were retired in march the swaps were designated and qualified as fair value hedges of the debt 
as the terms of the swaps matched those of the underlying hedged debt  changes in the fair value of the swaps were offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and resulted in no net earnings impact 
at september   the aggregate value of the swaps was million and was recorded in deferred income taxes and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
in march  upon maturity of the debt and expiration of the swap agreements  the aggregate fair value of the swaps was zero 
we are exposed to market risk for changes in utility commodity pricing  which we partially mitigate through the use of firm price contracts with counterparties for approximately of our locations in the us and canada 
the effects of these arrangements are not significant for any period presented 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued off balance sheet arrangements with the exception of our operating leases  we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had  or are reasonably likely to have  a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements

during fiscal  we repurchased million shares of common stock  at an average price of  totaling approximately billion 
the remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was approximately million at september  purchases are made from time to time as conditions warrant in the open market or in block purchases  or pursuant to plans under sec rule b repurchased shares are retired 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments 
we continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  merchandise inventory valuation  impairment of long lived assets  warehouse closing costs  insurance self insurance liabilities and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable 
revenue recognition we generally recognize sales  net of estimated returns  at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services 
when we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services  the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed 
we provide for estimated sales returns based on historical merchandise returns levels 
in connection with changes to our consumer electronics returns policy in the spring of  we examined operational data regarding member return patterns that had not been previously analyzed 
the data indicated a longer timeframe over which returns are received than previously used to estimate the sales return reserve 
accordingly  as previously disclosed  during fiscal we increased the reserve balance and recorded an adjustment to sales of million and a pretax charge to income of million for the related gross margin and disposition costs 
we evaluate the criteria of the financial accounting standards board fasb emerging issues task force eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions 
generally  when we are the primary obligor  subject to inventory risk  have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers  influence product or service specifications  or have several but not all of these indicators  revenue is recorded on a gross basis 
if we are not the 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above  we record the net amounts as commissions earned  which is reflected in net sales 
membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members 
we account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis  whereby membership fee revenue is recognized ratably over one year 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we performed a detailed analysis of the timing of recognition of membership fees based on each member s specific renewal date as this methodology represented an improvement over our historical method  which was based on the period in which the fee was collected 
this review resulted in a million reduction to membership fee revenue and corresponding increase to deferred membership fees on our consolidated balance sheet 
this adjustment includes both a change in method of applying an accounting principle to a preferable method and a correction for cumulative timing errors 
our executive members qualify for a reward which can be redeemed only at costco warehouses  up to a maximum of per year  on all qualified purchases made at costco 
we account for this reward as a reduction in sales  with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities 
the sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data 
merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting  and are stated using the last in  first out lifo method for substantially all us merchandise inventories 
merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first in  first out fifo method 
we believe the lifo method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues 
we record an adjustment each quarter  if necessary  for the expected annual effect of inflation  and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at fiscal year end 
at both september  and september  merchandise inventories valued at lifo approximated fifo after considering the lower of cost or market principle 
we provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales 
the provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory count  which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the fiscal year 
inventory cost  where appropriate  is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates  provided they are probable and reasonably estimable 
other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones  terms of agreement  or other systematic and rational approaches 
impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs we periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment  such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse location 
our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist  requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value 
we provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for both leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated 
a considerable amount of judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liability  particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations 
these estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets 
we make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location 
we reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change 
insurance self insurance liabilities we use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms  including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool  to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation  general liability  property damage  director and officers liability  vehicle liability and employee health care benefits 
liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated  in part  by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside experts  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
income taxes the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment  the use of estimates  and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws 
significant judgment is required in assessing  among other things  the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we determine that certain positions may be successfully challenged 
when facts and circumstances change  we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates 
we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions  nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
the nature and amount of our long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
as of september   our fixed rate long term debt included million principal amount at maturity of zero coupon convertible subordinated notes carried at million  million of senior notes carried at million  billion of senior notes carried at billion and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling million 
fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt 
we hold interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
our investment policy is to manage our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances to preserve principal and liquidity  while seeking to enhance the return on our investment portfolio through the investment of available funds 
we diversify our investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities through a combination of internal and third party investment management 
short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date 
investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations 
as the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature  if interest rates were to increase or decrease  there is no material risk of a material valuation adjustment related to these instruments 
for those instruments that are classified as available for sale  the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected within stockholder s equity in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
based on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances at september   a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately million pre tax to interest income on an annual basis 
most transactions of our foreign subsidiaries are conducted in local currencies  limiting our exposure to changes in currency rates
