item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional geographic data 
our international business and presence expose us to certain risks  such as currency  interest rate and political risks 
with respect to currency risk  we transact business in different currencies primarily through our foreign subsidiaries 
the fluctuation of currencies impacts sales and profitability 
frequently  sales and the costs associated with those sales are not denominated in the same currency 
we transacted business in approximately thirty six currencies in fiscal year compared to twenty eight currencies in fiscal year and twenty seven currencies in fiscal year the relative currency mix over the past three fiscal years was as follows fiscal year ended june  of reported revenues exchange rates revenues by currency united states dollar european euro british pound sterling australian dollar mexican peso japanese yen all other currencies  total calculated using weighted average exchange rates for the fiscal year 
the of reported revenue for all other currencies is calculated based on the weighted average twelve month exchange rates for all other currencies 
the exchange rates as of june for all other currencies represents the weighted average june exchange rates for all other currencies 
weighting is based on the twelve month fiscal year revenue for each country or region 
a increase or decrease in the value of the euro in relation to the us dollar in fiscal year  would have affected total revenues by approximately million or 
this sensitivity analysis assumes a weighted average change in the exchange rate during the year with all other variables being held constant 
this sensitivity analysis does not consider the effect of exchange rate changes on either cost of sales  operating expenses  or income taxes  and accordingly  is not necessarily an indicator of the effect of potential exchange rate changes on our net income 
we are also subject to interest rate fluctuations in foreign countries to the extent that we elect to borrow in the local foreign currency 
in the past  this has not been an issue of concern as we have the capacity to elect to borrow in other currencies with more favorable interest rates 
we will continue to evaluate the need to invest in financial instruments designed to protect against interest rate fluctuations 
finally  we are subject to  among others  those environmental and geopolitical risks  and those economic  pricing and financial risks delineated in item a  titled risk factors 
patents and trademarks we hold six patents through our jtech subsidiary 
in general  we believe that  historically  our competitive position has not been materially dependent upon patent protection 
the technology used in the design and manufacture of most of our hardware products is largely licensed or purchased from third parties 
with respect to our software products  we have historically relied on nondisclosure agreements and applicable us and foreign copyright and trademark laws for protection 
in the us and in most other countries  we believe that applicable law has provided and will continue to provide us with sufficient protection 
there are risks that third party entities  including competitors  could attempt to misappropriate our intellectual property 
given these potential risks  we have implemented procedures to monitor misappropriation of its intellectual property 
if a misappropriation is detected  we will pursue appropriate legal action  and we have done so in the past when appropriate

we also own numerous other trademarks and servicemarks 
this annual report on form k also contains trademarks  trade names and servicemarks of other companies that are the property of their respective owners 
fluctuations and customers our quarterly operating results have varied in the past and may vary in the future depending upon various factors  including the timing of new product introductions  changes in our pricing and promotion policies and those of our competitors  market acceptance of new products and enhanced versions of existing products and the capital expenditure budgets of our customers 
political uncertainty and world turmoil  created by unpredictable factors  eg  terrorist attacks  natural disasters  and the volatile and unpredictable political climate in the middle east  will continue to adversely impact travel and tourism and therefore our quarterly operating results 
historically  our business has been affected by seasonal trends 
for example  the european summer holidays tend to lower our sales volume in the european countries during our first fiscal quarter  as compared to other quarters 
we also experience a stronger than average sales volume for the retail products and services in our second fiscal quarter due to the holiday season 
additionally  with the relative slowdown in corporate buying at the beginning of the calendar year  which is our third fiscal quarter  seasonal weakness for the third quarter ending march has been experienced 
therefore  we believe that sequential quarter to quarter historic comparisons of our results are not necessarily meaningful or indicative of future performance 
no single customer accounts for or more of our consolidated revenues  nor is any material portion of our business subject to renegotiation of profits at the election of the us federal government 
during the three fiscal years ended june   we have been a party  directly and indirectly  to certain contracts with the us federal government  which contracts contained standard termination for convenience clauses 
our us government related revenue was approximately  and of our total consolidated revenue for the three fiscal years ended june    and  respectively 
we do not anticipate any material adverse financial impact if the us government elected to exercise its rights under a termination for convenience clause 
environmental matters we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and do not anticipate that environmental compliance will have a material effect on our future capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position with respect to any of our operations 
backlog we generally have a backlog of approximately two months revenue  substantially all of which is cancelable at any time before shipment of hardware and software or rendering of services 
as of june   and  the backlog totaled approximately million  million and million  respectively 
historically  only an immaterial portion of the backlog existing as of the first day of the fiscal year is not recognized in that fiscal year

item a 
risk factors there are a number of risks to which we are subject 
these risks fall roughly into one of different categories  as follows environmental and geopolitical risks 
while we do not sell our products and services directly to consumers  changes in consumer habits in response to environmental or geopolitical risks affect demand for our products and services by the hospitality and tourism industries 
our business is very sensitive to the threat of terrorism and political uncertainty 
as the hospitality and tourism industries we serve are highly sensitive to consumer sentiments caused by world events  we are very vulnerable to downturns in customer buying habits associated with the ever present threat of terrorist attacks and the uncertain political climates  such as in the middle east and parts of asia 
our business is very sensitive to environmental and health disasters 
actual or anticipated environmental disasters and epidemics  including for example  hurricanes  tsunamis  and disease  will deter and delay our customers from buying our products  as concerns about potential or anticipated instances of environmental or health disasters tend to suppress travel and tourism 
environmental disasters can also adversely affect our operations in the affected areas 
higher oil and gas prices worldwide could have a material adverse impact on the travel and tourism industries 
consumers reduce discretionary spending  such as on travel and dining  when there is a material increase in non discretionary expenses caused by a rise in oil and gas prices 
we maintain offices in certain parts of the world that are subject to economic instability  political unrest and terrorism  such as argentina  brazil and israel 
the performance of our offices in these areas will be adversely impacted if these regions become subject to economic declines  political strife or episodes of terrorism 
economic  pricing and financial risks 
we are subject to the variability of world economies 
since a substantial portion of our business is conducted in foreign countries  a downturn in the economies of foreign countries could adversely affect our financial results 
while  under certain circumstances  reliance on foreign operations can have a moderating impact as one region s improving conditions can offset another region s declining conditions  our foreign businesses nonetheless add a degree of uncertainty to the planning and forecasting process 
our quarterly financial results are dependent upon the timing and size of customer orders and the shipment of products for large orders 
large software orders from customers may account for more than an insignificant portion of earnings in any quarter 
we expect the customers with whom we do the largest amount of business to vary from year to year as a result of the timing of the rollout of each customer s system 
further  if a customer delays or accelerates its delivery requirements  or if a product s completion is delayed or accelerated  revenues that we may have expected in a given quarter could be deferred or accelerated into subsequent or earlier quarters  respectively 
these events could have a meaningful effect on our quarterly results 
our ability to establish pricing is subject to rapidly changing market and competitive conditions 
to be competitive and to avoid losing business on the basis of price  we must evaluate our pricing routinely 
there are instances where we may have to reduce our pricing to win business 
these market forces have and will continue to place pressure on our gross margins and overall profitability 
our gross margins will vary from quarter to quarter based upon product mix 
product mix can affect our operating results 
for example  as we enjoy a higher gross margin on software than on hardware  our overall gross margin will vary depending upon the percentage of software licensed and the percentage of hardware sold each quarter 
given the fact that the actual product mix is difficult to predict each quarter with accuracy  there is uncertainty and variability as to the projected gross margin on a quarter to quarter basis 
our non major account business is difficult to predict 
our major account customers generally those customers who operate or more locations have longer sales cycles and deployments  our non major account sales have much shorter sales cycles and shorter deployments 
as a significant portion of our business is non major account business  there is inherent difficulty in accurately predicting buying patterns and  accordingly  it is much harder to appropriately staff and prepare for fluctuations in buying demand 
this can result in inefficiencies that adversely affect our operating results 
some of the advanced systems we sell are very complex and require a high level of technical sophistication  which may result in increased costs that adversely affect our operating results 
the costs of the implementation and operation of an effective service structure capable of servicing increasingly complex software systems in more remote locations is high and may require us to engage contractors  who generally have a higher cost structure than employees 
the additional costs are also driven by the complexity of open systems  which generally incorporate third party software products the support and service of which may be more difficult and costly  and difficulty in implementing  operating  and maintaining and supporting centrally hosted systems  such as central reservation systems  and centrally hosted property management systems and reporting systems 
we are subject to certain material cost increases that could become out of our control 
while we attempt to control third party costs  we have little or no control over certain material expenses  such as health care costs which are experience based  compliance with new legislation  and rising oil and gas prices 
significant increases in any of these expenses could adversely affect our operating results 
we are subject to fluctuations in foreign currencies and exchange rates 
as we conduct significant portions of our business in foreign currencies  we experience both sequential and year to year deviations in exchange rates that can have a significant impact on our reported results 
for example  as much of our european business is transacted in euros  our revenue on a consolidated basis will decline if the euro weakens relative to the us dollar and increase if the euro strengthens relative to the us dollar 
as a publicly traded company  our stock price is subject to certain market gyrations that are out of our control and that have nothing to do with our actual operating performance 
we can experience short term surges and declines in our stock price due to factors other than those specific to our business  such as economic news or other events generally affecting the trading markets 
technology risks 
our customers requirements are increasingly sophisticated 
for us to be able to continue to offer competitive products and to meet our customers requirements  we must continually develop and update our products 
unexpected costs and delays in development and implementation  and balancing our commitments to various customers  could adversely affect our financial results 
the development of software is an inherently difficult process that may result in software bugs that adversely impact a customer s business 
while we have a testing and beta program and protocol that we implement before the general release of any product  such processes cannot guarantee that the released software will not have any bugs 
our business could be adversely affected if these problems are significant 
the manufacturing of our hardware platform is performed primarily by ges  a company in singapore 
while we believe we have a very good relationship with ges  and while we have not experienced any material manufacturing problems with ges  there are no guarantees that ges will not experience labor or manufacturing challenges in the future 
additionally  ges procures many of its components from other third parties who could experience manufacturing or labor issues 
such difficulties could interrupt ges s supply of products to us  which would adversely affect our business 
large customized deployments may be difficult and may result in cost overruns that are not recoverable 
we have certain contracts under which we are required to provide systems and services at a fixed price 
we may be contractually required to absorb costs that may not be recoverable if we underestimate the amount of work required or if we encounter unanticipated technical issues 
this is always a risk given the complexity of some of the systems we install and the ever increasing size and scope of some of the deployments 
these unanticipated costs could adversely affect our operations 
changes in technology may result in our investing in certain technologies that become obsolete  or may result in our delaying investing in technologies to our detriment 
as we invest significantly in research and development  there is an ever present risk that we will pursue technology that we ultimately determine is not marketable or does not achieve the desired solution 
in such an event  we may be required to write off our investment which would have an adverse impact on our operating income 
actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our software products may result in reduced sales or liabilities 
as our software is used in connecting with processing sensitive data eg  credit card numbers  and is sometimes used to store such data  it may be possible for the data to be compromised if our customer does not maintain appropriate security procedures 
in those instances  the customer may attempt to seek damages from us 
while we believe that all of our current software complies with applicable industry security requirements  and while we believe we use appropriate security measures to reduce the possibility of breach through our support and other systems  we cannot assure that our customer s systems cannot be breached  nor that all unauthorized access can be prevented 
if a customer  or other person  seeks redress from us as a result of a security breach  our business could be adversely affected 
resource and personnel risks 
we could be adversely affected by vendor labor difficulties 
as some of our vendors have employees who are protected by certain labor laws or who may be members of unions  we could experience unanticipated manufacturing or supply shortages if any of our key vendors are impacted by labor difficulties or work slow downs or stoppages 
our inability to hire or our delay in hiring qualified personnel could adversely impact our ability to satisfy customers needs and our ability to maintain appropriate internal controls 
finding qualified technical personnel where our research and development facilities are located is an ongoing challenge 
if we cannot find appropriate personnel  we risk delays in satisfying customer demands  or may even lose the opportunity to provide software to the customer 
if we are required to retain a consultant because we do not have available personnel  the costs of providing development would increase 
further  any delays we may experience in recruiting and retaining qualified accounting and auditing staff could result in additional third party accounting and auditing costs and expenses 
in general  our inability to recruit and retain appropriate personnel would adversely affect our business 
legal and accounting risks 
although we attempt to protect our proprietary technology  these protections will not preclude competitors from developing products with features similar to our products 
we cannot guarantee that we can effectively preserve the uniqueness and proprietary nature of our products  despite our efforts to do so through a combination of trade secrets  copyright  trademark law  non disclosure agreements  and technical measures  others could attempt to copy what we have developed  either through legal or illegal means 
moreover  others have been able to develop competitive products and services that do not violate our proprietary rights 
we are subject to litigation  which may be costly 
as a company that does business with many customers  employees and vendors throughout the world  we are subject to legal and administrative claims  cases  proceedings  settlements  and investigations  including claims made by or against us relating to intellectual property rights and intellectual property licenses 
while we continue to police these matters  and take steps to reduce the likelihood that these matters will arise  litigation is very commonplace and could have an adverse effect on our business 
we are subject to claims by others that we are infringing their intellectual property rights 
from time to time we receive unsolicited letters from entities which suggest or assert that we may be infringing a patent 
in those instances  we will assess the validity of the claims and the purported patent  and determine whether a license is appropriate or necessary 
if we conclude that a license is not necessary  there is a risk that we will be sued  we also face indirect liability as a result of infringement claims brought against our customers 
there is at least one action pending in which some of our customers have been sued on such a claim and with respect to which some of our customers are or may be seeking indemnification from us 
while we have no reason to believe that any of our products and services infringe any patents  there can be no guarantees that we will not become involved in infringement matters  and we could as a result incur significant legal expenses and  if we are liable  significant damages 
credit card issuers have promulgated credit card security guidelines as part of their ongoing effort to battle identity theft and credit card fraud 
we continue to work with credit card issuers to assure that our products and services comply with the credit card associations security regulations and best practices applicable to our products and services 
there can be no assurances  however  that our products and services are invulnerable to unauthorized access or hacking 
additionally  there can be no guarantee that our customers will implement all of the credit card security features that we introduce  or all of the protections and procedures required by the credit card issuers  or that our customers will establish and maintain appropriate levels of firewall protection and other security measures 
when there is unauthorized access to credit card data that results in financial loss  there is a potential that parties could seek damages from us 
additionally  changes in the security guidelines could require significant and unanticipated development efforts 
we may have additional tax liabilities 
we are subject to income and sales taxes in the united states and all of the other countries in which we conduct business 
additionally  we may be subject to certain tariffs imposed by the world trade organization and other governing bodies designed to tax us imports 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
this determination is highly complex and requires detailed analysis of the available information and applicable statutes and regulatory materials 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we are regularly under audit by tax authorities 
although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable  the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
if we receive an adverse ruling during an audit  or we unilaterally determine that we have misinterpreted provisions of the myriad tax regulations to which we are subject  there could be a material effect on our income tax provision  net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 
if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a charge to earnings 
under generally accepted accounting principles  we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually 
factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable and therefore need to be reduced or written off altogether include a decline in stock price and market capitalization  reduced future cash flow or growth estimates  and reduction in use or discontinuation of the purchased products 
if we determine that there is an impairment  we are required to record a charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined 
this charge will correspondingly reduce our results of operations  perhaps materially

item legal proceedings we are and have been involved in legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business 
in addition  the holder of an expired patent has commenced litigation against approximately individual retailers  of whom are our customers for retail point of sale software 
the case is styled ware v 
abercrombie fitch stores  inc  et al  civil action no 
cv rlv  and was filed in the united states district court for the northern district of georgia on june  the patent alleged to have been infringed is us patent no 
 although the complaint has not yet been served on the defendants  some of the defendants who are our customers have advised that they will seek indemnification from us under contract provisions for the defense of that action 
currently  there are two active separate requests for reconsideration of the patent which have been filed with the us patent and trademark office 
should the case proceed  and if it is determined that we are obligated to indemnify any of our customers who are defendants in the action  then we will vigorously defend the action and assert all defenses and arguments available to us 
in any event  based on currently available information and analysis by patent counsel  we do not believe that our products infringe the patent 
subject to the foregoing  we are of the opinion  based upon presently available information and the advice of litigation counsel concerning pertinent legal matters  that any resulting liability should not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows

as detailed elsewhere in this report on form k  our enterprise solutions comprise three major areas hotel information systems  restaurant information systems  and specialty retail information systems 
we also offer a wide range of related services 
we distribute our products and services directly and through a network of independent dealers and distributors 
the markets in which we operate are highly competitive 
we compete on various bases  including product functionality  service capabilities  price  and geography 
we believe that our competitive strengths include our established global distribution and service network  our ability to offer a broad array of hardware  software and service products to the hospitality and retail industry and our corporate focus on providing specialized information systems solutions 
we are organized and operate in four operating segments us  europe  the pacific rim and latin america regions 
as the products and services for all new business acquisitions are all similar to those ours  the new business acquisitions have been incorporated into the existing four operating segments based on their respective geographical locations  and operated and managed as a part of that operating segment 
for the purposes of applying sfas no 
 we have identified us as a separate reportable segment and has aggregated our three international operating segments into one reportable segment  international  as the three international operating segments share many similar economical characteristics 
the management views the us and international segments separately in operating its business  although the products and services are similar for each segment 
we continue to see overall growth in the hospitality and retail industries  slower growth in some sectors has historically tended to be offset by faster growth in other areas 
we have seen particular growth in our quick service restaurant business  including that generated by sales to various quick service restaurant chains with whom we have announced alliances 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those that impact revenue recognition  share based compensation  capitalized software  intangible assets  allowance for doubtful accounts  allowance for obsolescence  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following comprise the critical accounting estimates that we used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is generated from software licenses  hardware and service and support 
revenue is recognized in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as modified by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions and the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
revenue under multiple element arrangements  which typically include hardware  software licenses  and maintenance agreements sold together  are allocated to each element in the arrangement using the residual method prescribed by sop  based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of any undelivered elements of the arrangement  ie  an allocated portion of revenue is deferred from the arrangement  equivalent to the fair value of undelivered elements 
revenue from software license  hardware and service and support are generally recognized when the four basic criteria of sop are met as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists we require a contract signed by both parties to the agreement or a purchase order received from the customer as persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
delivery has occurred or services have been rendered delivery occurs at fob shipping point when provided to a common carrier  if the risk of ownership has passed to the buyer or in the case of electronic delivery  delivery occurs when the customer is given access to the licensed programs 
if the risk of ownership has not passed to the buyer when provided to the common carrier  delivery occurs when the risk has passed to the buyer 
fixed or determinable fee we consider the license fee to be fixed or determinable if the fee is not subject to refund or adjustment and is payable within twelve months of delivery with generally no more than of the contract price due at the end of the payment term 
if the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize the revenue as amounts become due and payable 
we consider service fees to be fixed or determinable if the service fee or rates for time and material contracts are not subject to refund or adjustment 
collection is probable we perform a credit review for significant transactions at the time the arrangement is executed to determine the credit worthiness of the customer 
collection is deemed probable if we expect that the customer will be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as they become due 
if we determine from the outset of an arrangement that collection is not probable  revenue is recognized as collection occurs 
costs related to shipping and handling and billable travel expenses are included in cost of sales 
the revenue is reduced for estimated customer returns and allowances 
since our revenue deferral for undelivered elements under multiple element arrangements is based on vsoe of the fair value of any undelivered elements of the arrangement  our financial results for current fiscal year and future periods could be significantly different if our estimates of the vsoe of the fair values of undelivered elements change 
additionally  significant differences in the actual customer returns and allowances to our estimates could also significantly affect our financial results 
share based compensation we account for our option awards granted under the stock option program in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
r  share based payment  which became effective july  for us 
we adopted the modified prospective application transition method  which did not result in restatement of previously issued financial statements 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  the estimated fair value of awards granted after the effective date of sfas no 
r are measured  and non cash share based compensation expense adjusted for expected pre vesting forfeitures are recognized ratably over the requisite service period of options in the consolidated statement of operations 
in addition  non cash share based compensation expense adjusted for expected pre vesting forfeitures is recognized for the non vested portion of awards that were granted before the effective date of sfas no 
r as those options become incrementally vested 
as we value stock options using the black scholes option pricing model  which was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that are fully transferable and have no vesting restrictions  we are required to input highly subjective assumptions about volatility rates  expected term of options  and applicable interest rates in the option pricing model 
expected volatility is based on historical stock prices 
the expected term of options granted is based on historical option activities  adjusted for the remaining option life cycle by assuming ratable exercise of any unexercised vested options over the remaining term 
for this  we separate groups of employees that have historically exhibited similar behavior with regard to option exercises and post vesting cancellations 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
total expense recorded in any period can be significantly different depending on several variables  including any changes to these assumptions  especially the number of share based awards that vest  pre vesting cancellations  and the estimated fair value of those vested awards 
inventory inventory is stated at the lower of standard cost  which approximates cost  or market 
standard cost is determined principally by the first in  first out pricing method 
we maintain a reserve for obsolescence for inventory in the amount of approximately million as of june  and allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments and for limited circumstances when the customer disputes the amounts due to us 
our methodology for determining this allowance requires estimates and is based on the age of the receivable  customer payment practices and history  inquiries  credit reports from third parties and other financial information 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowance may be required which could affect our financial results in future periods

capitalized software development costs costs incurred in the research and development of new software products to be licensed to others  costs primarily consisting of salaries  employee benefits and administrative costs  are expensed as incurred and included in research and development expenses until technological feasibility is established 
the capitalization of software development costs on a product by product basis starts when a product s technological feasibility has been established and the capitalization stops when the product is available for general release to customers  at which time amortization begins 
technological feasibility is established when the product reaches the working model stage 
the cost of purchased software is also capitalized 
annual amortization of capitalized software development costs are charged to software cost of sales  and is the greater of the amount computed using the ratio that each capitalized software product s current fiscal year gross revenue is to the total of current fiscal year and anticipated future gross revenues for that product  or the amortization based on straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product 
if we incorrectly estimate the remaining economic life of a product or the anticipated future gross revenues of a product  our future financial results could be materially affected if the unamortized costs are written off or if the amortization is accelerated 
amortization expense for the fiscal years  and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
additionally  during the fiscal year  we wrote off approximately million in capitalized software costs related to products for which no future revenue was projected 
long lived assets including finite lived purchased intangible assets we evaluate long lived assets  including finite lived purchased intangible assets  for impairment whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
when indicators of impairment are present  we compare the fair value of the assets  based on the undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate  to the book value of the assets 
if the fair value is less than book value  the asset is impaired and we recognize an impairment loss 
the impairment loss represents the excess of book value over fair value based on a discounted cash flow approach or market values  if available 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of long lived assets including finite lived purchased intangible assets is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
in estimating the fair value of the assets for the purposes of our analyses  we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of these assets 
the cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the company 
a determination that assets are impaired could result in a significant charge in future periods 
goodwill and indefinite lived purchased intangible assets sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  prohibits the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived purchased intangible assets 
we assess whether goodwill and our only indefinite lived purchased intangible assets  trademarks  are impaired in accordance with sfas no 
on an annual basis  during the first quarter of each fiscal year 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit the company s four operating segments consisting of us  europe  the pacific rim and latin america to its book value 
the fair value of each reporting unit is determined based on a weighting of the income approach ie  discounted future income flow and market approach ie  evaluating against the purchase and sale of comparable assets in the relevant industry to value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the book value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is not impaired 
if goodwill is impaired  we recognize an impairment loss based on the amount by which the book value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole  as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the purchase price were being initially allocated 
trademarks are evaluated for impairment by comparing their fair value to book value 
we estimate the fair value of trademarks using an income approach to value  and recognize an impairment loss if the estimated fair value of a trademark is less than its book value 
additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that  more likely than not  the book value of goodwill and or trademarks has been impaired 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and or trademarks is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
in estimating the fair value of the reporting units with recognized goodwill for the purposes of our annual or periodic analyses  we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of these businesses 
the cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying reporting units 
we also consider our market capitalization on the date the analysis is performed 
a determination that goodwill or intangible assets are impaired could result in a significant charge in future periods 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on the deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not to be realized 
if we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period in which the determination is made

software cost of sales as a percent of related revenue increased primarily due to a decrease in the third party software margin percentage compared to fiscal year additionally  the revenue from the opera suite of products was comparable to fiscal year  but represented a lower percentage of total software revenue 
because the opera suite of products generates much higher margins than our third party software  this product mix change had the impact of increasing the overall software cost of sales as a percent of related revenue 
service cost of sales as a percent of related revenue decreased primarily due to a decrease in travel expenses and maintenance service part costs 
the decreases in travel expenses and parts costs were partially offset by an increase in overall service labor costs resulting mainly from higher than average service labor costs associated with some of our newly acquired subsidiaries

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk and to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
see part i  item i  foreign sales and foreign market risks  and part ii  item for information regarding foreign currency exchange risks 
the company s committed lines of credit bear interest at a floating rate  which exposes the company to interest rate risks 
the company manages its exposure to this risk by minimizing  to the extent feasible  overall borrowing and monitoring available financing alternatives 
the company s interest rate risk has not changed materially from june   and the company does not foresee any significant changes in exposure or in how it manages this exposure in the near future 
at june   the company had total borrowings of approximately million  and had not entered into any instruments to hedge the resulting exposure to interest rate risk 
management believes that the fair value of the debt equals its carrying value at june  and june  the company s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates will increase or decrease in the future with increases or decreases in the outstanding amount under the line of credit 
as the company s total borrowing as of june  was approximately million  a change in interest rate would have resulted in an immaterial impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
to minimize the company s exposure to credit risk associated with financial instruments  the company places its temporary cash investments with high credit quality institutions  generally with bond rating of a and above
