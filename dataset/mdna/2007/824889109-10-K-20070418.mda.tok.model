item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements included in part ii  item of this report 
overview shoe carnival  inc is one of the nation s largest family footwear retailers 
as of february   we operated stores in states primarily in the midwest  south and southeast regions of the united states 
we offer a distinctive shopping experience  a broad merchandise assortment and value to our customers while maintaining an efficient store level cost structure 
our stores combine competitive pricing with a highly promotional  in store marketing effort that encourages customer participation and creates a fun and exciting shopping experience 
we believe this highly promotional atmosphere results in various competitive advantages  including increased multiple unit sales  the building of a loyal  repeat customer base  the creation of word of mouth advertising  and enhanced sell through of in season goods 
our objective is to be the destination store of choice for a wide range of consumers seeking moderately priced  current season name brand and private label footwear 
our product assortment includes dress and casual shoes  sandals  boots and a wide assortment of athletic shoes for the entire family 
we believe that by offering a wide selection of both athletic and non athletic footwear  we are able to reduce our exposure to shifts in fashion preferences between those categories 
our ability to identify and react to fashion changes is a key factor in our sales and earnings performance 
our marketing effort targets middle income  value conscious consumers seeking name brand footwear for all age groups 
we believe that by offering a wide selection of popular styles of name brand merchandise at competitive prices  we generate broad customer appeal 
our cost efficient store operations and real estate strategy enable us to price products competitively and earn attractive store level returns 
low labor costs are achieved by housing merchandise directly on the selling floor in an open stock format  enabling customers who choose to serve themselves 
this reduces the staffing required to assist customers and reduces store level labor costs as a percentage of sales 
we locate stores predominantly in strip shopping centers in order to take advantage of lower occupancy costs and maximize our exposure to value oriented shoppers 
our fiscal year is a week year ending on the saturday closest to january unless otherwise stated  references to years     and relate respectively to the fiscal years ended february   january   january   january   and february  fiscal year consisted of weeks and the other fiscal years consisted of weeks 
critical accounting policies it is necessary for us to include certain judgements in our reported financial results 
these judgements involve estimates that are inherently uncertain and actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
the accounting policies that require the more significant judgements are merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
in determining market value  we estimate the future sales price of items of merchandise contained in the inventory as of the balance sheet date 
factors considered in this determination include  among others  current and recently recorded sales prices  the length of time product has been held in inventory and quantities of various product styles contained in inventory 
the ultimate amount realized from the sale of certain product could differ materially from our estimates 
we also estimate a shrinkage reserve for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date 
the estimate for the shrinkage reserve can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shrinkage trends 
valuation of long lived assets we review long lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable and annually when no such event has occurred 
we evaluate the ongoing value of assets associated with retail stores that have been open longer than one year 
when events such as these occur  the assets subject to impairment are adjusted to estimated fair value and  if applicable  an impairment loss is recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
our assumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of impairment  including current and future economic trends for stores  are subject to a high degree of judgement and if actual results or market conditions differ from those anticipated  additional losses may be recorded 
income taxes we calculate income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the use of the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates in effect in the years when those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
inherent in the measurement of these deferred balances are certain judgements and interpretations of existing tax law and other published guidance as applied to our operations 
tax reserves have been established  which we believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments 
once established  reserves are adjusted only when more information becomes available or when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves 
our effective tax rate considers our judgement of expected tax liabilities in the various taxing jurisdictions within which we are subject to tax 
we have also been involved in tax audits 
at any given time  multiple tax years are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
outlook we anticipate opening between and new stores and closing three stores during fiscal these new stores will be located in large and small markets primarily within our existing geographic areas 
our intention is to back fill under penetrated larger markets with additional stores  thereby increasing the performance of the overall market 
we believe the following key infrastructure enhancements initiated in fiscal will support our accelerated growth strategy in fiscal and beyond 
new distribution center during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we opened a new  square foot distribution center 
we are leasing the land  building and improvements for an initial period of years 
the conversion to this new facility was completed in the first quarter of fiscal the new distribution center  utilizing state of the art processing and product movement equipment  can support the processing and distribution needs of approximately stores 
the facility was designed to be expanded and will ultimately provide us with the processing and storage capacity to support a total of approximately stores 
new corporate headquarters construction on our new corporate headquarters is expected to be completed in the second quarter of fiscal the  square foot leased facility is designed to meet our specific business needs and has capacity to accommodate additional administrative personnel as we grow our store base 
the new corporate headquarters marks an important milestone in our history and serves as a visible sign of our commitment to the ongoing growth and development of the company 
during  our projected investment in furniture and fixtures for the new facility will be approximately million 
information technology in fiscal  we substantially completed the chain wide implementation of a wide area network the wan 
the wan has enabled us to achieve immediate operational enhancements and cost savings in a number of areas by providing improved connectivity between our corporate headquarters  new distribution center and store locations 
the immediate benefits of the wan included a reduction in the amount of time required to authorize settlement transactions and a reduction in debit and credit card fees 
we expect the wan to continue to provide improvements in connectivity and enhanced support of new applications in fiscal and beyond 
these new applications include a time and attendance payroll system that was substantially complete in fiscal and an inventory locator system we expect to implement in fiscal markdown optimization software in late spring of  we completed our implementation of oracle s retail price optimization solution price optimization 
price optimization is a sophisticated analytical software program that helps our buyers manage in season pricing and markdowns  taking into account the historical lifecycle of the various product categories and the effect of the various promotions we run 
through enhanced management of product markdowns  we expect to improve inventory turnover  keep our seasonal product fresh and ultimately improve our gross profit margin 
price optimization also provides a platform for zone pricing which allows us to price an item differently in each zone based on the item s sell through 
although we believe that the benefit of price optimization was minimal to the results for  we expect to see improvements to our profit margin in fiscal as the software becomes more integrated with our merchandise processes 
results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales for the following fiscal years net sales cost of sales including buying  distribution and occupancy costs gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest income interest expense income before income taxes income tax expense net income compared to net sales in the regular course of business  we offer our customers sales incentives including coupons  discounts  and free merchandise 
sales are recorded net of such incentives and returns and allowances 
if an incentive involves free merchandise  that merchandise is recorded as a zero sale and the cost is included in cost of sales 
comparable store sales for the periods indicated include stores that have been open for full months prior to the beginning of the period  including those stores that have been relocated or remodeled 
therefore  stores opened or closed during the periods indicated are not included in comparable store sales 
net sales increased million to million in fiscal  a increase over net sales of million in fiscal fiscal consisted of weeks compared to weeks in fiscal sales of approximately million were recorded in the extra week of fiscal comparable store sales for the week period ended january  increased  or approximately million 
the remaining increase was primarily related to sales generated by our new stores partially offset by the sales decrease resulting from store closings 
comparable store sales for the week period ended january  increased for non athletic merchandise and decreased for athletic product 
we attribute the sales decline in athletic product to the current fashion trends favoring dress and casual styles over that of traditional athletic 
we made significant progress in fiscal towards our goal of increasing women s casual and dress product as a percent of total sales 
historically  women s non athletic product has achieved the highest gross profit margin of any of our footwear categories 
our long term goal is to achieve total sales of to percent in women s dress and casual merchandise 
for fiscal  our women s non athletic product rose to of total sales compared to in fiscal as we look forward to fiscal  our focus will remain on increasing our brand recognition  as well as focusing on the fashion aspect of our business to drive comparable store sales gains through a combination of increased unit sales and growth in average selling prices 
gross profit gross profit increased million to million in fiscal  a increase from gross profit of million in fiscal the gross profit margin for fiscal increased to from in fiscal as a percentage of sales  the merchandise margin increased and buying  distribution and occupancy costs increased 
the increase in merchandise margin  as a percentage of sales  was primarily driven by our continued improvements in inventory management and product assortment which resulted in an increase in average selling price 
the increase in buying  distribution and occupancy costs  as a percentage of sales  was due primarily to incremental expenses of approximately  associated with the opening of a new distribution center during the fourth quarter of fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses during fiscal  as a percentage of sales  decreased to from in fiscal significant changes in expenses included a  increase in stock based compensation and a  decrease in health care costs 
disclosure regarding our stock based compensation plans and the effect of the adoption of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  is contained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii  item of this report 
health care costs incurred during fiscal were unusually high and we believe we experienced a return to a more normal usage of benefits in fiscal additionally  at the beginning of our third quarter of fiscal  we entered into an agreement with a new provider to manage our self insured health benefits plan 
this resulted in year over year savings on claim management fees and preferred provider discounts 
the portion of store closing costs included in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal was  or as a percentage of sales 
these costs related to six fiscal store closings and an impairment charge for one store expected to be closed in fiscal in fiscal  we incurred million  or as a percentage of sales  in store closing costs related to seven fiscal store closings and impairment charges for three of the stores that closed in fiscal the year over year decrease was primarily attributable to the impairment charges we recorded in fiscal for the three stores we closed in fiscal the timing and actual amount of expense recorded in closing a store can vary significantly on a store by store basis depending  in part  on the period in which management commits to a closing plan  the remaining basis in the fixed assets at the store and any amounts required to be paid as part of the lease termination 
pre opening expenses for the new stores in fiscal and the new stores in fiscal were approximately  and  respectively 
pre opening expenses represented of sales for both years 
pre opening costs  such as advertising  payroll and supplies  incurred prior to the opening of a new store are charged to expense in the period they are incurred 
our average pre opening costs per store dropped by nearly in fiscal to  from  in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to changes in the mix of advertising media selected to advertise our openings and an increase in vendor cooperative advertising funds 
interest income and expense interest income increased to million in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase was attributable to higher average cash and cash equivalents balances available for investment purposes throughout fiscal interest expense decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the decrease was attributable to the effect of no direct borrowings being incurred during fiscal income taxes the effective income tax rate was for fiscal and in fiscal the effective income tax rate for both years differed from the statutory rate due primarily to state and local income taxes  net of the federal tax benefit 
compared to net sales net sales increased million to million in fiscal  an increase over net sales of million in fiscal of the increase  million was attributable to the sales generated by the stores opened in fiscal and the effect of a full year s worth of sales for the stores opened in fiscal  but was partially offset by seven store closings 
the balance of the increase was attributable to a comparable store sales increase of 
in the last half of fiscal  we undertook two initiatives 
the first was to enhance the fashion content of our men s and women s non athletic product and the second was to improve the way in which we advertise to our customers 
the record comparable store sales gain for fiscal was due to the results achieved in both our women s and men s non athletic business 
our men s non athletic product had a comparable store sales increase of 
our women s non athletic product had an even greater comparable store sales increase of 
gross profit our gross profit increased million to million in fiscal  a increase from a gross profit of million in fiscal our gross profit margin  as a percentage of sales  rose to for fiscal as compared to for fiscal as a percentage of sales  the merchandise margin increased and buying  distribution and occupancy costs decreased 
the decrease in buying  distribution and occupancy costs  as a percentage of sales  was due primarily to leveraging occupancy costs against a higher sales base 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal approximately million of this increase was directly attributable to operating the new stores opened in fiscal and fiscal net of seven store closings in fiscal 
we also incurred an increase of million in health care costs and an increase of million for incentive compensation in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in incentive compensation was primarily a result of higher operating earnings  which is the major component of our performance based incentive plans 
as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal from the prior year at 
this percentage decrease was primarily due to leveraging expenses against a larger sales base 
however  this leveraging was partially offset by a increase in employee healthcare and a increase in incentive compensation  both as a percentage of sales 
the increase in incentive compensation as a percentage of sales was primarily a result of higher operating earnings  which is the major component of our performance based incentive plans currently in place 
during fiscal  we incurred million in store closing costs related to seven fiscal store closings and impairment charges for three stores that were closed in fiscal in fiscal  we incurred  in store closing costs for six stores that were closed in fiscal and fiscal the year over year increase was primarily attributable to impairment charges for three stores that were closed in fiscal the aggregate of pre opening expenses for the new stores in fiscal was approximately  or of sales  and was million  or of sales  for the new stores in fiscal our average pre opening costs per store dropped by nearly in fiscal to  from  in fiscal approximately of this decrease was due to an increase in cooperative advertising dollars received from our vendors and differences in advertising costs in markets where we have opened new stores 
interest income and expense interest income increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase was attributable to a higher average cash and cash equivalent balance available for investment purposes throughout fiscal interest expense decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the decrease was attributable to the effect of lower average borrowings incurred during fiscal income taxes the effective income tax rate was for fiscal and in fiscal the effective income tax rate for both years differed from the statutory rate due primarily to state and local income taxes  net of the federal tax benefit 
liquidity and capital resources our sources and uses of cash are summarized as follows s fiscal years net income plus depreciation and amortization   deferred income taxes   lease incentives changes in operating assets and liabilities  other operating activities    net cash provided by operating activities    net cash used in investing activities    net cash provided by used in financing activities   net increase in cash and cash equivalents   our primary sources of funds are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for fiscal these amounts reflect the income from operations adjusted for non cash items and working capital changes 
the million decrease in cash provided by operating activities between the two respective periods related primarily to higher merchandise inventories at february   partially offset by the increase in net income and stock based compensation between years 
this increase in inventories was mainly due to an increase in store openings and the timing of receipts for the easter selling season compared to last year 
working capital increased to million at february  from million at january   primarily from a million increase in cash and cash equivalents and a million increase in merchandise inventories 
this increase was partially offset by the increases in accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities 
the current ratio at february  was as compared to at january  we had no outstanding long term debt at february  or january  capital expenditures were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal no capital lease obligations were incurred during this three year period 
of the fiscal capital expenditures  approximately million was incurred to equip the new distribution center  million for new stores  million for store remodeling and relocations  and million for software and information technology 
lease incentives received from landlords were   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
capital expenditures are expected to be million to million in fiscal of this amount  approximately million represents equipment for the new distribution center and million represents our projected investment in furniture and fixtures for our new corporate headquarters 
we intend to open to stores at an expected aggregate cost of between million and million in fiscal the remaining capital expenditures are expected to be incurred for store remodels  visual presentation enhancements and various other store improvements  along with continued investments in technology and normal asset replacement activities 
the actual amount of cash required for capital expenditures for store operations depends in part on the number of new stores opened  the amount of lease incentives  if any  received from landlords and the number of stores remodeled 
the opening of new stores will be dependent upon  among other things  the availability of desirable locations  the negotiation of acceptable lease terms and general economic and business conditions affecting consumer spending in areas we target for expansion 
our current store prototype uses between  and  square feet depending upon  among other factors  the location of the store and the population base the store is expected to service 
capital expenditures for a new store in fiscal are expected to average approximately  the average inventory investment in a new store is expected to range from  to  depending on the size and sales expectation of the store and the timing of the new store opening 
pre opening expenses  such as advertising  salaries and supplies  are expected to average approximately  per store in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal on a per store basis  for the stores opened during fiscal  the initial inventory investment averaged  capital expenditures averaged  and lease incentives received from landlords averaged  significant contractual obligations as of february  and the periods in which payments are due include s payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years letters of credit   operating leases      purchase commitments   deferred compensation   total contractual obligations     our unsecured credit facility provides for up to million in cash advances on a revolving basis and commercial letters of credit 
borrowings under the revolving credit line are based on eligible inventory 
the agreement governing the credit facility stipulates a minimum threshold for net worth  a maximum ratio of funded debt plus rent to ebitda plus rent  and a maximum of total distributions for stock repurchases and cash dividends 
we were in compliance with these requirements as of february  should a default condition be reported  the lenders may preclude additional borrowings and call all loans and accrued interest at their discretion 
the credit agreement and amendments thereto are filed as exhibits to or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and letters of credit outstanding were million at february  estimated interest payments on our line of credit are not included in the above table as our line of credit is subject to frequent borrowing and or repayment activities which does not lend itself to reliable forecasting for disclosure purposes 
as of february   million was available to us for additional borrowings under the credit facility 
on december  the credit agreement was amended to extend the maturity date to april  and to allow us to acquire a maximum of million of our outstanding shares of common stock 
this amendment follows the board of director s december authorization of a million stock buy back program which will terminate on the earlier of the repurchase of the maximum amount or december  no common stock was repurchased under this plan during fiscal we anticipate that our existing cash and cash flow from operations  supplemented by borrowings under our revolving credit line  will be sufficient to fund our planned store expansion  the capital investment required for the new corporate headquarters and distribution center  the repurchase of our common stock under our current repurchase plan and other operating cash requirements for at least the next months 
see note long term debt and note leases to our notes to consolidated financial statements contained in part ii  item of this report for a discussion of long term debt and leases  respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements during fiscal  we completed negotiations to assign two store operating leases to separate third parties 
we also remain secondarily liable on one other assignment of an operating lease covering a former store location 
we believe that the likelihood of material liability being triggered under these leases is remote  and no liability has been accrued for these contingent lease obligations in our consolidated financial statements as of february  see note leases to our notes to consolidated financial statements contained in part ii  item of this report for further discussion 
except for the assignment of certain store operating leases and operating leases entered into in the normal course of business  we have not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements during fiscal or fiscal  nor did we have any off balance sheet arrangements outstanding at february  or january  seasonality our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated  and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future  primarily as a result of seasonal variances and the timing of sales and costs associated with opening new stores 
non capital expenditures  such as advertising and payroll  incurred prior to the opening of a new store are charged to expense as incurred 
therefore  our results of operations may be adversely affected in any quarter in which we incur pre opening expenses related to the opening of new stores 
we have three distinct peak selling periods easter  back to school and christmas 
new accounting pronouncements recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our operations are contained in note summary of significant accounting policies  contained in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk in that the interest payable on our credit facility is based on variable interest rates and therefore is affected by changes in market rates 
we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in market interest rates 
a change in the weighted average interest rate charged under the credit facility would have resulted in interest expense fluctuating by approximately  in fiscal there were no borrowings on our credit facility in fiscal
