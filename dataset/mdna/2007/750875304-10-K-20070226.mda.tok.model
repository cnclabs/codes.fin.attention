our revenue delivery platform combines our proprietary technology platform  including hosted application software  our proprietary database of corporate buyers of technology products and services  our data development and analytics services and our sales and marketing execution services 
we are headquartered in silicon valley in campbell  california  and have additional operations in austin  texas  oakland  california  and montreal  canada 
our current clients consist primarily of large enterprises operating in the computer hardware and software  telecom and financial services industries 
our strategy for long term  sustained growth is to maintain and improve our position as a leading global provider of integrated sales and marketing solutions 
key elements of our strategy include continuing to enhance the execution of our service offerings to generate more revenue for our existing clients thereby increasing our revenue  continuing to seek cross selling opportunities to increase the range of services provided to our more than existing clients  signing new clients  continuing to identify new services and capabilities that enhance or complement our revenue delivery platform and selectively pursuing strategic acquisitions 
prior to  substantially all of our net revenue was derived from the commissions we earned on the sale of service contract renewals  software licenses and subscriptions  and warranties 
since  we have added multiple sources of revenue  including lead development services and hosted application software 
background we completed our initial public offering in november  raising net proceeds of approximately million 
during the period from the initial public offering through  we focused on expanding our market share of the sale of service contracts for our clients  and added two major computer hardware clients which today remain our most significant clients 
in february  we completed our first acquisition  sunset direct  which added a new service offering the generation of sales leads  or lead generation  for clients 
sunset direct provided us with new clients for our service contract sales solution and also added management talent 
we relocated most of our operations from california to sunset direct s lower cost location in texas 
our net revenues grew to million in from million in this growth was due both to million  or  year over year growth excluding acquisitions in our service contract sales solution and million from our lead development services 
in  we incurred losses of million  due in part to redundancy  severance and other transition costs incurred in moving our base of operations to texas 
since september we have added a number of key executives  and in march our chief executive officer reassumed operational control of our company 
in addition  we have continued to add top management both through hiring and through acquisitions 
the present management team has substantially been in place since early 
table of contents we achieved our first profitable quarter in the quarter ended march  due primarily to revenue growth from existing and new customers and the lower costs resulting from the relocation of our operations to texas 
our acquisition of viewcentral in september added hosted application software for training sales to our service offerings and a significant new customer base 
we reported net revenue of million for the year  representing year over year growth  excluding acquisitions  of  in addition to the million of net revenue from our hosted application software for training sales offering 
we were profitable in each quarter of and reported net income of million for the year 
in january  we acquired cas systems to provide additional complementary lead development functionality  customers  execution expertise and an international presence with its location in montreal  canada 
net revenue we derive revenue from the following the sale of service contract renewals  software licenses and subscriptions  and warranties  from the provision of services related to the development of qualified leads and appointments  and from the licensing of our hosted application software platform for our clients training sales 
service contract renewals  software licenses and subscriptions  and warranty extensions 
we sell  on behalf of our clients  service contract renewals  software licenses and subscriptions and warranty extensions 
we earn commissions on the sale of these services to our clients customers  which we report as our revenue 
we are typically responsible for the complete sales process  including marketing and customer identification and order processing 
we also take responsibility for collecting the amount paid by our client s customer 
as a result  when we complete a sale  we record the full amount of the sale on our balance sheet as accounts receivable 
we record revenue for the commissions we earn on the transaction  which is based on a fixed percentage of the renewal amount based on the agreement with our client 
we record the difference between the sale amount and our commission as an account payable  representing the amount we will remit to our client according to our payment terms  generally to days from the initial sale 
our clients customers pay us by credit card  check or on payment terms which are generally days from sale  and none of our clients customers represented more than of our revenue 
because our revenue from sales of service contract renewals  software licenses and subscriptions  and warranty extensions are commission based  this revenue can vary significantly 
our agreements with our clients for these services typically have two to three year terms  with automatic renewal provisions 
these agreements are generally terminable on to days notice by either party 
we recently started to provide hosted application software which enables our clients resellers to renew service contracts with end users directly 
in these situations we earn commissions on sales by our clients or their resellers but take no responsibility or credit risk for collection from the end user of the services 
lead development 
we provide lead development services to generate  qualify and develop corporate leads  turning these prospects into sales opportunities and qualified appointments for our clients field sales forces and for their channel partners 
our agreements with our clients are generally for fixed fees  have terms ranging from three months to one year and require us to provide fixed resources for the term of the contract 
some of our contracts contain performance requirements 
for the significant majority of our lead generation agreements  we recognize revenue as our services are provided  for our performance based contracts  we recognize revenue as we meet the performance objectives 
to the extent that our clients pay us in advance of the provision of services  we record deferred revenue and recognize the revenue ratably over the contract period 
application software 
we license our hosted application software that our clients use to manage their online and in person training programs 
the licenses are usually for one year terms  and are often paid in advance 
these advance payments are recorded as deferred revenue  and recognized ratably over the contract period 

table of contents gross profit  gross margin gross profit is calculated as net revenue less the costs associated with selling our clients products or delivering our services to our clients  gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of net revenue 
cost of services include compensation costs of sales personnel  sales commissions and bonuses  costs of designing  producing and delivering marketing services  credit card fees  bad debts  and salaries and other personnel expenses related to fee based activities 
costs of services also include the cost of allocated facility and telephone usage for our telesales representatives as well as other direct costs associated with the delivery of our services 
cost of services related to training sales relates primarily to the cost of personnel to support our hosted application 
most of the costs are personnel related and are relatively fixed 
bonuses and sales commissions will typically change in proportion to net revenue or profitability 
commission and bonus expense included in gross margin are related to incentives paid to our telesales representatives for incremental sales of our clients contracts and leads generated 
our gross margins will fluctuate in the future with changes in our product mix 
margins from sales of our clients service contract renewals are higher than our lead generation services  and licensing from our hosted application software is our highest margin service 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses are primarily costs associated with client acquisition  including compensation costs of marketing and sales personnel  sales commissions  bonuses  marketing and promotional expenses  participation in trade shows and conferences and client integration costs 
commission expense included in sales and marketing expenses relates to the variable compensation paid to our sales people who generate sales growth from new and existing clients 
the sales cycle required to generate new clients varies within our product mix 
in some cases  the lead time to create a new client can be substantial and we will incur sales and marketing costs for efforts that may not be successful 
technology and development expenses technology and development expenses include costs associated with the technology infrastructure that supports our rainmaker revenue delivery platform 
these costs include compensation and related costs for technology personnel  consultants  purchases of non capitalizable software and hardware  and support and maintenance costs related to our systems 
we are also investing in the continued development of our revenue delivery platform 
technology and development expenses do not include depreciation of hardware and software systems 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include costs associated with the administration of our business and consist primarily of compensation and related costs for administrative personnel  insurance  and legal and other professional fees 
most of these costs relate to personnel  insurance and facilities and are relatively fixed 
in we expect that we will be required to be compliant with the auditor attestation provisions of section of the sarbanes oxley act of we will incur substantial additional costs in to achieve compliance with the sarbanes oxley act and therefore expect a significant increase in absolute dollars in general and administrative expenses in stock based compensation prior to  cost of revenue and operating expenses include stock based compensation expense to the extent the fair value of our common stock exceeds the exercise price of stock options granted to employees on the date of grant 
effective in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted accounting provisions pursuant to the requirements of sfas r  share based payment 
sfas r addresses all forms of share based payment awards  including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans  stock options  restricted stock and stock appreciation rights 
sfas r requires us to expense share based payment awards with compensation cost for share based payment transactions measured at fair value 

table of contents depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses consist of depreciation and amortization of property  equipment and software licenses  and intangible assets 
we have completed the acquisition of four businesses in the past two years  and accordingly have been increasing our intangible amortization expense 
in the first quarter of  we completed the acquisition of cas systems  and will therefore incur higher intangible asset amortization in the future 
interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net reflects income received on cash and cash equivalents  interest expense on leases to secure equipment  software and other financing agreements  and other income and expense 
critical accounting policies estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to our revenue  asset impairments  business combinations  income taxes and commitments and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management s expectations  future results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions 
management has discussed the development of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors and has reviewed the disclosures of such policies and management s estimates in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we disclosed our critical accounting policies and estimates in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  management believes there have been no significant changes during the year ended december  to the items  except for the newly applicable accounting policies and estimates relating to fas r 
use of estimates the preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  requires us to establish accounting policies that contain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to revenue recognition and presentation policies  valuation of accounts receivable  and the assessment of recoverability and measuring impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and fixed assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the policies that contain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes include revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill  intangible assets and property and equipment  
table of contents measurement of our deferred tax assets and corresponding valuation allowance  allocation of purchase price in business combinations  and fair value estimates for the expense of employee stock options 
we have other equally important accounting policies and practices 
however  once adopted  these policies either generally do not require us to make significant estimates or assumptions or otherwise only require implementation of the adopted policy  not a judgment as to the application of policy itself 
despite our intention to establish accurate estimates and assumptions  actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition and financial statement presentation substantially all of our revenue is generated from the sale of service contract renewals  lead development services and software licenses for hosted application software for training sales 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our clients service contract renewals under the provisions of staff accounting bulletin sab revenue recognition and on the net basis in accordance with eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
revenue from the sale of service contract renewals is recognized when a purchase order from the client s customer is received  the service contract agreement is delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable  the collection of the receivable is reasonably assured  and no significant post delivery obligations remain unfulfilled 
revenue from lead development services we perform is recognized as the services are accepted and is generally earned ratably over the service contract period 
some of our lead development service revenue is earned when we achieve certain attainment levels and is recognized upon customer acceptance of the service 
we earn revenue from our licensing of hosted software applications for training sales ratably over each contract period  having considered eitf application of aicpa sop  software revenue recognition  to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware  which distinguishes hosting services that might fall under the scope of sop software revenue recognition 
since these software licenses are usually paid in advance  we record a deferred revenue liability on our balance sheet that represents the prepaid portions of licenses that will be earned over the next one to two years 
we generally do not enter into multiple element revenue arrangements with our clients 
our revenue recognition policy involves significant judgments and estimates about collectibility 
we assess the probability of collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history and or the creditworthiness of our clients customers  which is based on current published credit ratings  current events and circumstances regarding the business of our clients customer and other factors that we believe are relevant 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  we defer revenue recognition until such time as collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash payment 
in addition we provide an allowance in accrued liabilities for the cancellation of service contracts that occurs within a specified time after the sale  which is typically less than days 
this amount is calculated based on historical results and constitutes a reduction of the net revenue we record for the commission we earn on the sale 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients customers to make required payments of amounts due to us 
the allowance is comprised of specifically identified account balances for which collection is currently deemed doubtful 
in addition to specifically identified accounts  estimates of amounts that may not be collectible from those accounts whose collection is not yet deemed doubtful but which may become doubtful in the future are made based on historical bad debt write off experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
at december  and  our allowance for potentially uncollectible accounts was  and  respectively 

table of contents property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost 
depreciation of property and equipment is recorded using the straight line method over the assets estimated useful lives 
computer equipment and capitalized software are depreciated over two to five years and furniture and fixtures are depreciated over five years 
amortization of leasehold improvements is recorded using the straight line method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets 
amortization of fixed assets under capital leases is included in depreciation expense 
costs of internal use software are accounted for in accordance with statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use and emerging issue task force issue no 
eitf  accounting for website development costs 
sop and eitf require that we expense computer software and website development costs as they are incurred during the preliminary project stage 
once the capitalization criteria of sop and eitf have been met  external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal use software  including website development  the payroll and payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time to the internal use computer software and associated interest costs  are capitalized 
capitalized costs are amortized using the straight line method over the shorter of the term of related client agreement  if such development relates to a specific client  or the software s estimated useful life  ranging from two to five years 
capitalized internal use software and website development costs are included in property and equipment in the accompanying balance sheets 
during  we put in place a new customer relationship management system that included capitalized internal development costs 
in total  the system cost million and is being amortized over five years on a straight line basis 
net operating loss carryforwards as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state of california tax purposes of million and million respectively 
the net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in through  if not utilized 
during  we performed an analysis of prior ownership changes which would result in a limitation on the availability of our net operating losses 
this analysis indicated that our company twice had ownership changes as defined under irc section which limit the utilization of our net operating losses 
the amount of net operating losses available for utilization during will be approximately million  increasing to million in all historic losses incurred will be available as of in the event that we experience another ownership change as defined under irc section  the utilization of these losses could be further limited 
goodwill and other intangible assets we apply the guidance of the financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 business combinations in accounting for the assets related to our acquisitions 
goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition purchase price over the estimated fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
in our analysis of goodwill and other intangible assets we apply the guidance of fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets in determining whether any impairment conditions exist 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
intangible assets are attributable to the various technologies  customer relationships and tradenames of the businesses we have acquired 
to date  no circumstances or indicators have arisen to indicate that the carrying value has been impaired 
long lived assets long lived assets excluding goodwill including our purchased intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
in accordance with fasb no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long 
table of contents lived assets  long lived assets  such as property  equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
significant concentrations in  dell and hewlett packard each accounted for more than of our net revenue and collectively represented of our net revenue  with dell representing of our net revenue 
in  these two clients accounted for of net revenue  with dell accounting for of our net revenue 
in  four clients  including dell and hewlett packard  each accounted for more than of our net revenue 
in  combined sales to these four clients accounted for of net revenue  with dell accounting for of our net revenue 
no individual client s end user customer accounted for or more of our net revenue in any period presented 
we have service agreements with our clients that expire at various dates ranging through april many of our client agreements contain automatic renewal clauses 
these clients may  however  terminate their contracts for cause in accordance with the provisions of each contract 
substantially all clients must provide us with advance written notice of their intention to terminate 
dell and hewlett packard may terminate their contracts with and days notice  respectively 
any loss of a significant client would likely have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  cash flows and results of operations 
we expect that a substantial portion of our net revenue will continue to be concentrated among a few significant clients 
in addition  our technology clients operate in industries that are experiencing consolidation  which may reduce the number of our existing and potential clients 
related party transactions we have made purchases of computer equipment and services from several vendors including dell and hewlett packard  our two largest clients 
during the year ended december   we purchased equipment from dell and hewlett packard totaling  and  respectively 
during  we purchased certain of our computer equipment and software from dell through arrangements accounted for as capital leases 
the single remaining lease bears interest at per annum and expires in february as of december   our property and equipment included amounts held under capital leases with dell of approximately  and related accumulated depreciation of approximately  principal and interest owed to dell amounted to approximately  at december  these capital lease obligations are collateralized by the related leased property and equipment 
we also lease computers from hewlett packard  another significant client  on a month to month basis 
these capital lease obligations are collateralized by the related leased property and equipment 
the chairman of our board of directors also serves on the board of saama technologies  a technology services firm 
during the year ended december   we paid saama technologies  for technology services 
we continue to utilize their services and may expand the scope of saama technologies engagement

net revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in revenue from service contract sales grew million  or  to million substantially as a result of increased sales from existing clients 
revenue from lead development grew million  or  to million primarily due to expansion with existing clients and  to a lesser extent  the addition of new clients 
our acquisition of viewcentral on september  added million in revenue from the licensing of hosted software for training sales 
costs of services and gross margin 
costs of services increased million  or  to million in from million in our gross margin percentage improved to in from in primarily as a result of the efficiencies and lower costs associated with the move of our base of operations from california to texas which was completed in in  we incurred significant redundancy and transition expenses associated with managing two facilities 
accordingly  the company does not expect to achieve significant margin improvement in the foreseeable future 
our margins are dependent on the mix among our highest margin hosted software license revenue  our service contract sales revenue and our lowest margin lead generation revenue  which can vary from period to period 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in in we increased our corporate marketing activities by  as a result of the addition of staff  the improvement of our website and participation in trade shows and conferences 
the balance of the increased costs in was due to increased commissions arising from greater success by our sales force and  to a slightly lesser extent  sales and marketing costs associated with viewcentral  which was acquired in september we expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars and slightly as a percentage of revenue for the foreseeable future as we continue to grow 
technology and development expenses 
technology expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in despite this significant increase in absolute dollars  technology and development costs decreased as a percentage of net revenue from to 
we are engaged in continuing 
table of contents significant efforts to enhance our infrastructure 
during and through the first quarter of  we developed a new customer relationship management  or crm  system that we use for service sales 
certain internal costs were required to be capitalized in connection with this project  which resulted in approximately  less expense in than approximately  of the increase in was due to infrastructure hosting costs associated with additional software and network upgrades 
we believe that by using outsourced hosting for parts of our technology infrastructure  we will be able to leverage the future expansion of our business 
we also incurred an additional  in technology consulting expense in relating to the general expansion of our technology infrastructure to support our growing business 
we expect technology and development expenses to increase on a absolute dollar basis and as a percentage of net revenues in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased  or  from million in to million in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue declined significantly  to from 
in late  we completed the transition of most of our finance operations from california to texas 
the completion of this transition resulted in the reduction of redundant positions and reduced the need for more expensive temporary staff and contractors who were retained during the transition 
we recorded  in severance costs in associated with a former officer that were not repeated in in  we will likely be required to be compliant with the auditor attestation provisions of section of the sarbanes oxley act of we will incur additional and substantial costs in to achieve compliance with the sarbanes oxley act and  therefore  expect our general and administrative expenses to increase significantly in absolute dollars 
depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased  or  to million from million in amortization of intangible assets increased by  in as a result of additional acquisitions  partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expenses of  as some assets became fully depreciated 
because of our acquisitions and the growth of our infrastructure  we expect depreciation and amortization expense to increase significantly in interest and other expense income  net 
the components of interest and other expense income  net are as follows dollars in thousands years ended december  increase decrease amt interest income interest expense other the increase in interest income is attributable to an increase in cash available to invest in interest bearing deposits 
interest expense is the result of the million term loan obtained in february in connection with the acquisition of sunset direct  interest on the million june term loan to fund the purchase and implementation of our new client management system and interest on obligations under capital leases 
we have been making principal payments on these term loans and interest expense was therefore reduced in in  we were required to capitalize  in interest costs associated with the development of our client management system  amortization of which began in comparison of years ended december  and net revenue 
net revenue from services increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase in net revenue is primarily the result of million of lead development revenues contributed by sunset direct  which we acquired in february in addition  net revenues from our service contracts product line increased million  or  from million in to million in 
table of contents costs of services and gross margin 
costs of services increased million  or  to million in from million in costs of services also increased as a percentage of revenue from in to in our gross margin decreased to in from in  primarily as a result of the duplicative costs that were incurred when we moved a significant part of our operations from california to our location in texas 
the increase in costs of services in absolute dollars was due to an overall increase in direct sales and marketing personnel as a result of our acquisition of sunset direct  as well as the aforementioned duplication of costs during the move 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in this was primarily attributable to the addition of sales and marketing personnel through our acquisition of sunset direct and the increase of salespeople focused on adding new clients to our business  and  in severance costs related to employees terminated in technology and development expenses 
technology expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was primarily attributable to the addition of technology personnel and operations through our acquisition of sunset direct 
in addition  we incurred higher consulting and support fees in connection with the on going upgrade of our it infrastructure 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in as compared to million in the increase is primarily due to the addition of sunset direct administrative personnel  the rent expense of  associated with the sunset direct facility in texas and severance costs of  related to executive terminations in additionally  during  we moved a significant part of our operations from california to our location in texas 
during this transition we incurred some duplicate staffing costs as well as other costs associated with the hiring of employees 
depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased million  or  to million from million in the increase is due to  of amortization expense associated with intangibles acquired in connection with our acquisition of sunset direct  and the result of higher net book values of depreciable assets  primarily related to capitalized internal software development projects  as compared to interest and other expense income  net

 net revenue costs of services gross margin operating expenses sales and marketing technology and development general and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income loss interest and other income expense  net income loss before income tax expense income tax expense net income loss revenue we have increased our revenue sequentially in each quarter from the first quarter of these increases have been primarily due to organic revenue growth in our service contract sales and lead development service offerings 
we added our hosted application software for training sales near the end of the third quarter of  which contributed million of revenue in the fourth quarter of gross margin gross margin generally improved throughout as we completed the transition of a majority of our operations to a lower cost location in texas 
gross margins have remained almost constant in  with minor fluctuations as a result of changes in our mix of services provided to our clients 
operating expenses we experienced unusually high operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in the first quarter of due to severance costs related to management terminations 
operating expenses as a percentage of revenues declined in the remainder of  and have remained within a narrow range in general and administrative expenses have declined since the first quarter of primarily as a result of our significant revenue growth while we maintained tight controls over general and administrative expenses 
commencing in the fourth quarter of  we have increased our investment in sales and marketing by undertaking various corporate marketing initiatives  including trade shows and conferences  and by adding sales staff 
sales and marketing expenses increased more significantly in the fourth quarter of due to our acquisition of viewcentral 
beginning in  we have incurred increasing technology and development expenses relating to our investment in technology infrastructure  software development and tools in support of future growth 
however  we have experienced only slight growth in technology and development expense as a percentage of net revenue 
we will continue to accelerate our investment in technology and development in 
table of contents income loss from operations we reduced our operating losses sequentially in each quarter of we became profitable in the first quarter of and have maintained profitability in each quarter of our operating income as a percentage of revenue remained relatively constant in due primarily to increases in non cash costs for the amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions  and  in the fourth quarter of  an increase in stock based compensation expense as a result of additional equity awards to employees 
liquidity and sources of capital we generated million of cash from operating activities in we used cash in operating activities in substantially all years prior to and we funded our operations from cash proceeds from the sale of common stock and the incurrence of debt 
from through  we raised aggregate net proceeds of million from private placements of common stock 
during the same period  we raised an aggregate of million from term loans from institutional lenders to fund our operations and support our acquisitions of other businesses 
cash flow from operating activities for was million as compared to cash used in operating activities of  in cash provided by operating activities in was primarily the result of net income totaling million  non cash expenditures of depreciation and amortization of property and intangibles  stock based compensation and the provision for allowance for doubtful accounts that totaled million and changes in operating assets and liabilities  net of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  that provided million 
the two largest components of our changes in operating assets and liabilities are accounts payable and accounts receivable 
when we sell a service or maintenance contract for a client  we record the sales price of the contract to the client s customer as our receivable and also record our payable to the client for our cost of the contract  which is effectively the same amount less our compensation for obtaining the contract for our client 
for this reason  our accounts payable is composed primarily of amounts due to our clients for service and maintenance contracts we sold on their behalf 
accounts payable therefore increases in relation to our increased sales of service contracts on behalf of our clients 
however  because we report as revenue only the net difference between our account receivable from the customer of our client and our account payable to our client  any increase in net revenue from service contract sales results in a much larger increase in our accounts payable  which is treated as positive cash flow from operating activities 
accounts receivable increased at december  as compared to december  as a result of higher overall sales at the end of as compared to the end of our days sales outstanding  or dso  remained at days for both december  and since we record the gross billing to the end customer of our clients in our accounts receivable  we calculate dso based on our ability to collect those gross billings from the end customers 
our accounts payable has increased at a faster rate than the increase in accounts receivable 
in august  we enhanced our collections management and staff  which has greatly improved our collections efforts 
the difference in growth between our accounts payable and accounts receivable generated cash flows of million in and million in the million increase in accrued compensation and benefits at december  as compared to december  was due to higher accruals for commissions and bonuses as result of higher sales volumes and positive operating results 
the million increase in deferred revenue was primarily a result of the increase in our lead generation service offerings which are invoiced and often paid in advance of the work to be performed 
in connection with our acquisition of viewcentral  we acquired additional deferred revenue that represents the prepayment of subscriptions for our online event management services 
the million increase in other accrued liabilities is attributable  in part  to increased sales tax liability due to increased sales volumes and current tax liability for income and franchise tax

recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authority 
the recently issued literature also provides guidance on the derecognition  measurement and classification of income tax uncertainties  along with any related interest and penalties 
fin also includes guidance concerning accounting for income tax uncertainties in interim periods and increases the level of disclosures associated with any recorded income tax uncertainties 
the interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  any differences between the amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior to the adoption of fin and the amounts reported after adoption will be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance of retained earnings 
we 
table of contents expect that the disclosures required with the adoption of fin will indicate that the potential impact of uncertain positions is less than in september  the sec issued sab no 
 materiality 
the interpretations in sab are being issued to address diversity in practice in quantifying financial statement misstatements and the potential under current practice for the build up of improper amounts on the balance sheet 
sab is effective for the first interim period of the first fiscal year ending after november  the adoption of the provisions of sab did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas replaces the different definitions of fair value in the accounting literature with a single definition 
it defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
sfas is effective for fair value measurements already required or permitted by other standards for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio 
we currently do not and do not plan to use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we plan to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and investment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in low risk securities 
to minimize our risks  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of short term and liquid securities including money market funds  commercial paper  us government and agency securities and municipal bonds 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
as of december   of our portfolio was invested in instruments that mature in less than days 
see note of our consolidated financial statements 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of our investment portfolio at december   we do not believe we have a material exposure to interest rate risk 
our earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of the term loan  the june term loan and the revolving credit facility  which bear interest at variable rates based on the prime lending rate at december  
maturity dates on these loans range from october to may at december   we had million of debt outstanding under these loans 
based on the average principal outstanding during  we estimate that a increase in interest rates would result in  in additional interest expense for the year ended december  due to the our debt level at december   anticipated cash flows from operations  and the various financial alternatives available to management  should there be an adverse change in interest rates  we do not believe that we have significant exposure to market risks associated with changing interest rates as of december  we do not use derivative financial instruments in our operations 
at december   the interest rates on all of our outstanding capital leases are fixed and therefore not subject to interest rate fluctuations 
our interest rates on our debt are at a variable rate of prime per annum
