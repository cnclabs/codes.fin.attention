item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we develop and market a comprehensive suite of e commerce software products  as well as provide related services including support and maintenance  education  application hosting  professional services and proactive conversion solutions for enhancing online sales and support 
we primarily derive revenue from the sale of software products and related services 
our software licenses are priced based on the size of the customer implementation 
services revenue is derived from fees for professional services  training  support and maintenance  application hosting and proactive conversion solutions 
professional services include implementation  custom application development and project and technical consulting 
we bill professional service fees primarily on a time and materials basis 
support and maintenance arrangements are priced based on the level of support services provided as a percent of net license fees on a per annum basis 
under support and maintenance services  customers are generally entitled to receive software updates  maintenance releases and technical support 
training is billed as services are provided 
revenue from application hosting services is recognized monthly as the services are provided based on a per transaction  per cpu or percent of revenue basis 
proactive conversion solutions  recently offered as a result of the estara acquisition  are priced on a per transaction basis and recognized monthly as the services are provided 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
see risk factors elsewhere in this annual report on form k for a discussion of certain risks associated with our business 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers  acquisitions  or divestitures of business combinations that may be announced after the date hereof 
recent events on october   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock and common stock equivalents of estara  inc  a provider of proactive conversion solutions for enhancing online sales and support initiatives  in exchange for approximately million shares of atg common stock valued at million and approximately million in cash  excluding transaction costs 
we also issued million shares of restricted stock  which will be recognized as stock based compensation expense over the vesting term 
the revenues and expenses generated from acquisition date  october  to december  were not significant to our fiscal financial results reported in our consolidated statement of operations included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
on january   we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method as permitted under sfas r 
under this transition method  compensation cost recognized in fiscal includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to but not yet vested as of december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas  and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
in accordance with the modified prospective method of adoption  our results of operations and financial position for prior periods have not been restated 
for the year ended december   our stock based compensation expense was million  as compared to a de minimis expense for years ended december  and critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  research and development costs  restructuring expenses  the impairment of 
table of contents long lived assets  income taxes and assumptions for stock based compensation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience  known trends or events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
definitions we define our critical accounting policies as those accounting principles generally accepted in the united states that require us to make subjective estimates about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles 
our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and applied and require us to assess a range of potential outcomes 
we believe the following critical accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment 
revenue recognition we recognize service and hosting revenue not related to software arrangements in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the service is performed and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
in addition  the delivered element must have stand alone value and we must have specific objective evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements 
at the inception of a customer contract for service  we make a judgment of the customer s ability to pay for the services provided 
we base our estimate on a combination of factors  including the successful completion of a credit check or financial review  our payment history with the customer and other forms of payment assurance 
upon the completion of these steps  we recognize revenue monthly in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
we also license software under perpetual license agreements 
we apply the provisions of statement of position  or sop   software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modifications of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
in accordance with sop and sop  revenues from software product license agreements are recognized upon execution of a license agreement and delivery of the software  provided that the fee is fixed or determinable and deemed collectible by management 
if conditions for acceptance are required subsequent to delivery  revenues are recognized upon customer acceptance if such acceptance is not deemed to be perfunctory 
as prescribed by this accounting guidance  we apply the residual method of accounting 
the residual method requires that the portion of the total arrangement fee attributable to undelivered elements  as indicated by vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  is deferred and subsequently recognized when delivered 
the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements  if all other revenue recognition criteria of sop are met 
consulting revenues from these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from software licenses because the arrangements qualify as service transactions as defined in sop the more significant factors considered in determining whether the revenue should be accounted for separately include the nature of services ie  consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product  degree of risk  availability of services from other vendors  timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the software license fee 
revenues from software maintenance are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance  which is typically one year 
we derive revenues from the sale of application hosting and proactive conversion solutions by providing services to customers who have executed contracts with terms of one year or longer 
these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly level of usage and provide the rate at which the customer must pay for actual usage above the monthly minimum 
for these services  we recognize the monthly minimum as revenue each 
table of contents month provided that an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties  the service has been delivered to the customer  the fee for the service is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
should a customer s usage of these services exceed the monthly minimum  we recognize revenue for such excess usage in the period of the usage 
we typically charge the customer an installation fee when the services are first activated 
the installation fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated life of the customer arrangement 
when software products are licensed perpetually in conjunction with application hosting and or proactive conversion solutions  we allocate revenue between the elements based on each element s relative fair value  provided that each element meets the criteria as a separate element under sop an item is considered a separate element if we have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the element 
fair value is generally determined based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately 
if the fair value of each element cannot be objectively determined  the total value of the arrangement is recognized ratably over the entire service period to the extent that all services were provided at the outset of the period 
for most multiple element arrangements where software products are sold in conjunction with application hosting and or proactive conversion solutions  the fair value of each element has not been objectively determinable 
therefore  all revenue under these types of arrangements is recognized ratably over the related estimated service period to the extent that all services have begun to be provided at the outset of the period 
revenues from professional service arrangements are recognized as the services are performed  provided that amounts due from customers are fixed or determinable and deemed collectible by management 
we charge for professional services primarily on a time and material basis 
amounts collected prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are reflected as deferred revenue 
deferred revenue primarily consists of advance payments related to support and maintenance  hosting and service agreements 
we also sell our services through a reseller channel 
assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  we recognize revenue from reseller arrangements based on the reseller s contracted commitment 
we do not grant our resellers the right of return or price protection 
accounts receivable and bad debts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and determine the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical experience and specific customer collection issues 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
research and development costs we account for research and development costs in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs  and sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  which specifies that costs incurred internally to develop computer software products should be charged to expense as incurred until technological feasibility is reached for the product 
once technological feasibility is reached  all software costs should be capitalized until the product is made available for general release to customers 
judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility is established 
we believe that the time period from reaching technological feasibility until the time of general product release is very short 
costs incurred after technological feasibility is reached are not material  and accordingly  all such costs are charged to research and development expense as incurred 
restructuring expenses during the years ended  and  we recorded net restructuring charges benefits of million  million and million  respectively  pertaining to the closure and consolidation of excess facilities  impairment of assets as discussed below  employee severance benefits and settlement of certain contractual obligations 
these charges and benefits were recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  sfas no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments 
table of contents of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits and sab no 
sab  restructuring and impairment charges 
the and charges were recorded in accordance with eitf  issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  sfas  and sab in determining the charges to record  we made certain estimates and judgments surrounding the amounts ultimately to be paid for the actions we have taken 
at december   there were several accruals recorded for lease obligations  which may be adjusted periodically for either resolution of certain contractual commitments or changes in estimates of sublease income or the period of time the facilities will be vacant and subleased 
although we do not anticipate additional significant changes to our restructuring accruals  the actual costs may differ from those recorded in the event that the subleasing assumptions require adjustment 
such changes in estimates have had a material impact on our operating results in the past and could have a material impact on our operating results in the future 
to estimate the costs related to our restructuring efforts  management made its best estimates of the most likely expected outcomes of the significant actions to accomplish the restructuring 
these estimates principally related to costs attributable to excess leased facilities and included estimates of future sublease income  future net operating expenses of the facilities  brokerage commissions and other expenses 
the most significant of these estimates related to the timing and extent of future sublease income that would reduce our lease obligations 
included in our accrued restructuring balance at december  was estimated sublease income of million 
we based our estimate of sublease income on the status of current negotiations with a potential subtenant and current market conditions and rental rates for this location 
actual results may vary significantly from this estimate  depending in part on our ability to obtain approval of the sublease from the landlord 
we review the status of our restructuring activities on a quarterly basis and  if appropriate  record adjustments to our restructuring obligations in our financial statements for such quarter based on management s current best estimates 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets  including intangible assets we review our long lived assets  including intangible assets subject to amortization  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if such assets are considered impaired  the impairment to be recognized is equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value determined by either a quoted market price  if any  or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique 
in assessing recoverability  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and discount factors 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
intangible assets with determinable lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives  based upon the pattern in which the expected benefits will be realized  or on a straight line basis  whichever is greater 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually  as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows 
because we have one reporting segment under sfas  we utilize the entity wide approach for assessing goodwill for impairment and compare our market value to our net book value to determine if impairment exists 
no impairment of goodwill resulted from our evaluation of goodwill in any of the fiscal years presented 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets quarterly and adjust the amount of such 
table of contents allowance  if necessary 
at december  and  we have provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the realizability of these assets 
the valuation allowance decreased million to million in from million in the primary reason for the decrease in the valuation allowance is due to a decrease of million utilized to offset current book income and an increase of million related to tax credits and other temporary differences 
in addition  we have provided for potential amounts due in various foreign tax jurisdictions 
judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax expense provision 
in the ordinary course of global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made 
during and  we reversed previously accrued taxes of million and  respectively  for foreign locations due to the closure of the tax years under audit or the expiration of the statute of limitations in certain foreign jurisdictions 
stock based compensation expense since january   we have accounted for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r 
historically  we recognized stock based compensation costs pursuant to accounting principles bulletin no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and elected to disclose the impact of expensing stock options pursuant to sfas no 
 share based payment  in the notes to our financial statements 
see note to the financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
we have selected the black scholes option pricing model to determine fair value of stock option awards 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected life of the stock awards and the volatility of the underlying common stock 
our assumptions may differ from those used in prior periods because of adjustments to the calculation of such assumptions based upon the guidance of sfas no 
r and sab no 
 share based payment 
changes to the assumptions may have a significant impact on the fair value of stock options  which could have a material impact on our financial statements 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
should our actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from our estimates  our stock based compensation expense and results of operations could be materially impacted

we expect this percentage to be in the range of to in the expected year over year decrease in product license revenue as a percent of total revenue is due to our expectation that an increasing percent of product license revenue will be recognized ratably 
our resellers receive a discount from our list price 
the extent of any discount is based on negotiated contractual agreements between us and the reseller 
we do not grant our resellers the right of return  price protection or favorable payment terms 
we rely upon resellers to market and sell our products and support and maintenance to governmental entities and to customers in geographic regions where it is not cost effective for us to sell directly 
we have approximately active resellers 
reseller revenues and the percentage of revenues from resellers can vary significantly from period to period 
no resellers accounted for more than of our revenues in  or services revenues services revenues increased to million for from million for the increase was primarily attributable to the addition of estara service revenue

restructuring in through  we took restructuring actions to realign our operating expenses and facilities with the requirements of our business and current market conditions and recorded adjustments to prior restructuring charges 
these actions have included closure and consolidation of excess facilities  reductions in the number of our employees  abandonment or disposal of tangible assets and settlement of contractual obligations 
in connection with each of these actions we have recorded restructuring charges  based in part upon our estimates of the costs ultimately to be paid for the actions we have taken 
when circumstances result in changes in our estimates relating to our accrued restructuring costs  we reflect these changes as additional charges or benefits in the period in which the change of estimate occurs 
as of december   we had restructuring accruals of million 
we recorded charges benefits of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
for detailed information about our restructuring activities and related costs and accruals  see note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k 
abandoned facilities obligations at december   we had lease arrangements related to three abandoned facilities 
of these locations  the restructuring accrual for the waltham  massachusetts location is net of assumed sublease income 
we have made certain assumptions regarding the future sublease income for this facility which are shown in the table below 
the restructuring accrual for the other facilities  is net of contractual amounts due under any executed sub lease agreement 
all locations for which we have recorded restructuring charges have been exited  and thus our plans with respect to these leases have been completed 
a summary of the remaining abandoned facility locations and the timing of the remaining cash payments are as follows in thousands total waltham  ma san francisco  ca reading  uk facility obligations  gross contracted and assumed sublet income net cash obligations interest and other income  net interest and other income  net increased to million for from  for the increase was primarily due to an increase in interest income resulting from our higher average cash and investment balances and foreign currency exchange gains

provision benefit for income taxes for the year ended december   we recorded an income tax benefit of million 
this relates to reversing certain tax reserves in foreign locations that were no longer required due to closed tax years under audit and expiration of the statue of limitations at certain foreign jurisdictions 
we had no federal or foreign income taxes for due to taxable losses in domestic and certain foreign locations in and the use of net operating loss carry forwards 
we recorded state income taxes for of 
table of contents approximately  accordingly  only a state provision for taxes has been recorded for taxes recorded in were for foreign locations 
in  we reversed previously accrued taxes for foreign locations due to the closure of statute of limitations  or as a result of changes in our estimates of potential amounts due in those locations 
as a result of historical net operating losses incurred  and after evaluating our anticipated performance over our normal planning horizon  we have provided a full valuation allowance for our net operating loss carry forwards  research credit carry forwards and other net deferred tax assets 
the primary differences between our book and tax income that give rise to a tax loss for are due to the amortization of capitalized research and development expenses and payments on lease restructuring reserves partially offset by sfas r stock compensation expenses 
estara acquisition on october   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of privately held estara  inc to enhance online sales and support initiatives 
the aggregate purchase price was million  which consisted of million of our common stock  million of cash issued for transaction bonus to estara employees of million and million in lieu of issuing atg common stock to non accredited investors  and million of transaction costs  which primarily consisted of fees paid for financial advisory  legal and accounting services 
we issued approximately million shares of atg common stock  the fair value of which was based upon a five day average of the closing price two days before and two days after the terms of the acquisition were agreed to and publicly announced 
the excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired resulted in goodwill of million 
we also issued million shares of restricted stock which will be recognized as stock based compensation expense over the vesting term 
in connection with this acquisition  we acquired million of intangible assets for customer relationships  developed technology and trademarks  which are being amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we may also pay up to an additional million in potential earn out payments to the stockholders and employees of estara based on the estara revenues for fiscal if estara s revenues exceed million but are less than million  atg will be required to pay million  of which million will be distributed to the stockholders and million will be distributed to employees 
in the event estara s revenues exceed million  atg will be required to pay an additional million  of which million will be distributed to stockholders and million will be distributed to employees 
the payments to stockholders will be recorded as additional purchase price  and the amounts paid to employees will be accounted for as compensation expense in our income statement as it relates to amounts paid to estara employee shareholders in excess of that paid to non employee stockholders 
these payments may be made  at our option  in the form of cash or stock  subject to the applicable rules of the nasdaq stock market and applicable limitations under the tax rules to permit the transaction to be categorized as a tax free reorganization 
liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements relate primarily to facilities  employee infrastructure and working capital requirements 
our primary sources of liquidity at december  were our cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities of million 
cash provided by operating activities was million in this consisted of net income of million  depreciation and amortization of million  stock based compensation expense of million  offset by a million increase in accounts receivable and a million decrease in accrued restructuring costs 
our investing activities for the year ended december  used cash of million  which consisted primarily of net cash payments associated with the acquisition of estara  inc of million  capital expenditures of million and net purchases of marketable securities of million 
we expect capital expenditures in to be approximately of annual revenue 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   which consisted primarily of million in proceeds from exercised employee stock options offset by principal payments on notes payable and capital leases 
we believe that our balance of million in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities at december   including the effect of the cash to be paid to complete the estara acquisition  along with other 
table of contents working capital and cash expected to be generated by our operations will allow us to meet our liquidity needs over at least the next twelve months 
however  our actual cash requirements will depend on many factors  including particularly  overall economic conditions both domestically and abroad 
we may seek additional external funds through public or private securities offerings  strategic alliances or other financing sources 
there can be no assurance that if we seek external funding  it will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
credit facility we have an existing million revolving line of credit with silicon valley bank the bank 
the line of credit is secured by all of our tangible and intangible personal property and is subject to financial covenants including liquidity coverage and profitability 
the line of credit will expire on january  while there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility at december   the bank had issued standing letters of credit totaling million on our behalf  which are supported by this facility 
the standing letters of credit have been issued in favor of various landlords to secure obligations under our facility leases pursuant to leases expiring through december the line of credit bears interest at the bank s prime rate at december  
as of december   approximately million was available under the facility 
contractual obligations on december   our contractual cash obligations  which consist primarily of operating leases  were as follows in thousands less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating leases in addition  we have an obligation for contingent consideration of up to million based on estara s revenue 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued fin no

fin no 
clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin no 
prescribes a two step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized 
first  the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination 
if the tax position is deemed more likely than not to be sustained  the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement

sab expresses the sec staff s views regarding the process of quantifying and recording financial statement misstatements 
these interpretations were issued to address diversity in practice and the potential under current practice for the build up of improper amounts on the balance sheet 
sab expresses the sec staff s view that a registrant s materiality evaluation of an identified unadjusted error should quantify the effects of the error on each financial statement and related financial statement disclosures and that prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab also states that correcting prior year financial statements for immaterial errors would not require previously filed reports to be amended 
such correction may be made the next time the registrant files the prior year financial statements 
registrants electing not to restate prior periods should reflect the effects of initially applying the guidance in sab in their annual financial statements covering the first fiscal year ending after november  the cumulative effect of the initial application should be reported in the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of that fiscal year and the offsetting adjustment should be made to the opening balance of retained earnings for that year 
registrants should disclose the nature and amount of each individual error being 
table of contents corrected in the cumulative adjustment 
the disclosure should also include when and how each error arose and the fact that the errors had previously been considered immaterial 
the sec staff encourages early application of the guidance in sab for interim periods of the first fiscal year ending after november  the implementation of sab did not have any impact on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements but may change current practice for some entities 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those years 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact of sfas on our financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of investment grade money market funds  corporate obligations and government obligations with a weighted average maturity of less than one year 
these held to maturity securities are subject to interest rate risk 
however  a change in interest rates would not have any impact to the fair values of these securities at december  and primarily due to their short maturity and our intent to hold the securities to maturity 
there have been no significant changes since december  the majority of our operations are based in the us  and accordingly  the majority of our transactions are denominated in us dollars 
however  we have foreign based operations where transactions are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of foreign currencies 
our primary foreign currency exposures relate to our short term intercompany balances with our foreign subsidiaries and accounts receivable valued in the united kingdom in us dollars 
our primary foreign subsidiaries have functional currencies denominated in the british pound and euro  and foreign denominated assets and liabilities are remeasured each reporting period with any exchange gains and losses recorded in our consolidated statements of operations 
based on currency exposures existing at december  and  a movement in foreign exchange rates would not expose us to significant gains or losses in earnings or cash flows 
we may use derivative instruments to manage the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
however  at december   we had no outstanding derivative instruments 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes
