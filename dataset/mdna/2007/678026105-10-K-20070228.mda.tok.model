our background oil states international  inc was originally incorporated in july in july  oil states international  inc  including its principal operating subsidiaries  oil states industries  inc oil states industries  hwc energy services  inc hwc  pti group inc 
pti and sooner inc sooner entered into a combination agreement the combination agreement providing that  concurrently with the closing of our initial public offering  hwc  pti and sooner would merge with wholly owned subsidiaries of oil states the combination 
as a result  hwc  pti and sooner became wholly owned subsidiaries of oil states in february in this annual report on form k  references to the company or to we  us  our  and similar terms are to oil states international  inc and its subsidiaries following the combination 
acquisitions since the completion of our initial public offering in february  we have completed acquisitions for total consideration of million 
acquisitions of other oil service businesses have been an important aspect of our growth strategy and plans to increase shareholder value 
in  we acquired six businesses for total consideration of approximately million 
three of these businesses were rental tool companies added to our well site services segment 
an elastomer molding company  certain assets and related liabilities of a subsea pipeline equipment and repair services company and an offshore crane manufacturer and crane repair service provider were acquired and became part of our offshore products segment 
in  we spent million to acquire five businesses 
three of the businesses were rental tool companies acquired for a total consideration of million 
the acquired rental tool companies conduct operations in south texas and louisiana and were combined with our existing rental tool business within our well site services segment 
the remaining two businesses  acquired for aggregate consideration of million  were combined with our offshore products segment 
in  we acquired six rental tool businesses  a tubular distribution business and a small tooling line for total consideration of million 
in january  we acquired the stock of five related rental tool companies for million and in april we acquired the assets of a rental tool business for million 
in may  we purchased an oil country tubular goods octg distribution business for million 
in october  we acquired a tooling product line into our offshore products segment for million 
in  we completed nine acquisitions for total consideration of million 
in our well site services segment we acquired a wyoming based land drilling company  five related entities providing wellhead isolation equipment and services  and a canadian manufacturer of work force accommodations 
our tubular services segment acquired a texas based octg distributor  and our offshore products segment acquired a small product line 
in august  we acquired three drilling rigs operating in west texas for total consideration of million  including a note payable to the seller of million 
the rigs acquired  which are classified as part of our capital expenditures in  were added to our existing west texas drilling fleet in our drilling services business 
workover services business transaction effective march   we completed a transaction to combine our workover services business with boots coots international well control  inc amex wel boots coots in exchange for million shares of boots coots common stock and senior subordinated promissory notes totaling million 
our workover services business was part of our well site services segment prior to the combination 
as a result of the closing of the transaction  we acquired approximately million shares of boots coots common stock  which currently represent of its outstanding common stock 
the senior subordinated promissory notes received in the transaction bear a fixed annual interest rate of and mature four and one half years from the closing of the transaction 
in connection with this transaction  we also entered into a registration rights agreement requiring boots coots to file a shelf registration statement within days for all of the boots coots shares we received in the transaction and also allowing us certain rights to include our shares of common stock of boots coots in a registration statement filed by boots coots 
the shelf registration statement has been filed by boots coots and was declared effective in the fourth quarter of the transaction terms also allowed us to designate three additional members to boots coots existing five member board of directors 
all three directors designated by us have joined the boots coots board of directors as of january  the transaction resulted in a non cash pretax gain of million of which million has not been recognized in accordance with the guidance set forth in emerging issues task force issue no 
covering gain recognition involving non cash transactions and retained equity interests 
after the gain adjustment and income taxes  the transaction had a million  or per diluted share  impact on net income and earnings per share  respectively  in we account for our investment in boots coots utilizing the equity method of accounting 
differences between boots coots total book equity after the transaction  net to our interest  and the carrying value of our investment in boots coots are principally attributable to the unrecognized gain on the sale of the workover services business and to goodwill 
on february   boots coots announced it had filed a registration statement to sell million shares of common stock including million shares we own 
the closing price of boots coots common stock on the date of the announcement was 
we own a total of million shares of boots coots common stock with a carrying value of per share as of december  there can be no assurance about the timing of this announced stock sale or whether this transaction will ultimately take place 
our industry we operate in the oilfield services industry and provide a broad range of products and services to our customers through our offshore products  tubular services and well site services business segments 
demand for our products and services is cyclical and substantially dependent upon activity levels in the oil and gas industry  particularly our customers willingness to spend capital on the exploration and development of oil and gas reserves 
demand for our products and services by our customers is highly sensitive to current and expected oil and natural gas prices 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for financial information by segment and a geographical breakout of revenues and long lived assets 
our financial results reflect the cyclical nature of the oilfield services business 
since  there have been periods of increasing and decreasing activity in each of our operating segments 
our well site services businesses  which are significantly affected by the north american rig count  saw decreased activity in and early and saw increasing activity from through acquisitions and capital expenditures made in this segment have created additional growth opportunities 
in addition  the increased activity supporting oil sands developments in northern alberta  canada by our work force accommodations  catering and logistics business in this segment have had a positive impact on this segment s overall trends 
our offshore products segment  which is more influenced by deepwater development activity and rig construction and repair  experienced increased activity during as we shipped projects from our backlog which had increased in in  activity in this segment slowed  however  backlog has increased significantly from to and is at record high levels currently  which has resulted in improved operating results during and our tubular services business is influenced by some of the same factors as our well site services 
in addition  during and  this segment was positively affected in a significant manner by increasing prices for steel products  including the octg we sell 
during  prices for steel products remained comparatively stable compared to the previous two years 
well site services overview during the year ended december   we generated approximately of our revenue and of our operating income  before corporate charges  from our well site services segment 
our well site services segment includes a broad range of products and services that are used to establish and maintain the flow of oil and gas from a well throughout its lifecycle and to accommodate personnel in remote locations 
our services include drilling services  rental equipment  work force accommodations  catering and logistics services and modular building construction services 
we use our fleet of drilling rigs  rental equipment and work force accommodation facilities to serve our customers at well sites and project development locations 
our products and services are used in both onshore and offshore applications throughout the exploration  development  production and abandonment phases of a well s life 
additionally  our work force accommodations  catering and logistics services are employed to support work forces in a variety of mining and related natural resource applications as well as forest fire fighting and disaster relief efforts 
well site services market demand for our drilling rigs  rental equipment and work force accommodations  catering and logistics services has historically been tied to the level of activity by oil and gas explorationists and producers 
the primary driver for this activity is the price of oil and natural gas 
activity levels have been and we expect will continue to be highly correlated with hydrocarbon commodity prices 
products and services drilling services 
our drilling services business is located in odessa  texas  wooster  ohio and casper  wyoming and provides drilling services for shallow to medium depths ranging from  to  feet 
drilling services are typically used during the exploration and development stages of a field

twenty of these drilling rigs are located in odessa  texas  eight in the rocky mountains region and four are located in wooster  ohio 
on december   rigs were working or under contract 
utilization increased slightly from in to in we have assembled seven of our new rigs that have been added to our fleet during through in our odessa  texas facility with components purchased from specialty vendors 
two additional rigs were under construction in odessa  texas at december   both of which are expected to commence two year contracts with an independent e p company in the rocky mountains region by july and september in august  we acquired three drilling rigs from eagle rock drilling which were added to our existing west texas drilling fleet 
we may continue to add rigs depending upon our market outlook 
we market our drilling services directly to a diverse customer base  consisting of both major and independent oil companies 
during we switched from billing on a footage basis to billing on a dayrate basis for many of our drilling rigs 
under a daywork drilling contract  the customer pays for certain costs that the company would normally provide when drilling on a footage basis  and the customer assumes more risk than on a footage basis 
depending on market conditions and availability of drilling rigs  we may see changes in pricing  utilization and contract terms  which could include requests for footage contracts 
the land drilling business is highly fragmented and consists of a small number of large companies and many smaller companies 
rental equipment 
our rental equipment business provides a wide range of products for use in the offshore and onshore oil and gas industry  including wireline and coiled tubing pressure control equipment  wellhead isolation equipment  pipe recovery systems  thru tubing fishing services  gravel pack operations on well bores  and  surface control equipment and down hole tools utilized by coiled tubing operators

flexible bearings and connector products 
we are the principal supplier of flexible bearings  or flexjoints  to the offshore oil and gas industry 
we also supply connections and fittings that join lengths of large diameter conductor or casing used in offshore drilling operations 
flexjoints are flexible bearings that permit movement of riser pipes or tension leg platform tethers under high tension and pressure 
they are used on drilling  production and export risers and are used increasingly as offshore production moves to deeper water areas 
drilling riser systems provide the vertical conduit between the floating drilling vessel and the subsea wellhead 
through the drilling riser  equipment is guided into the well and drilling fluids are returned to the surface 
production riser systems provide the vertical conduit from the subsea wellhead to the floating production platform 
oil and gas flows to the surface for processing through the production riser 
export risers provide the vertical conduit from the floating production platform to the subsea export pipelines 
flexjoints are a critical element in the construction and operation of production and export risers on floating production systems in deepwater 
floating production systems  including tension leg platforms  spars and fpso facilities  are a significant means of producing oil and gas  particularly in deepwater environments 
we provide many important products for the construction of these facilities 
a tension leg platform is a floating platform that is moored by vertical pipes  or tethers  attached to both the platform and the sea floor 
our flexjoint tether bearings are used at the top and bottom connections of each of the tethers  and our merlin connectors are used to join shorter pipe sections to form long pipes offshore 
a spar is a floating vertical cylindrical structure which is approximately six to seven times longer than its diameter and is anchored in place 
our flexjoints are also used to attach the steel catenary risers to a spar or fpso and for use on import or export risers 
subsea pipeline products 
we design and manufacture a variety of fittings and connectors used in offshore oil and gas pipelines 
our products are used for new construction  maintenance and repair applications 
new construction fittings include forged steel y shaped connectors for joining two pipelines into one  pressure balanced safety joints for protecting pipelines and related equipment from anchor snags or a shifting sea bottom  electrical isolation joints  and hot tap clamps that allow new pipelines to be joined into existing lines without interrupting the flow of petroleum product 
we provide diverless connection systems for subsea flowlines and pipelines 
our hydrotech collet connectors provide a high integrity  proprietary metal to metal sealing system for the final hook up of deep offshore pipelines and production systems 
they also are used in diverless pipeline repair systems and in future pipeline tie in systems 
our lateral tie in sled  which is installed with the original pipeline  allows a subsea tie in to be made quickly and efficiently using proven hydrotech connectors without costly offshore equipment mobilization and without shutting off product flow 
we provide pipeline repair hardware  including deepwater applications beyond the depth of diver intervention 
our products include repair clamps used to seal leaks and restore the structural integrity of a pipeline  mechanical connectors used in repairing subsea pipelines without having to weld  flanges used to correct misalignment and swivel ring flanges  and pipe recovery tools for recovering dropped or damaged pipelines 
marine winches  mooring and lifting systems and rig equipment 
we design  engineer and manufacture marine winches  mooring and lifting systems and rig equipment 
our skagit winches are specifically designed for mooring floating and semi submersible drilling rigs and positioning pipelay and derrick barges  anchor handling boats and jack ups  while our nautilus marine cranes are used on production platforms throughout the world 
we also design and fabricate rig equipment such as automatic pipe racking and blow out preventor handling equipment 
our engineering teams  manufacturing capability and service technicians who install and service our products provide our customers with a broad range of equipment and services to support their operations 
aftermarket service and support of our installed base of equipment to our customers is also an important source of revenues to us 
bop stack assembly  integration  testing and repair services 
we design and fabricate lifting and protection frames and offer system integration of blow out preventor stacks and subsea production trees 
we can provide complete turnkey and design fabrication services 
we also design and manufacture a variety of custom subsea equipment  such as riser flotation tank systems  guide bases  running tools and manifolds 
in addition  we also offer blow out preventor and drilling riser testing and repair services 
other products and services 
we provide equipment for securing subsea structures and offshore platform jackets  including our hydra lok hydraulic system 
the hydra lok tool  which has been successfully used at depths of  feet  does not require diver intervention or guide lines 
we also provide cost effective  standardized leveling systems for offshore structures that are anchored by foundation piles  including subsea templates  subsea manifolds and platform jackets 
our offshore products segment also produces a variety of products for use in applications other than in the offshore oil and gas industry 
for example  we provide elastomer consumable downhole products for onshore drilling and production  metal elastomeric flexjoints used in a variety of military and marine applications  and drum clutches and brakes for heavy duty power transmission in the mining  paper  logging and marine industries 
backlog 
backlog in our offshore products segment was million at december   compared to million at december  and million at december  we expect the majority of our backlog at december  to be completed in our offshore products backlog consists of firm customer purchase orders for which contractual commitments exist and delivery is scheduled 
in some instances  these purchase orders are cancelable by the customer  subject to the payment of termination fees and or the reimbursement of our costs incurred 
although our backlog is an important indicator of future offshore products shipments and revenues  backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of our actual operating results for any future period 
we believe that the offshore construction and development business is characterized by lengthy projects and a long lead time order cycle 
the change in backlog levels from one period to the next does not necessarily evidence a long term trend 
regions of operations our offshore products segment provides products and services to customers in the major offshore oil and gas producing regions of the world  including the gulf of mexico  west africa  azerbaijan  the north sea  brazil and southeast asia 
customers and competitors we market our products and services to a broad customer base  including the direct end users  engineering and design companies  prime contractors  and at times  our competitors through outsourcing arrangements 
tubular services overview during the year ended december   we generated approximately of our revenue and of our operating income  before corporate charges  from our tubular services segment 
through this segment  we distribute octg and provide associated octg finishing and logistics services to the oil and gas industry 
octg consist of downhole casing and production tubing 
through our tubular services segment  we distribute a broad range of casing and tubing  provide threading  remediation  logistical and inventory services  and offer e commerce pricing  ordering  tracking and financial reporting capabilities 
we serve a customer base ranging from major oil companies to small independents 
through our key relationships with more than domestic and foreign manufacturers and related service providers and suppliers of octg  we deliver tubular products and ancillary services to oil and gas companies  drilling contractors and consultants predominantly in the united states 
the octg distribution market is highly fragmented and competitive  and is focused in the united states 
we purchase tubular goods from a variety of sources 
however  during  we purchased from a single domestic supplier of the tubular goods we distributed and from three domestic suppliers approximately of such tubular goods 
octg market our tubular services segment primarily distributes casing and tubing 
casing forms the structural wall in oil and gas wells to provide support  control pressure and prevent caving during drilling operations 
casing is also used to protect water bearing formations during the drilling of a well 
casing is generally not removed after it has been installed in a well 
production tubing  which is used to bring oil and gas to the surface  may be replaced during the life of a producing well 
a key indicator of domestic demand for octg is the average number of drilling rigs operating in the united states 
the octg market at any point in time is also affected by the level of inventories maintained by manufacturers  distributors and end users 
demand for tubular products is positively impacted by increased drilling of deeper  horizontal and offshore wells 
deeper wells require incremental tubular footage and enhanced mechanical capabilities to ensure the integrity of the well 
premium tubulars are used in horizontal drilling to withstand the increased bending and compression loading associated with a horizontal well 
operators typically specify premium tubulars for the completion of offshore wells 
products and services tubular products and services 
we distribute various types of octg produced by both domestic and foreign manufacturers to major and independent oil and gas exploration and production companies and other octg distributors 
we do not manufacture any of the tubular goods that we distribute 
as a result  gross margins in this segment are generally lower than those reported by our other segments 
we operate our tubular services segment from a total of eight offices and facilities located near areas of oil and gas exploration and development activity 
we have distribution relationships with most major domestic and certain international steel mills 
in this business  inventory management is critical to our success 
we maintain on the ground inventory in approximately yards located in the united states  giving us the flexibility to fill our customers orders from our own stock or directly from the manufacturer 
we have a proprietary inventory management system  designed specifically for the octg industry  that enables us to track our product shipments down to the individual joint of pipe 
a z terminal 
our a z terminal pipe maintenance and storage facility in crosby  texas is equipped to provide a full range of tubular services  giving us strong customer service capabilities 
our a z terminal is on acres  is an iso certified facility and has more than  pipe racks and two double ended thread lines 
we have exclusive use of a permanent third party inspection center within the facility 
the facility also includes indoor chrome storage capability and patented pipe cleaning machines 
we offer services at our a z terminal facility typically outsourced by other distributors  including the following threading  inspection  cleaning  cutting  logistics  rig returns  installation of float equipment and non destructive testing 
other facilities 
we also offer tubular services at our facilities in midland  texas and godley  texas which were added in the phillips acquisition 
our midland  texas facility covers approximately acres and has more than pipe racks 
our godley  texas facility  which services the barnett shale area  has approximately pipe racks on approximately developed acres and is serviced by a rail spur 
independent third party inspection companies operate within these facilities 
tubular products and services sales arrangements 
we provide our tubular products and logistics services through a variety of arrangements  including spot market sales and alliances 
we provide some of our tubular products and services to independent and major oil and gas companies under alliance arrangements 
although our alliances are generally not as profitable as the spot market and can be cancelled by the customer  they provide us with more stable and predictable revenues and an improved ability to forecast required inventory levels  which allows us to manage our inventory more efficiently 
regions of operations our tubular services segment provides tubular products and services principally to customers in the united states both for land and offshore applications 
however  we also sell a small percentage for export to other countries  including brazil  cameroon  chad  columbia  congo  ecuador  egypt  equatorial guinea  gabon  germany  guatemala  hungary  netherlands  russia  scotland  trinidad  tunisia and venezuela 
customers  suppliers and competitors our three largest end user customers in the tubular distribution market in were conocophillips  chevrontexaco corporation and chesapeake energy corporation 
our three largest suppliers were us steel group  lone star steel and tenaris global services usa corporation formerly maverick tube corporation 
although we have a leading market share position in tubular services distribution  the market is highly fragmented 
our main competitors in tubular distribution are privately owned distributors including premier pipe lp  red man pipe supply co  inc  bourland and leverich and pipeco services 
employees as of december   we had approximately  full time employees  of whom are in our offshore products segment  of whom are in our well site services segment  of whom are in our tubular services segment and of whom are in our corporate headquarters 
we are party to collective bargaining agreements covering employees located in canada and the united kingdom as of december  we believe relations with our employees are good 
government regulation our business is significantly affected by foreign  federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the oil and natural gas industry  worker safety and environmental protection 
changes in these laws  including more stringent regulations and increased levels of enforcement of these laws and regulations  could significantly affect our business 
we cannot predict changes in the level of enforcement of existing laws and regulations or how these laws and regulations may be interpreted or the effect changes in these laws and regulations may have on us or our future operations or earnings 
we also are not able to predict whether additional laws and regulations will be adopted 
we depend on the demand for our products and services from oil and natural gas companies 
this demand is affected by changing taxes  price controls and other laws and regulations relating to the oil and gas industry generally  including those specifically directed to oilfield and offshore operations 
the adoption of laws and regulations curtailing exploration and development drilling for oil and natural gas in our areas of operation could also adversely affect our operations by limiting demand for our products and services 
we cannot determine the extent to which our future operations and earnings may be affected by new legislation  new regulations or changes in existing regulations or enforcement 
some of our employees who perform services on offshore platforms and vessels are covered by the provisions of the jones act  the death on the high seas act and general maritime law 
these laws operate to make the liability limits established under states workers compensation laws inapplicable to these employees and permit them or their representatives generally to pursue actions against us for damages or job related injuries with no limitations on our potential liability 
our operations are subject to numerous foreign  federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations governing the release and or discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
numerous governmental agencies issue regulations to implement and enforce these laws  for which compliance is often costly and difficult 
the violation of these laws and regulations may result in the denial or revocation of permits  issuance of corrective action orders  assessment of administrative and civil penalties  and even criminal prosecution 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
further  we do not anticipate that compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
however  there can be no assurance that substantial costs for compliance will not be incurred in the future 
moreover  it is possible that other developments  such as the adoption of stricter environmental laws  regulations and enforcement policies or more stringent enforcement of existing environmental laws and regulations  could result in additional costs or liabilities that we cannot currently quantify 
we generate wastes  including hazardous wastes  that are subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act  or rcra  and comparable state statutes 
the united states environmental protection agency  or epa  and state agencies have limited the approved methods of disposal for some types of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes 
some wastes handled by us in our field service activities that currently are exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes under rcra or other applicable statutes 
this would subject us to more rigorous and costly operating and disposal requirements 
with regard to our us operations  the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  or cercla  also know as the superfund law  and comparable state statutes impose liability  without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct  on classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these persons include the owner or operator of the disposal site or the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed of or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the site where the release occurred 
under cercla  these persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources  and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment 
we currently have operations in the united states on properties where activities involving the handling of hazardous substances or wastes may have been conducted prior to our operations on such properties or by third parties whose operations were not under our control 
these properties may be subject to cercla  rcra and analogous state laws 
under these laws and related regulations  we could be required to remove or remediate previously discarded hazardous substances and wastes or property contamination that was caused by these third parties 
these laws and regulations may also expose us to liability for our acts that were in compliance with applicable laws at the time the acts were performed 
in the course of our domestic operations  some of our equipment may be exposed to naturally occurring radiation associated with oil and gas deposits  and this exposure may result in the generation of wastes containing naturally occurring radioactive materials or norm 
norm wastes exhibiting trace levels of naturally occurring radiation in excess of established state standards are subject to special handling and disposal requirements  and any storage vessels  piping  and work area affected by norm may be subject to remediation or restoration requirements 
because many of the properties presently or previously owned  operated  or occupied by us have been used for oil and gas production operations for many years  it is possible that we may incur costs or liabilities associated with elevated levels of norm 
the federal water pollution control act and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state waters or waters of the united states 
the discharge of pollutants into jurisdictional waters is prohibited unless the discharge is permitted by the epa or applicable state agencies 
many of our domestic properties and operations require permits for discharges of wastewater and or stormwater  and we have a system for securing and maintaining these permits 
in addition  the oil pollution act of imposes a variety of requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages  including natural resource damages  resulting from such spills in waters of the united states 
a responsible party includes the owner or operator of a facility or vessel  or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located 
the federal water pollution control act and analogous state laws provide for administrative  civil and criminal penalties for unauthorized discharges and  together with the oil pollution act  impose rigorous requirements for spill prevention and response planning  as well as substantial potential liability for the costs of removal  remediation  and damages in connection with any unauthorized discharges 
some of our operations also result in emissions of regulated air pollutants 
the federal clean air act and analogous state laws require permits for facilities in the united states that have the potential to emit substances into the atmosphere that could adversely affect environmental quality 
failure to obtain a permit or to comply with permit requirements could result in the imposition of substantial administrative  civil and even criminal penalties 
in response to recent studies suggesting that emissions of certain gases may be contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere  many foreign nations  including canada  have agreed to limit emissions of these gases  generally referred to as greenhouse gases  pursuant to the united nations framework convention on climate change  also known as the kyoto protocol 
methane  a primary component of natural gas  and carbon dioxide a byproduct of the burning of fossil fuels  are examples of greenhouse gases 
although the united states is not participating in the kyoto protocol  the current session of congress is considering climate change legislation  with multiple bills having already been introduced in the senate that propose to restrict greenhouse gas emissions 
by comparison  several states have already adopted legislation  regulations and or regulatory initiatives to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases 
also  on november   the us supreme court heard arguments on a case appealed from the us circuit court of appeals for the district columbia  massachusetts  et al 
v 
epa  in which the appellate court held that the us environmental protection agency had discretion under the federal clean air act to refuse to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from mobile sources 
passage of climate change legislation by congress or a supreme court reversal of the appellate decision could result in federal regulation of carbon dioxide emissions and other greenhouse gases 
also  any federal or state restrictions on emissions of greenhouse gases that may be imposed in areas of the united states in which we conduct business could adversely affect our operations and demand for our services 
our operations outside of the united states are potentially subject to similar foreign governmental controls relating to protection of the environment 
we believe that  to date  our operations outside of the united states have been in substantial compliance with existing requirements of these foreign governmental bodies and that such compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our operations 
however  there is no assurance that this trend of compliance will continue in the future or that such compliance will not be material 
for instance  any future restrictions on emissions of greenhouse gases that are imposed in foreign countries in which we operate  such as in canada  pursuant to the kyoto protocol or other locally enforceable requirements could adversely affect demand for our services 
item a 
risk factors risks related to our business generally decreased oil and gas industry expenditure levels will adversely affect our results of operations 
we depend upon the oil and gas industry and its ability and willingness to make expenditures which are directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices 
demand for our products and services is particularly sensitive to the level of exploration  development and production activity of  and the corresponding capital spending by  oil and natural gas companies  including national oil companies 
if our customers expenditures decline  our business will suffer 
the industry s willingness to explore  develop and produce depends largely upon the availability of attractive drilling prospects and the prevailing view of future product prices 
prices for oil and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  market uncertainty  and a variety of other factors that are beyond our control 
a sudden or long term decline in product pricing could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
any prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices will depress levels of exploration  development  and production activity  often reflected as reductions in rig counts 
such lower activity levels could materially adversely affect our revenue and profitability 
many factors affect the supply and demand for oil and gas and therefore influence product prices  including the level of production  the levels of oil and gas inventories  the expected cost of developing new reserves  the actual cost of finding and producing oil and gas  the availability of attractive oil and gas field prospects which may be affected by governmental actions or environmental activists which may restrict drilling  the availability of transportation infrastructure  refining capacity and shifts in end customer preferences toward fuel efficiency and the use of natural gas  depletion rates  the level of drilling activity  global weather conditions and natural disasters  worldwide economic activity including growth in underdeveloped countries  including china and india  national government political requirements  including the ability of the organization of petroleum exporting companies opec to set and maintain production levels and prices for oil and government policies which could nationalize or expropriate oil and gas exploration  production  refining or transportation assets  the impact of armed hostilities involving one or more oil producing nations  the timing and extent of alternative energy sources  including liquefied natural gas lng  environmental regulation  and tax policies 
extended periods of low oil prices or unsuccessful exploration results may decrease deepwater exploration and production activity and adversely affect our business 
similarly  any such extended periods of low oil prices could adversely affect the level of expenditures for oil sands development and production in canada 
our offshore products segment depends on exploration and production expenditures in deepwater areas 
because deepwater projects are more capital intensive and take longer to generate first production than shallow water and onshore projects  the economic analyses conducted by exploration and production companies typically assume lower prices for production from such projects to determine economic viability over the long term 
the economic analyses conducted by exploration and production companies for very large oil sands developments are similar to those performed for deepwater projects with respect to oil price assumptions 
perceptions of longer term lower oil prices by these companies can reduce or defer major expenditures given the long term nature of many large scale development projects  which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
because the oil and gas industry is cyclical  our operating results may fluctuate 
oil prices have been and are expected to remain volatile 
this volatility causes oil and gas companies and drilling contractors to change their strategies and expenditure levels 
we have experienced in the past  and we may experience in the future  significant fluctuations in operating results based on these changes 
we do business in international jurisdictions whose regulatory environments and compliance regimes differ from those in the united states 
our business may suffer because our efforts to comply with united states laws and regulations could restrict our ability to do business in international jurisdictions  relative to our competitors who are not subject to united states laws and regulations 
our international business operations include projects in countries where governmental corruption has been known to exist and where our competitors who are not subject to united states laws and regulations  such as the foreign corrupt practices act  can gain competitive advantages over us by securing business awards  licenses or other preferential treatment in those jurisdictions using methods that united states law and regulations prohibit us from using 
for example  our non us competitors are not subject to the anti bribery restrictions of the foreign corrupt practices act  which make it illegal to give anything of value to foreign officials or employees or agents of nationally owned oil companies in order to obtain or retain any business or other advantage 
we may be subject to competitive disadvantages to the extent that our competitors are able to secure business  licenses or other preferential treatment by making payments to government officials and others in positions of influence 
while we and our subsidiaries are committed to conducting business in a legal and ethical manner  there is a risk of violating the us foreign corrupt practices act or other applicable anti corruption regulations that generally prohibit the making of improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
violations of these laws could result in monetary penalties against us or our subsidiaries and could damage our reputation and  therefore  our ability to do business 
we might be unable to employ a sufficient number of technical personnel 
many of the products that we sell  especially in our offshore products segment  are complex and highly engineered and often must perform in harsh conditions 
we believe that our success depends upon our ability to employ and retain technical personnel with the ability to design  utilize and enhance these products 
in addition  our ability to expand our operations depends in part on our ability to increase our skilled labor force 
the demand for skilled workers is high  and the supply is limited 
we have already experienced high demand and increased wages for labor forces serving our well site services segment  notably in our accommodations business in canada 
significant increases in the wages paid by competing employers could further result in a reduction of our skilled labor force  increases in the wage rates that we must pay or both 
when these events occur  our cost structure increases and our growth potential could be impaired 
the level and pricing of tubular goods imported into the united states could decrease demand for our tubular goods inventory and adversely impact our results of operations 
also  if steel mills were to sell a substantial amount of goods directly to end users in the united states  our results of operations could be adversely impacted 
us law currently restricts imports of low cost tubular goods from a number of foreign countries into the us tubular goods market 
if these restrictions were to be lifted or if the level of imported low cost tubular goods were to otherwise increase  our tubular services segment could be adversely affected to the extent that we then have higher cost tubular goods in inventory or if prices and margins are driven down by increased supplies of tubular goods 
if prices were to decrease significantly  we might not be able to profitably sell our inventory of tubular goods 
in addition  significant price decreases could result in a longer holding period for some of our inventory  which could also have a material adverse effect on our tubular services segment 
we do not manufacture any of the tubular goods that we distribute 
historically  users of tubular goods in the united states  in contrast to outside the united states  have purchased tubular goods through distributors 
if customers were to purchase tubular goods directly from steel mills  our results of operations could be adversely impacted 
we are subject to extensive and costly environmental laws and regulations that may require us to take actions that will adversely affect our results of operations 
our drilling operations and our offshore products business are significantly affected by stringent and complex foreign  federal  provincial  state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of substances into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
we could be exposed to liability for cleanup costs  natural resource damages and other damages as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of  or conditions caused by  prior operators or other third parties 
environmental laws and regulations are subject to change in the future  possibly resulting in more stringent requirements 
if existing regulatory requirements or enforcement policies change or are more stringently enforced  we may be required to make significant unanticipated capital and operating expenditures 
any failure by us to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations may result in governmental authorities taking actions against our business that could adversely impact our operations and financial condition  including the issuance of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  denial or revocation of permits or other authorizations  reduction or cessation in operations  and performance of site investigatory  remedial or other corrective actions 
we may not have adequate insurance for potential liabilities 
our operations are subject to many hazards 
we face the following risks under our insurance coverage we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance on commercially reasonable terms  we may be faced with types of liabilities that will not be covered by our insurance  such as damages from environmental contamination or terrorist attacks  the dollar amount of any liabilities may exceed our policy limits  and we may incur losses from interruption of our business that exceed our insurance coverage 
even a partially uninsured claim  if successful and of significant size  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or consolidated financial position 
we are subject to litigation risks that may not be covered by insurance 
in the ordinary course of business  we become the subject of various claims  lawsuits and administrative proceedings seeking damages or other remedies concerning our commercial operations  products  employees and other matters  including occasional claims by individuals alleging exposure to hazardous materials as a result of our products or operations 
some of these claims relate to the activities of businesses that we have sold  and some relate to the activities of businesses that we have acquired  even though these activities may have occurred prior to our acquisition of such businesses 
we maintain insurance to cover many of our potential losses  and we are subject to various self retentions and deductibles under our insurance 
it is possible  however  that a judgment could be rendered against us in cases in which we could be uninsured and beyond the amounts that we currently have reserved or anticipate incurring for such matters 
we might be unable to compete successfully with other companies in our industry 
we sell our products and services in competitive markets 
in some of our business segments  we compete with the oil and gas industry s largest oilfield services providers 
these companies have greater financial resources than we do 
our business will be adversely affected to the extent that these providers are successful in reducing purchases of our products and services 
risks related to our operations we are susceptible to seasonal earnings volatility due to adverse weather conditions in our regions of operations 
our operations are directly affected by seasonal differences in weather in the areas in which we operate  most notably in canada and the gulf of mexico 
a portion of our canadian work force accommodations  catering and logistics operations is conducted during the winter months when the winter freeze in remote regions is required for exploration and production activity to occur 
the spring thaw in these frontier regions restricts operations in the spring months and  as a result  adversely affects our operations and sales of products and services in the second and third quarters 
our operations in the gulf of mexico are also affected by weather patterns 
weather conditions in the gulf coast region generally result in higher drilling activity in the spring  summer and fall months with the lowest activity in the winter months 
in addition  summer and fall drilling activity can be restricted due to hurricanes and other storms prevalent in the gulf of mexico and along the gulf coast 
for example  during  a significant disruption occurred in oil and gas drilling and production operations in the us gulf of mexico due to damage inflicted by hurricanes katrina and rita 
as a result of these seasonal differences  full year results are not likely to be a direct multiple of any particular quarter or combination of quarters 
we might be unable to protect our intellectual property rights 
we rely on a variety of intellectual property rights that we use in our offshore products and well site services segments  particularly our patents relating to our flexjoint technology and intervention tools utilized in the completion or workover of oil and gas wells 
the market success of our technologies will depend  in part  on our ability to obtain and enforce our proprietary rights in these technologies  to preserve rights in our trade secret and non public information  and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
we may not be able to successfully preserve these intellectual property rights in the future and these rights could be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
if any of our patents or other intellectual property rights are determined to be invalid or unenforceable  or if a court limits the scope of claims in a patent or fails to recognize our trade secret rights  our competitive advantages could be significantly reduced in the relevant technology  allowing competition for our customer base to increase 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries in which our products and services may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
the failure of our company to protect our proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us could adversely affect our competitive position 
if we do not develop new competitive technologies and products  our business and revenues may be adversely affected 
the market for our offshore products is characterized by continual technological developments to provide better performance in increasingly greater depths and harsher conditions 
if we are not able to design  develop and produce commercially competitive products in a timely manner in response to changes in technology  our business and revenues will be adversely affected 
loss of key members of our management could adversely affect our business 
we depend on the continued employment and performance of key members of management 
if any of our key managers resign or become unable to continue in their present roles and are not adequately replaced  our business operations could be materially adversely affected 
we do not maintain key man life insurance for any of our officers 
if we have to write off a significant amount of goodwill  our earnings will be negatively affected 
as of december   goodwill represented approximately of our total assets 
we have recorded goodwill because we paid more for some of our businesses than the fair market value of the tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets of those businesses 
current accounting standards  which were effective january   require a periodic review of goodwill for impairment in value and a non cash charge against earnings with a corresponding decrease in stockholders equity if circumstances indicate that the carrying amount will not be recoverable see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
if we were to lose a significant supplier of our tubular goods  we could be adversely affected 
during  we purchased from a single domestic supplier approximately of the tubular goods we distributed and from three domestic suppliers approximately of such tubular goods 
we do not have contracts with any of these suppliers 
if we were to lose any of these suppliers or if production at one or more of the suppliers were interrupted  our tubular services segment and our overall business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
if the extent of the loss or interruption were sufficiently large  the impact on us would be material 
during periods of strong demand  we may be unable to obtain critical project materials on a timely basis 
our operations depend on our ability to procure on a timely basis certain project materials  such as forgings  to complete projects in an efficient manner 
our inability to procure critical materials during times of strong demand could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 
provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage a takeover attempt  which may reduce or eliminate the likelihood of a change of control transaction and  therefore  the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares for a premium 
provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  such as a classified board  limitations on the removal of directors  on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders and on stockholder action by written consent and the inability of stockholders to call special meetings  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our company 
our certificate of incorporation also authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval 
if our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock  it could increase the difficulty for a third party to acquire us  which may reduce or eliminate our stockholders ability to sell their shares of common stock at a premium
