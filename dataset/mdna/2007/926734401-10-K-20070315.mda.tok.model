the company posted an operating income for fiscal year of million compared to operating income of million for fiscal year total revenue for fiscal year was million or an increase of over the fiscal year revenue of million 
in addition  the company increased liquidity with an increase in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments of million to a total of million at december  versus million at december  the company continues to carry no long term debt 
the improved performance in fiscal as compared to fiscal was the result of many factors 
we grew our services revenue during while continuing to focus on cost control and efficiency in our business 
services revenue increased million or 
license revenue declined million or 
operating expenses increased by million or 
the net result was that income from operations increased million or as the increase in total revenue was greater than the increase in total operating expenses 
the operating margin percentage for fiscal was versus for fiscal license revenues of million in fiscal and million in the fourth quarter of were down and  respectively  as compared to maintenance revenues of million in fiscal and million in the fourth quarter of were up and  respectively  as compared to professional services revenues of million in fiscal and million in the fourth quarter of were up and as compared to international revenue comprised and of total revenue for the year and quarter ended december   respectively 
no single customer accounted for more than of our annual or quarterly revenues 

table of contents the gross profit margin in fiscal of remained unchanged from fiscal as the company did not have any significant changes in the direct costs to produce its software or provide services 
in absolute dollars gross profit increased million as result of the increase in total revenue 
the total costs of revenue increased million to million from million 
the increase was driven by an increase in the costs of revenue for services which increased million to million from million 
as a percentage of services revenue the costs of revenue for services was for fiscal and which reflects that there were no significant changes in the costs to provide services 
this increase was offset by a decrease in the amortization of acquired technology of million to million from million 
the decrease in the amortization of acquired technology is related to the normal run out of costs associated with acquisitions 
there was a decrease in the costs of revenue for product license of million 
total expenses  including both cost of revenue and operating expenses  for fiscal and for the fourth quarter of were million and million  respectively  and included million and million  respectively  for the following benefits charges business restructuring charges benefits  acquisition related charges  amortization of acquired technology and intangibles and stock option expense 
most of these benefits charges relate to our previous acquisitions 
the exception to the previous statement is the stock option expense of million that was recognized in upon the adoption of fas r 
the remaining expenses excluding the expenses discussed above of million for fiscal were up as compared to fiscal and expenses of million for the fourth quarter of were down as compared to the fourth quarter of the increase in the expenses for fiscal after excluding the million as described above was the result of several factors 
the primary driver was an increase of million for the direct costs to produce software and provide services and is associated with the increase in total revenue 
this was offset by a decrease in operating expenses of million 
the million is net of a decrease in general and administrative expenses of million  an increase in research and development expenses of million and an increase in sales and marketing expenses of million 
the decline in general and administrative expenses is driven by lower regulatory reporting costs and professional fees 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses is due to an increase in the marketing efforts for the health care vertical and an increase in regional marketing expenses

the decrease in sales and marketing expenses in the fourth quarter of as compared to was due to lower sales commissions associated with the lower license sales and an effort to reduce costs for general marketing expenses including travel and corporate events 
the decrease in general and administrative costs in the fourth quarter of as compared to is due primarily lower professional fees associated with regulatory filings and other services 
the company continued to offshore research and development to control costs and improve efficiency 
headcount was employees at december  as compared to employees at december  these and other actions have contributed to the increase in operating income of million as discussed above 
our total cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments balance totaled approximately million as of december   and increased approximately million from december   due to the improved operating results and an increase in interest income associated with invested funds 
the increase in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments is after utilizing approximately million to repurchase common stock of the company and the purchase of long term investments totaling million

the primary risk to achieving our goals is competitive pressure  particularly from larger companies with much longer operating histories and greater resources 
moreover  many of these companies can adopt aggressive pricing policies and provide customers with consolidated offerings that may include some of our product capabilities 
other key risks include market acceptance of our products  the overall level of information technology spending  the uncertainties and challenges of offshore outsourcing and our ability to maintain control over expenses and cash 
our prospects must be considered in light of these risks  particularly given that we operate in new and rapidly evolving markets  have completed several acquisitions and face an uncertain economic environment 
we may not be successful in addressing such risks and difficulties

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management has discussed with and agreed upon the development and selection of the following critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors revenue recognition  estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  stock based compensation  estimating business restructuring accruals  and valuation of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 

table of contents revenue recognition 
revenue consists of product and service fees 
product fee income is earned through the licensing or right to use our software and from the sale of specific software products 
service fee income is earned through the sale of maintenance and technical support  consulting services and training services 
we do not recognize revenue for agreements with rights of return  refundable fees  cancellation rights or acceptance clauses until such rights to return  refund or cancel have expired or acceptance has occurred 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop  and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements as revised by sab where software licenses are sold with maintenance or other services  we allocate the total fee to the various elements based on the fair values of the elements specific to us 
we determine the fair value of each element in the arrangement based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value 
vsoe of fair value is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those products and services when sold separately and  for support services  is additionally measured by the renewal rate 
if we do not have vsoe for one of the delivered elements of an arrangement  but do have vsoe for all undelivered elements  we use the residual method to record revenue 
under the residual method  the arrangement fee is first allocated to the undelivered elements based upon their vsoe of fair value  the remaining arrangement fee  including any discount  is allocated to the delivered element 
if the residual method is not used  discounts  if any  are applied proportionately to each element included in the arrangement based on each element s fair value without regard to the discount 
revenue allocated to product license fees is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  no significant remaining obligations with regard to implementation are outstanding  and collection of a fixed or determinable fee is probable 
we consider all payments outside our normal payment terms  including all amounts due in excess of one year  to not be fixed and determinable  and such amounts are recognized as revenue as they become due 
if collectibility is not considered probable  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
for software arrangements where we are obligated to perform professional services for implementation of the product  we evaluate whether delivery has occurred upon shipment of software or upon completion of services and if the customer payment is probable 
this evaluation is made based on various factors such as the nature of the services work  order type eg initial vs 
follow on  customer s payment history  etc 
in the instances where delivery is deemed not to have occurred upon shipment based on the aforementioned factors  license revenue is recognized when we have no significant remaining obligations with regard to the implementation 
revenue from perpetual licenses that include unspecified  additional software products is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement  beginning with the delivery of the first product 
revenue allocated to maintenance and support is recognized ratably over the maintenance term typically one year 
revenue allocated to training and consulting service elements is recognized as the services are performed 
our consulting services are not essential to the functionality of our products as i such services are available from other vendors and ii we have sufficient experience in providing such services 
deferred revenue includes amounts received from customers in excess of revenue recognized 
accounts receivable includes amounts due from customers for which revenue has been recognized 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines  discussed above  in determining revenues  however  certain judgments and estimates are made and used to determine revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue recognized for any period if different conditions were to prevail 
for example  in determining whether collection is probable  we assess 
table of contents our customers ability and intent to pay 
our actual experience with respect to collections could differ from our initial assessment if  for instance  unforeseen declines in the overall economy occur and negatively impact our customers financial condition 
estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we continuously assess the collectibility of outstanding customer invoices and in doing so  we maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the non collection of customer receivables 
in estimating this allowance  we consider factors such as historical collection experience  a customer s current credit worthiness  customer concentrations  age of the receivable balance  both individually and in the aggregate  and general economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
actual customer collections could differ from our estimates 
for example  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
stock based compensation 
the company measures all share based payment awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognizes compensation expenses for all share based payments on a straight line basis over the service period that the awards are expected to vest pursuant to the guidance of statement of financial accounting standards r  share based payment statement r and staff accounting bulletin sab of the securities and exchange commission 
restricted stock and stock options issued under equity plans as well as stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plans are subject to the provisions of statement r and the interpretive guidance of sab the company adopted statement r using the modified prospective method 
under the modified prospective method compensation expense was recognized effective january  for a all share based payments granted or modified after that date and b based on the previous requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees prior to that date that remain unvested as of january  we estimate the fair value of stock options using a black scholes valuation model  consistent with the provisions of statement r and the interpretive guidance of sab option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
judgment is also required in estimating the number of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results or future changes in estimates differ significantly from our current estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
estimating business restructuring accruals 
we vacated excess leased facilities as a result of the restructuring plan we initiated in and subsequently expanded in   and we recorded an accrual for the remaining lease liabilities of such vacated properties as well as brokerage commissions  partially offset by estimated sublease income 
we estimated the costs of these excess leased facilities  including estimated costs to sublease and sublease income  based on market information and trend analysis 
we continually assess our real estate portfolio and may vacate or occupy other leased space as dictated by our analysis 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
in particular  actual sublease income attributable to the consolidation of excess facilities might deviate from the assumptions used to calculate our accrual for facility lease commitments 
valuation of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
the company applies statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets statement  in accounting for the valuation of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
in accordance with statement  we replaced the ratable amortization of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets with a periodic review and analysis for possible impairment 
we assess our goodwill on october of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
the events and circumstances the company considers include significant changes in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators and competition 
in addition  the company periodically reviews the estimated useful lives of its identifiable intangible assets  taking into consideration any events or circumstances that might result in either a diminished fair value or revised useful life 
as required by statement  the impairment test is accomplished using a two stepped approach 
the first step screens for impairment and  when impairment is indicated  a second step is employed to measure the impairment 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items from our consolidated statements of operations  expressed as a percentage of total revenues year ended december  revenue product license services total revenue cost of revenue product license amortization of acquired technology services total cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative purchased in process research and development  acquisition related and other charges business restructuring benefits charges amortization of intangible assets total operating expenses income loss from operations other income expense  net income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss comparison of fiscal years ended december   and in thousands  unless otherwise noted revenue year ended december  compared to compared to product license maintenance and support professional services total services revenue total revenue total revenue increased in and in the increase in revenue in is due to increases in services revenue 
as noted above the increase in are in both maintenance and support and professional services 
license revenues declined in the increase in is due to several factors 
the company made strides in product integration and stability 
the company also continued to simplify and amplify the message that the company provides solutions for customers 
lastly  there was renewed interest in enterprise content management software during fiscal year 
table of contents product license 
product license revenue decreased in and increased in the decrease in can be attributed to two major factors 
the first contributor to the decline is the failure of the company to execute on its plan to further penetrate the healthcare vertical by building on the growth established in fiscal in addition  was a year of transition in which a new senior vice president of global sales and services was hired and there was an attrition of sales executives and support personnel 
the total number of sales and support personnel was as of december  versus as of december  product license revenue increased in the increase in can be attributed to an improving market for enterprise content software  the continued integration of the products  and a focused marketing and sales strategy on industry segments such as healthcare 
services 
services revenue increased in and in the increase in is attributable to both maintenance and support and professional services 
the increase in maintenance and support is attributable primarily to an increase in rates 
the increase in professional services is due primarily to more effective selling of our services to the company s installed base of customers 
the increase in professional services in is due primarily to the larger install base of vignette s software products and professional services sold in conjunction with new product licenses 
the larger install base also increased the amount of maintenance and support revenue 
during fiscal years  and  no single customer accounted for more than of our total revenues 
international revenue was million  million and million  or   and of total revenues  in   and  respectively 
gross profit cost of revenue consists of costs to manufacture  package and distribute our products and related documentation  the costs of licensing third party software incorporated into our products  the amortization of certain acquired technology  and personnel and other expenses related to providing professional and maintenance services 
gross profit amounts and percentages are as follows year ended december  compared to compared to product license amortization of acquired technology maintenance and support professional services total services total gross profit as a percent of sales  gross profit represented   and in  and  respectively 
in the gross margin remained unchanged from as there were no significant changes in the direct costs of the company s products or services 
the increase in gross profit which was million or higher than is consistent with the increase in total revenue in the improvement in is due to improved margins on product licenses and lower amortization charges of acquired technology 
the improvement in the gross profit margin for product license increased in concert with the growth in revenue and by the lower costs of imbedded software 
the decline in the amortization of acquired technology in is due to the normal run out of those amortized costs 

table of contents operating expenses year ended december  compared to compared to research and development sales and marketing general and administrative purchased in process research and development  acquisition related and other charges business restructuring benefits charges amortization of intangible assets total operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs to support product development 
research and development expenses increased in and decreased in the increase in research and development is due to increased salaries and wages as headcount increased in to versus in the year over year decrease in is due primarily to our restructuring efforts via reduced engineering headcount in the first half of  lower facilities expenses and other cost saving measures such as the consolidation of product development facilities and the transition of these activities to an offshore operations model 
the company did not capitalize any software development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  for fiscal years   and  respectively 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for sales  marketing and customer care personnel  sales commissions  public relations  marketing materials and tradeshows as well as bad debt charges 
sales and marketing expenses increased in and decreased in the increase in is due to the increased marketing efforts in the health care vertical and regional marketing expenses during the first half of the decrease in is attributable to reduced bad debt charges and lower marketing and headcount costs 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for human resources  finance  accounting  facilities  information technology and legal employees 
general and administrative expenses decreased in and increased in the decrease in is due to reduced costs for regulatory reporting and lower professional services 
the increase in is attributable to the increased costs of meeting regulatory reporting requirements including the costs to implement the requirements under the sarbanes oxley act of purchased in process research and development  acquisition related and other charges 
during fiscal the company did not recognize any expense associated with business combinations 
the company made a series of complimentary businesses acquisitions in the three years ended december  the following table summarizes costs related to our business combinations in thousands for the most recent three years year ended december  purchased in process research and development cross training  product integration and other severance and other employee related costs contingent compensation 
table of contents impairment of intangible assets 
we use a two step approach to assess our goodwill annually  or more frequently  if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
in step of the assessment the company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if an impairment of goodwill is indicated 
the estimated fair value is based on market capitalization  as complemented by a discounted cash flow analysis 
if no impairment is indicated in step no additional analysis is performed 
should an impairment be indicated the company would measure the loss in step by comparing the enterprise s implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine the amount of impairment loss to be recorded 
we also review other intangible assets for possible impairment periodically 
sustained negative industry and economic trends  a decline in our stock price and market capitalization for an extended period of time  or changes in our product offerings could result in future impairment charges that are material to our consolidated financial statements 
based on the methods described above there were no impairment charges related to goodwill or other intangible assets in   or business restructuring charges 
in  we initiated a restructuring program to align our expense and revenue levels and to better position us for growth and profitability 
in   and  we expanded those restructuring efforts 
although we have substantially implemented our restructuring activities  there can be no assurance that the estimated costs of our restructuring efforts will not change 
components of business restructuring charges and the remaining restructuring accruals as of december  are as follows in thousands 
table of contents facility lease commitments asset impairments employee separation and other costs total balance at december  total restructuring charge cash activity non cash activity balance at december  effect of expanded restructuring plan adjustment to accrual cash activity non cash activity balance at december  effect of expanded restructuring plan adjustment to accrual cash activity balance at december  effect of expanded restructuring plan adjustment to accrual cash activity non cash activity balance at december  adjustment to accrual cash activity balance at december  adjustment to accrual cash activity non cash activity balance at december  less current portion accrued restructuring costs  less current portion remaining cash expenditures resulting from the restructuring are estimated to be million and relate to our facility lease commitments  of which the remaining maximum lease commitment extends out to we have substantially implemented our restructuring efforts initiated in conjunction with this restructuring plan  however  there can be no assurance that the estimated costs of our restructuring efforts will not change 
these are management s best estimates based on currently available information and are subject to change 
consolidation of excess facilities facility lease commitments relate to lease obligations for excess office space that the company has vacated as a result of the restructuring plan 
the company continues to actively pursue mitigation strategies to dispose of all excess office space through subleasing and or early termination negotiations where possible 
the total lease commitments include the estimated lease buyout fees  or the remaining lease liabilities and estimated associated mitigation costs including  but not limited to  brokerage commissions  legal fees  repairs  restoration costs  and sublease incentives  offset by estimated sublease income 
the estimated costs of vacating these leased facilities  including estimated costs to sublease and any resulting 
table of contents sublease income  were based on market information and trend analysis as estimated by the company 
the company continually assesses its real estate portfolio and may vacate and or occupy other leased space as dictated by its analysis and by the needs of the business 
it is reasonably possible that actual results could continue to differ from these estimates in the near term  and such differences could be material to the financial statements 
in particular  actual sublease income attributable to the consolidation of excess facilities might deviate from the assumptions used to calculate the company s accrual for facility lease commitments 
the accrual adjustments recorded during fiscal relate primarily to such differences  namely the buyout fees and sublease income of certain vacated properties were more favorable than we had anticipated 
facility lease commitments relate to the company s departure from certain office space in austin  texas  brisbane and san francisco  california  new york city  new york  waltham and boston  massachusetts  chicago  illinois  and slough  united kingdom 
the maximum lease commitment of such vacated properties extends through december asset impairments asset impairments relate to the impairment of certain fixed assets  prepaid royalties and intangible assets 
these fixed assets were impaired as a result of the company s decision to vacate certain office space and align its infrastructure with current and projected headcount 
employee separation and other costs employee separation and other costs include severance  related taxes  outplacement and other restructuring charges 
as a result of the restructuring activities  the company severed approximately  employees 
employee groups impacted by the restructuring efforts include personnel in positions throughout the sales  marketing  professional services  engineering and general and administrative functions in all geographies 
stock based compensation 
the company adopted statement r effective january  under statement r the company records expense for stock compensation based on the grant date fair value 
the company determines grant date fair value for stock options and the espp using the black scholes option pricing model 
the fair value for restricted stock awards rsas is generally equal to their intrinsic value at the date of grant 
for the year ended december   the company recorded million for stock options  million for restricted stock awards  and million for the employee stock purchase plan 
all of the expense for the years ended december  and is attributable to rsas 
prior to the adoption of statement r the company did not record any expense for stock options with zero intrinsic value or the espp 
prior to the adoption of statement r the company accelerated the vesting of approximately  shares with a weighted average exercise price 
the purpose of the acceleration was to avoid recognizing compensation cost upon the adoption of r 
the pre tax charge estimated by the company to be avoided as a result of the acceleration amounts to approximately million over the course of the vesting periods 
the estimated charge avoided is million in  million in  and million in all other previously awarded stock options were not impacted by this change 
the company still expects to issue stock options but has shifted to offering some stock based compensation in the form of rsas 
stock compensation expense is attributable to the following cost categories in thousands year ended december  cost of revenue services research and development sales and marketing general and administrative 
table of contents amortization of intangible assets 
intangible amortization expense decreased in as compared to and decreased in compared to the decrease in compared to relates to the decline in amortization expense for assets assumed from the intraspect and tower technology acquisitions as the remaining unamortized cost continues to decline 
the decrease in compared to relates to the decline in amortization for assets assumed from the intraspect and tower technology acquisitions as the remaining unamortized continues to decline 
other income and expense other income and expense  net consists primarily of interest income and expense  recognized investment gains and losses as well as foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
year ended december  compared to compared to interest income and other  net purchase accounting credits gain on sale of equity investments other income and expense  net decreased in as compared to due to a lack of a one time gain on the sale of equity investments as discussed below 
interest income and other  net increased by due to the higher cash balances and higher yields on invested funds 
in the company recognized purchase accounting credits due to the release of liabilities associated with the company s acquisitions 
other income and expense  net increased in as compared to due to higher cash and short term investment balances and increasing yields on invested funds and a one time gain on the sale of equity investments 
the gain on the sale of equity investments was due to the sale of equity securities in privately held technology companies 
the largest of which was a sale of shopzilla for approximately million to ew scripps company 
the company owned approximately of shopzilla and recognized a gain of approximately million 
the company had no carrying cost in the asset at the time of the sale due to previous impairment charges 
at december   our unrestricted  long term investments totaled million 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of an investee could require future impairment charges 
provision for income taxes income tax expense consists primarily of estimated withholdings and income taxes due in certain foreign jurisdictions 
year ended december  compared to compared to provision for income taxes we have provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset  including all net operating loss  research and development credit  and capital loss carry forwards based on the determination that it is more likely than not that the benefit related to such assets will not be realized 
our accounting for deferred taxes under sfas involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the realization of our deferred tax assets 
in concluding that a full valuation allowance was appropriate  we have considered such factors as our history of incurring operating losses and our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character within the relevant jurisdictions in future years 

table of contents quarterly results the table on pages f to f of the consolidated financial statements section sets forth certain unaudited consolidated statements of operations data  both in absolute dollars and as a percent of revenue  for each of the last consecutive eight quarters 
we base our forecast for expenses in part on future as opposed to historical revenue projections due to the continued changes in our business 
many of these expenses are fixed in the short term  and we may not be able to quickly reduce spending if revenues are lower than we have projected 
our ability to accurately forecast our quarterly revenue is limited due to the long sales cycle of our software products  which makes it difficult to predict the quarter in which product implementation will occur  and the variability of customer demand for professional services 
we would expect our business  operating results and financial condition to be materially adversely affected if revenues do not meet projections and that net losses in a given quarter would be even greater than expected 
our operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter in the past and we expect our operating results will continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
a number of factors are likely to cause these variations  including demand for our products and services  the timing of sales of our products and services  the timing of customer orders and product implementations  seasonal fluctuations in information technology purchasing  unexpected delays in introducing new products and services  increased expenses  whether related to sales and marketing  product development or administration  changes in the rapidly evolving market for web based applications  the mix of product license and services revenue  as well as the mix of products licensed  the mix of services provided and whether services are provided by our own staff or third party contractors  the mix of domestic and international sales  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  costs related to possible acquisitions of technology or businesses  global events  including terrorist activities and military operations  and the general economic climate  changes to our licensing and pricing model 
accordingly  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful 
investors should not rely on the results of one quarter as an indication of future performance 

table of contents net operating losses and tax credit carry forwards as of december   we had domestic federal net operating loss  research and development credit  and capital loss carry forwards of approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
these domestic net operating loss  research and development credit  and capital loss carry forwards will expire at various dates  between and  if not utilized 
the company also had foreign net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million that are not subject to expiration 
internal revenue code section and similar foreign statutes impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses  tax credits  and capital loss carry forwards in the event of an ownership change of a corporation 
domestic net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million  and tax credit carry forwards of million at december  were incurred by businesses we acquired and will be subject to annual limitation 
these restrictions may severely limit the benefit of these acquired tax attributes in future periods 
the remaining tax attributes that may be subject to such annual limitations include domestic net operating loss carry forwards of million  foreign net operating loss carry forwards of million  capital loss carry forwards of million and research and development credit carry forwards of million 
based upon a review of historical stock ownership  we do not believe that any resulting annual limitation will severely limit our ability to utilize these tax attributes prior to their expiration 
in the event that an ownership change occurs in the future  application of the change in ownership statutes might result in substantial limitation on the utilization of these tax attributes from that point forward 
we have provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset  including all net operating loss  research and development credit  and capital loss carry forwards based on the determination that it is more likely than not that the benefit related to such assets will not be realized 
our accounting for deferred taxes under sfas involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in concluding that a full valuation allowance was appropriate  we have considered such factors as our history of incurring operating losses and our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character within the relevant jurisdictions in future years 
as of december   approximately million of the valuation allowance is related to acquired deferred tax assets of epicentric  intraspect  and tower technology 
if the benefit of these acquired deferred tax assets are realized in the future  the initial recognition will be recorded first as a reduction to the relevant entity s goodwill  then as a reduction to the relevant entity s other non current intangible assets  and lastly  as a reduction of current income tax expense 
in the year ended december   we recognized approximately million of acquired deferred tax assets as a reduction to goodwill 
approximately million of the valuation allowance relates to net operating loss carry forwards generated by the deduction of stock option compensation 
the initial recognition of these deferred tax assets will be credited directly to contributed capital
