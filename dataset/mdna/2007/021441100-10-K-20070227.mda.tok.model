table of contents part i item business 
founded in  altera corporation designs  manufactures  and markets programmable logic devices  or plds  hardcopy structured application specific integrated circuit  or asic  devices  pre defined design building blocks known as intellectual property  or ip cores  and associated development tools 
our headquarters facility is located at innovation drive  san jose  california  and our web site is www 
altera 
com 
our common stock trades on the nasdaq global market under the symbol altr 
our plds  which consist of field programmable gate arrays  or fpgas  and complex programmable logic devices  or cplds  are semiconductor integrated circuits  or chips  that are manufactured as standard chips that our customers program to perform desired logic functions within their electronic systems 
our hardcopy structured asic devices  which offer greatly reduced die size due to the removal of programmable routing and other circuits in our highest density fpgas  enable our customers to transition from a high density fpga to a low cost non programmable implementation of their designs for volume production 
because they are customized only on the last few mask layers  hardcopy devices deliver performance that is comparable to traditional asic devices  but with reduced development costs and shorter production lead times 
our customers can license ip cores from us for implementation of standard functions in their pld designs 
customers develop  compile  and verify their pld designs  and then program their designs into our plds using our proprietary development software  which operates on personal computers and engineering workstations 

table of contents we were one of the first suppliers of complementary metal oxide semiconductor  or cmos  plds and are currently a global leader in this market 
today  we offer a broad range of plds that offer unique features as well as differing densities and performance specifications 
our products serve a wide range of customers within the communications  computer and storage  consumer  and industrial market segments 
an overview of typical pld applications within these markets is shown in the table below 
market segment market sub segment application product communications networking routers switches wireline access systems metropolitan area networks optical networks wireless cellular base stations wireless local area networks computer and storage computer mainframes servers office automation copiers multi function peripherals printers storage redundant array of inexpensive disks raid systems storage area networks consumer broadcast studio editing equipment satellite equipment broadcasting equipment entertainment flat panel televisions cable set top boxes industrial automotive car entertainment systems navigation systems instrumentation manufacturing systems medical diagnostic systems test equipment military guidance and control systems radar systems secure communications systems security energy management surveillance systems card readers energy management systems digital logic overview three principal types of digital integrated circuits are used in most electronic systems processors  memory  and logic 
processors  which include microprocessors  microcontrollers  and digital signal processors  are typically used for control  central computing tasks  and signal processing  memory is used to store programming instructions and data  and logic is typically used to manage the interchange and manipulation of digital signals within a system 
while system designers employ a relatively small number of standard architectures to meet their processor and memory needs  they require a wide variety of logic circuits to differentiate their end products 

table of contents the majority of the digital logic market is made up of three product sub segments asics  application specific standard products  or assps  and plds 
in a broad sense  all of these products are competitive with each other as they generally may be used in the same types of applications in electronic systems 
however  differences in cost  performance  density  flexibility  ease of use  and time to market dictate the extent to which they may be directly competitive for particular applications 
the table below summarizes key characteristics of asic  assp  and pld products from the perspective of the end customer 
asic assp pld customizable yes  by chip fabrication facility no yes  by end user erasability re programmability no no yes relative time to market slow immediate fast relative unit cost low moderate moderate to high customer s development cost high low moderate asics  also frequently referred to as standard cells  are defined by the end customer and customized during manufacturing at the chip fabrication facility 
as a result  a given asic has a fixed function for use by a single customer in a single application 
assps are defined by the assp supplier and sold as standard devices that usually cannot be customized by the end user 
rather than being built for a single customer as in the case of an asic  an assp is built for a specific type of application and is typically targeted and sold to a limited number of customers 
for simplicity  an assp may be viewed as an asic developed for more than one customer 
in contrast to the fixed nature of both asics and assps  plds are customized by the end customer and hence can be used in a wide range of applications 
as a result  a given pld is typically sold to hundreds or thousands of customers 
the inherent flexibility of plds provides significant advantages to the end customer over asics  including design change simplicity  shorter design cycles  and lower development cost 
in contrast to asic users  pld users program their design directly into the pld and can have custom chips that are fully functioning and verified at the time the design is completed  thereby bypassing the lengthy and complex cycles involved in the verification and fabrication of asics 
as a result of user programmability  pld customers may experiment with and revise their designs in a relatively short amount of time and with minimum development cost 
the ease of use and time to market advantages of plds are complemented by the added benefit of field upgradeability  which generally enables pld users to modify the pld design after the electronic system has been shipped 
due to their programmability  however  plds generally have a larger die size and associated higher per unit cost when compared to asics 
while the customized manufacturing of asics can result in more optimized chip performance and lower per unit cost than plds  asics require higher up front costs and longer manufacturing lead times 
historically  due to their lower per unit costs  asics have been viewed as more cost effective than plds for large volume  low cost applications such as consumer electronics 
consequently  the unit volume of a pld implementation is typically lower than that for an asic implementation 
additionally  some customers may choose to prototype with plds for initial engineering development and then re design to an asic in volume production for lower per unit cost 
while such re designs have always been an aspect of the pld business  we believe that the following factors are driving electronic systems manufacturers to use plds for their systems entire life cycle the continual reduction in the price premium of programmable logic  the ever shortening product life cycle of many electronic systems  and the use of more advanced chip manufacturing technology  which heightens the failure risk of asics and the up front costs of design  verification and mask development  known as non recurring engineering costs 
assps have been used in applications where specific fixed functions are needed and where little differentiation is required  such as in implementing certain electronic industry standards 
however  the fixed functionality of assps limits the range of applications they can address 
in contrast to assps  the flexibility found in plds allows users to define circuitry to suit their value added and differentiated system architecture  rather than restrict their system 
table of contents architecture based upon the assp manufacturer s device specification 
furthermore  the emergence of ip design blocks in plds has allowed the implementation of standardized functions otherwise performed by assps 
we believe that the adoption of more advanced chip manufacturing technology  which is increasing the total cost of chip development  is reducing the cost advantage of asics and assps 
the cost and time for us to develop a pld is comparable to the cost and time for others to develop an asic or assp 
since each of our plds is sold to hundreds or thousands of customers  we generally spread development costs and generate revenue across a wide customer base 
in contrast  asic and assp suppliers build fixed  custom chips for a single customer or for a single application 
because it is increasingly difficult for asic and assp suppliers to identify opportunities that generate enough revenue to compensate for the high development costs  we believe that asic suppliers are imposing ever higher up front costs and minimum order quantities on customers  and assp manufacturers may be developing fewer products 
strategy and competition we believe that the increasing cost associated with the use of advanced chip manufacturing technology is driving the development and use of standard  programmable digital integrated circuits 
as with microprocessors and memory  plds provide the flexibility for the end user to change and define circuits without incurring the cost  risk and delays of custom chip fabrication 
consequently  we believe that customers will increasingly use plds for both prototyping and production rather than asics or assps  despite the higher per unit cost of plds 
in order to capture a larger percentage share of the semiconductors purchased by our customers  we are focused on providing the most advanced programmable solutions 
to accomplish this goal  we strive to offer our customers plds with the speed  density  functionality  and package types to meet their specific needs  plds optimized for low cost and high volume applications  hardcopy devices that enable our customers to easily move from our largest plds to a low cost structured asic implementation of their designs  optimized  pre verified system level ip cores to speed their design process  state of the art development tools that offer low cost  ease of use and compatibility with other industry standard electronic design automation  or eda  tools  and a complete customer support system 
we believe that the greatest opportunity for our growth is displacing asics and assps 
as a result  our strategy in recent years has not only been to add more prototyping customers  but more importantly  to use cost optimized products to increase our penetration into high volume customers and end markets 
we compete with other pld vendors to realize this opportunity and for market share within the pld market 
the programmable logic market is highly concentrated with two vendors accounting for a majority of the total market ourselves and xilinx  inc using publicly available data and information obtained from gartner dataquest  we estimate that the smaller vendors  including lattice semiconductor corporation and actel corporation  together comprise approximately of the pld market 
within the pld market  sales of fpgas and cplds constitute the majority of revenues 
cplds and fpgas are often viewed as two distinct sub segments of the pld market and  due to product differences  generally do not compete directly for the same customer designs 
altera was an early entrant in the cpld sub segment and  based on our estimates  we believe that in and we had a share in the cpld sub segment  in  and in the fpga sub segment has outgrown the cpld sub segment 
fpgas now comprise approximately of total pld sales  and it is generally accepted by participants and observers of the industry that the fpga sub segment will continue to be the fastest growing sub segment of the pld market 
based on our estimates  we believe that in we had a share in the fpga sub segment  up from in  in and in  and that maintaining or increasing market share in this sub segment is important to our long term growth 
competition among pld vendors is most intense in the design win phase of the customer s design 
the design win phase refers to the customer s selection of a particular vendor s product for use in the customer s electronic system 
because each vendor s product offering is proprietary  the cost to switch pld devices after a system has been designed and prototyped is very high 
therefore  customers rarely switch pld vendors after this initial selection for a particular 
table of contents design 
from the time a design win is secured it can be as long as two years  and sometimes longer  before the customer starts volume  or production  purchases of our devices 
typically  the customer selects the pld vendor relatively early in the customer s design program 
it generally takes several years from that point before the customer has completed its entire system design  built prototypes  sampled the marketplace for customer acceptance  made any modifications  and established volume manufacturing capacity 
thus  movements in pld market share often occur some time after the change in relative competitiveness that gave rise to the market share shift 
because of this time lag  market share is a lagging indicator of relative competitive strength 
because it is extremely difficult to forecast the degree of success or timing of a customer s program  and because the end markets are so fragmented we have over  pld customers  it is difficult even for pld vendors to gauge their competitive strength in securing design wins as of a particular point in time 
principal competitive factors in the pld sub segment include technical innovation  device performance and features  capability of software development tools and ip cores  pricing and availability  quality and reliability  technical service and customer support  manufacturing and operational competence  and customer familiarity with existing vendors and entrenched products 
we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors and that our proprietary device architecture and our installed base of software development systems may provide some competitive advantage 
we have been able to introduce new product families that  as compared to their predecessors  provide greater functionality at a lower price for any given density because of unique architectural innovation and advanced technologies 
we also believe that in certain circumstances these new product families compete favorably against asics and assps  as well as against other types of chips such as microcontrollers  microprocessors  and digital signal processors 
some of the functionality offered by these other types of chips can be implemented in plds using pre built and pre verified ip cores 
an ip core is typically offered in either a hard or soft form 
a hard ip core is embedded into the actual circuitry of our chips 
a soft ip core is a licensed design file that our customers incorporate into their design and program onto the pld 
by incorporating more functionality and logic capacity on a programmable chip while providing the necessary design tools and ip cores to design a reliable system  we believe we can enhance the advantages of plds over competing solutions 
as is true of the semiconductor industry as a whole  the digital logic segment and the pld sub segment are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change  rapid rates of product obsolescence  and price erosion 
all of these factors may adversely affect our future operating results 
for a discussion of risk factors associated with our strategy and competition  see item a risk factors our failure to compete successfully in the highly competitive semiconductor industry would adversely affect our financial results and business prospects and our failure to define  develop  and manufacture technologically advanced products would adversely affect the success and growth of our company 
products our products consist primarily of devices  ip cores  and proprietary development tools 
a brief overview of these products follows 
devices our devices fall into the following four categories fpgas  cplds  low cost hardcopy structured asic devices  and configuration devices that store the programming code for our fpgas 
these devices span multiple 
table of contents architectures and device families  with numerous product options 
each device family offers unique functional benefits and differing density and performance specifications 
sales of fpgas accounted for of our total sales in  in  and in sales of cplds accounted for of our total sales in  in  and in sales of our other products accounted for of our total sales in  in  and less than of our total sales in some of our latest device families  which are typically designed into new end equipment  are summarized and described below 
certain of our more mature device families  which are not now typically designed into new end equipment but may still comprise significant portions of our total revenue  have been omitted from the descriptions below 
stratix ii and stratix iii high end  system level fpgas our stratix product families are built using advanced cmos process technology and address a broad range of applications in communications  computing and storage  consumer  and industrial markets 
architectural innovations within stratix fpgas help provide high logic density and performance and low power consumption  while offering high speed and flexible embedded system functionality such as memory and digital signal processing dsp blocks 
additionally  our stratix ii gx fpga devices offer advanced transceiver capabilities for applications that require reliable  multi gigabit data transfer rates 
our stratix iii family is planned for initial shipment in and offers the lowest power consumption amongst high performance fpgas in the marketplace 
cyclone ii low cost  high volume fpgas our cyclone product families are built using advanced cmos process technology and bring programmable flexibility to cost sensitive applications across a vast array of end markets within the communications  computing and storage  consumer  and industrial markets 
architectural innovation allows cyclone devices to combine a low cost structure with abundant device resources  making them ideal for high volume applications across all our served markets in areas such as digital set top boxes  dvd player recorder systems  automotive telematics  and flat panel televisions 
max ii cplds our max cpld product families are instant on  non volatile devices that address a wide range of high speed glue logic functions found in a broad range of electronics equipment in the communications  computing and storage  consumer  and industrial markets 
glue logic enables the interaction of multiple subsystem components 
our current generation max ii devices are based on a newly developed and revolutionary architecture that reduces costs by up to percent or more  consumes percent less power  and increases performance by as much as percent over the previous generation max family 
hardcopy and hardcopy ii structured asic devices our hardcopy and hardcopy ii hardcopy products offer customers a migration path from the highest density fpga families to a low cost structured asic device for high volume production applications 
in contrast to traditional cell based asics  in which every mask layer is custom and unique to the customer s design  structured asics share a common set of base layers and the customer s design is implemented in the device by customizing only the last few mask layers 
for a given process technology  structured asic devices deliver nearly the performance of comparable asics  but with reduced development costs and shorter production lead times 
hardcopy device base arrays are developed from equivalent fpgas by removing the configuration circuitry  programmable routing  and programmability for logic and memory 
this scheme reduces the die size while maintaining compatibility with the fpga architecture  providing seamless migration of the customer design to a hardcopy device 
as a result  hardcopy devices extend the flexibility and time to market advantages of high density fpgas  which are used typically for prototyping  to high volume  more cost sensitive applications historically served by traditional cell based asics 
intellectual property cores ip cores are pre verified building blocks that implement standard system level functions that customers incorporate in their pld design by using our proprietary development software 
soft ip cores available for use in our devices consist 
table of contents of our nios and nios ii soft core embedded processors and our portfolio of megacore functions  which we license to our customers  and our altera megafunction partners program  or ampp sm  cores  which are pre verified by us and licensed to our customers by third parties 
the nios and nios ii embedded processors utilize a reduced instruction set computing  or risc  architecture and are a cost competitive and flexible alternative to discrete microcontroller solutions 
the nios embedded processors can be efficiently implemented in all of our newer fpga devices 
the nios ii soft core embedded processor provides up to a improvement in price performance when compared to the original nios embedded processor and competes favorably with many discrete microcontrollers 
with ip cores  system designers can focus more time and energy on improving and differentiating the unique aspects of their system design  rather than spending time designing common off the shelf functions 
ip cores are essential to providing our customers solutions that enable higher levels of integration and faster time to market 
today  we offer a broad range of soft ip cores for various system blocks for dsp algorithms  bus interfaces  memory controllers  telecommunications  data communications  microprocessors  and peripherals 
prior to licensing a soft ip core  customers may download an encrypted soft ip core from our web site and verify that it works in their own system design 
while licensing soft ip cores represents a small portion of our total revenues  we believe a broad product offering in this area is necessary to compete with asic and assp vendors as well as other pld vendors 
development tools our proprietary development tools  consisting primarily of the quartus ii software  enable our customers to successfully complete all necessary pld design steps 
our tools enhance engineering productivity by facilitating design entry  design compilation  design verification  and device programming during the initial design and subsequent design revisions 
our development tools can be used on a variety of computing platforms and have built in interfaces with other engineering design software  thus making it possible for customers to utilize their existing design environment 
our quartus ii software development tools run under the microsoft windows  unix including solaris and hp ux  and linux operating environments 
our development tools also provide interfaces to many industry standard eda tools  including those offered by cadence design systems  inc  mentor graphics corporation  synopsys  inc  and synplicity  inc like soft ip cores  our development tools generate less than of our total revenues  but are a critical and necessary element of our product portfolio because they are used to program our devices and can drive our success in competing for design wins against asic and assp vendors as well as other pld vendors 
research and development our research and development activities have focused primarily on plds and on associated ip cores  development software  and hardware 
we have developed these related products in parallel to provide comprehensive design support to customers 
as a result of our research and development efforts  we have introduced during the past three years a number of new families  including the stratix ii  stratix ii gx  cyclone ii  max ii  and hardcopy ii device families  as well as major enhancements to our ip core offerings and the quartus ii development platform 
our research and development expenditures were million in  million in  and million in research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred 
we intend to continue to spend substantial amounts on research and development in order to continue to develop and achieve market acceptance of our new products 
for a discussion of risk factors associated with our research and development efforts  see item a risk factors our failure to define  develop  and manufacture technologically advanced products would adversely affect the success and growth of our company 
patents  trademarks  and licenses we generally rely on intellectual property law  including patent  copyright  trademark  and trade secret laws  to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in products and technology 
we have increased investment in intellectual property protection in the last several years and  as of december   we owned more than  united states 
table of contents and foreign patents 
we also have more than patent applications currently pending 
also  we have used  registered  and applied to register certain trademarks and service marks to distinguish our products  technologies  and services from those of our competitors in the united states and foreign countries 
in addition  we file registrations in the united states under the semiconductor chip protection act to protect our chip designs 
we have entered into technology licensing agreements that give us rights to design  manufacture  and sell products using certain intellectual property owned by others 
in july  we entered into a settlement agreement with xilinx under which we settled all pending patent litigation 
as part of the settlement agreement  we entered into a royalty free patent cross license agreement with xilinx  including a prohibition of further patent litigation between the two companies through july in connection with the settlement agreement  we paid xilinx a one time payment of million 
similarly  in july  we entered into a settlement agreement with lattice under which we settled all pending patent litigation 
as part of the settlement agreement  we entered into a royalty free patent cross license agreement with lattice  including a multi year prohibition of further patent litigation between the two companies 
no payments were made by altera or lattice as part of the settlement 
when necessary  we seek to enforce our intellectual property rights 
for example  in  we brought an action against clear logic  inc for infringement of our mask work registration rights and for interfering with our license agreements with our customers 
a jury in the united states district court for the northern district of california decided in our favor on both issues in october  and the jury verdict was affirmed on appeal by the ninth circuit court of appeals in september although we believe that protection afforded by our intellectual property rights has value  the rapidly changing technology in the semiconductor industry makes our future success dependent primarily on the innovative skills  technological expertise  and management abilities of our employees rather than on our patent  trademark  or other proprietary rights 
for a discussion of risk factors associated with our patents  trademarks  and licenses  see item a risk factors the failure of our intellectual property rights to provide meaningful protection from our competitors could harm our competitive position and intellectual property infringement claims could adversely affect our ability to manufacture and market our products 
marketing and sales we market our products worldwide through a network of distributors  independent sales representatives  and direct sales personnel 
from time to time  we may add or remove independent sales representatives or distributors from our selling organization as we deem appropriate 
altera distributors we engage distributors in all major geographic markets that we serve 
these distributors are franchised by component manufacturers to sell a wide variety of products to many customers  and they may sell competing products or solutions 
we have contracts with our distributors  which can be terminated by either party in a relatively short period of time 
the main roles of our independent distributors are to provide demand creation for the broad base of customers and order fulfillment services for most of our customers 
all of our distributors stock inventory of our products 
the distributors purchase products from us at a set distributor cost denominated in us dollars 
title and risk of loss generally transfer upon shipment from our stocking locations  which are primarily located at the independent subcontractors we employ for test and assembly services in the asia pacific region or our warehouse in san jose 
upon shipment to the distributor  we generally defer revenue on the sale in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
consequently  the deferred revenue and the corresponding deferred cost of sales are recorded as a current liability under the caption titled deferred income and allowances on sales to distributors 
all payments to us are denominated in us dollars 
for a detailed discussion of our revenue recognition policy  see note significant accounting policies revenue recognition to our consolidated financial statements 
our sales cycle begins with a design win phase  which is generally lengthy and often requires the ongoing participation of sales  engineering  and managerial personnel 
once customer demand has been created and a design is ready to move into prototyping or production  the order fulfillment process begins 
regardless of whether altera  an independent sales representative  or the distributor created the demand  a local distributor will process and fulfill over of all orders from customers 
our distributors are the legal sellers of the products and therefore bear all risks  such as credit loss  inventory shrinkage and theft  and foreign currency fluctuations that are generally related to the sale of commercial goods 

table of contents in accordance with our distribution agreements and industry practice  we have granted our distributors the contractual right to return certain amounts of unsold product on a periodic basis and also to receive price concessions for unsold product in the case of a subsequent decrease in list prices 
we also provide price concessions to our distributors for a portion of their original purchase price in order for them to address individual negotiations involving high volume or competitive situations 
typically  a customer purchasing a small quantity of product for prototyping or development from a distributor will pay list price 
however  a customer using our products in volume production  purchasing thousands or even hundreds of thousands of units  will often competitively negotiate a substantial price discount from the distributor 
under such circumstances  the distributor will often negotiate and receive a price concession from altera 
in recent years  such concessions have exceeded of list price on average 
this is a standard practice in the semiconductor industry and we provide some level of price concession to every distributor 
total sales are the sum of our own direct sales to oems and our distributors resales of altera products 
for the fiscal year ended december   worldwide sales through distributors for subsequent resale to oems or their subcontract manufacturers accounted for of total sales 
arrow electronics  inc  or arrow  continues to be our largest distributor 
arrow on a worldwide basis accounted for of total sales in  in  and in our second largest distributor  altima corporation  accounted for of total sales in  in  and in no other distributor accounted for greater than of total sales in or in  a third distributor  paltek corporation  accounted for of total sales 
in march  we terminated our distribution relationship with paltek corporation 
for a discussion of the risk factors associated with our distribution model  see item a risk factors we rely heavily on distributors to generate a significant portion of our sales and fulfill our customer orders 
the failure of our distributors to perform as expected would materially reduce our future sales and conditions outside the control of our independent subcontractors and distributors may impact their business operations and thereby adversely interrupt our manufacturing and sales processes 
see also note significant accounting policies concentrations of credit risk to our consolidated financial statements 
altera sales  marketing  and customer support altera also maintains a dedicated global sales and marketing organization to create customer demand and manage our network of distributors and independent sales representatives 
in general  we focus our direct demand creation efforts on a limited number of key accounts  as well as providing technical  business  and marketing support to distributors and independent sales representatives 
independent sales representatives are mostly located in north america and in select european countries 
independent sales representatives create demand and provide customer support in a defined territory and  in many cases  with a defined set of customers 
they stock no inventory and provide no order fulfillment services 
all of our contracts with independent sales representatives may be terminated by either party in a relatively short period of time 
customer support and service are important aspects of selling and marketing our products 
we provide several levels of technical user support  including applications assistance  design services  and customer training 
also  we publish data sheets and application notes  conduct technical seminars  and provide design assistance via the internet and electronic links to the customer 
throughout the united states  we have domestic sales offices in numerous major metropolitan areas 
in addition  we maintain international sales support offices in various metropolitan areas including bangalore  beijing  cork  helsinki  hong kong  london  munich  osaka  ottawa  paris  seoul  shanghai  shenzhen  singapore  stockholm  taipei  tokyo  and turin 
no single end customer accounted for more than of our total sales in  or international sales international sales  which consist of all sales outside of north america  constituted of total sales in  of total sales in  and of total sales in sales to japan accounted for of total sales in  and of total sales in and except for the united states and japan  no other country accounted for sales in excess of of total sales during   or we expect international sales to continue to increase as a percentage of 
table of contents our total sales in the future 
all of our sales to foreign entities are denominated in united states dollars 
for a detailed description of our sales by geographic region  see item results of operations sales by geography and note segment and geographic information to our consolidated financial statements 
for a discussion of the risk factors associated with our foreign operations  see item a risk factors because we depend on international sales for a majority of our total sales  we may be subject to political  economic and other conditions that could increase our operating expenses and disrupt our business and our business is subject to tax risks associated with being a multinational corporation 
backlog our backlog consists mostly of distributor orders  as well as limited oem orders  that are for delivery within the next three months 
our backlog of orders on december   was approximately million  compared to million on december  historically  backlog has been a poor predictor of future customer demand 
while our backlog can increase during periods of high demand and supply constraints  purchasers may generally cancel product orders up to days prior to the scheduled delivery date without incurring significant cancellation penalties 
further  we generally defer recognition of revenue on shipments to distributors until the product is resold 
for all of these reasons  backlog as of any particular date should not be used as a predictor of future sales 
manufacturing wafer supply die  cut from silicon wafers  are the essential components of all our devices and a significant portion of the total device cost 
our manufacturing strategy is known as a fabless business model since we do not directly manufacture our silicon wafers 
instead  our silicon wafers are produced by independent semiconductor foundries 
this enables us to take advantage of these suppliers high volume economies of scale and also gives us direct and timely access to advanced process technology 
we purchase nearly all of our silicon wafers from taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  or tsmc  an independent semiconductor foundry 
we have no formalized long term supply or allocation commitments from tsmc 
the remaining portion of our silicon wafers are produced by sharp corporation in japan 
in the past  we have used other foundry vendors  and we may establish additional foundry relationships as they become economically beneficial or technically necessary 
for a discussion of risk factors associated with our wafer supply arrangements  see item a risk factors we depend entirely on independent subcontractors to supply us with finished silicon wafers 
the failure of these subcontractors to satisfy our demand could materially disrupt our business  shortages of  and or increased costs for  our silicon wafers could lower our gross margins  reduce our sales  or otherwise materially disrupt our business  the manufacture of our products is complex  and the foundries on which we depend may not achieve the necessary yields or product reliability that our business requires  and conditions outside the control of our independent subcontractors and distributors may impact their business operations and thereby adversely interrupt our manufacturing and sales processes 
testing and assembly after wafer manufacturing is completed  each silicon wafer is tested using a variety of test and handling equipment 
the vast majority of our silicon wafer testing is performed at tsmc or our san jose pilot line facility  which is used primarily for new product development 
this testing is performed on equipment owned by us and consigned to our partners 
the wafers are then shipped to various assembly suppliers in asia  where good die are separated into individual chips that are then encapsulated in packages 
we employ a number of independent suppliers for assembly purposes 
this enables us to take advantage of these subcontractors high volume economies of scale and supply flexibility  and gives us direct and timely access to advanced packaging technology 
we purchase almost all of our assembly services from amkor electronics  inc  in korea and the philippines  and advanced semiconductor engineering  inc  or ase  in malaysia and taiwan 

table of contents following assembly  each of the packaged units receives final testing  marking  and inspection prior to being packaged for storage as finished goods 
we obtain almost our entire final test and back end operation services from amkor and ase 
final testing by these assembly suppliers is accomplished through the use of our proprietary test software operating on hardware that is consigned to or owned by our suppliers 
the majority of our inventory  including finished goods  is warehoused at our subcontract test and assembly partners located in asia with a smaller portion located at our corporate facility in san jose  california 
on our behalf  these suppliers also ship our products to oems and distributors

risk factors 
the following risk factors  among others  could in the future affect our actual results of operations and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements made by us 
before you decide to buy  hold  or sell our common stock  you should carefully consider the risks described below  in addition to the other information contained elsewhere in this report 
the following risk factors are not the only risk factors facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business 
our business  financial condition  and results of operation could be seriously harmed if any of the events underlying any of these risks or uncertainties actually occurs 
in that event  the market price for our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
our failure to compete successfully in the highly competitive semiconductor industry would adversely affect our financial results and business prospects 
the semiconductor industry  including the pld market  is intensely competitive 
our ability to compete successfully in the semiconductor industry will depend on our ability to provide our customers with solutions offering greater value than solutions offered by competing programmable logic vendors  such as xilinx and lattice  and other semiconductor companies that indirectly compete with us 
because we develop plds for applications that are presently served by vendors of asics  assps  microcontrollers  and digital signal processors  we indirectly compete against vendors of these products 
many of these vendors  including international business machines corporation and texas instruments inc  have substantially greater financial  technical  and marketing resources than we do and have well established market positions and solutions that have proven technically feasible and economically competitive over several decades 
we may not be able to displace these vendors in the targeted applications and densities 
further  other programmable logic vendors are targeting these applications and may be successful in securing market share from us 
moreover  some of our customers have historically used standard cell technologies to achieve greater integration in their systems  this may not only impede our efforts to penetrate the markets for asics  assps  microcontrollers  and digital signal processors  but may also displace our products in the applications that we presently serve 
our failure to define  develop  and manufacture technologically advanced products would adversely affect the success and growth of our company 
as a semiconductor company  we operate in a dynamic market characterized by rapid technological change 
the manufacture of our products is a highly complex and precise process  requiring production in a tightly controlled environment 
our current product development efforts focus on developing new plds  related development software and hardware  and advanced semiconductor wafer fabrication processes 
our development efforts may not result in the timely introduction of competitive new products  or enhancements to existing products 
additionally  we may not be successful in developing new products or using and converting established products to new and more advanced process technologies 
for example  our current generation product families  the stratix ii and cyclone ii families  are manufactured on a nanometer all layer copper interconnect process 
our next generation product families will be manufactured on a nanometer all layer copper interconnect process for which we have no production history 
we will continue to transition our fabrication process arrangements to smaller circuit geometries 
the use of advanced process technology entails inherent technological risks and start up difficulties that can adversely affect research and development spending  yields  product costs  and timeliness of delivery of our products 
we depend entirely on independent subcontractors to supply us with finished silicon wafers 
the failure of these subcontractors to satisfy our demand could materially disrupt our business 
nearly all of our silicon wafers are produced by tsmc in its manufacturing facilities located primarily in taiwan 
the remaining portion of our silicon wafers are produced by sharp corporation in japan 
silicon wafer production facilities have at any given time a fixed capacity  the allocation of which is determined solely by our vendors and over which we have no direct control 
we have no formalized long term supply or allocation commitments from our foundry suppliers 
our operations would be disrupted if tsmc terminates its relationship with us and we are unable to arrange a satisfactory alternative to fulfill customer orders on a timely basis and in a cost effective manner 
to ensure the continued supply of wafers  we may establish other sources of wafer supply for our products as these arrangements become economically advantageous or technically necessary 
however  there are only a few foundry 
table of contents vendors that have the capabilities to manufacture our most advanced products 
if we engage alternative sources of supply  we may encounter start up difficulties and incur additional costs 
also  shipments could be delayed significantly while these sources are qualified for volume production 
furthermore  as a result of our reliance on third party foundries  we have little or no direct control over production costs  delivery schedules  and wafer quality 
we also face increased exposure to potential misappropriation of our intellectual property 
shortages of  and or increased costs for  our silicon wafers and assembly material could lower our gross margins  reduce our sales  or otherwise materially disrupt our business 
if market demand for silicon wafers or assembly material suddenly exceeds market supply  our supply of silicon wafers or assembly material could quickly become limited 
a shortage in manufacturing capacity could hinder our ability to meet demand for our products 
moreover  silicon wafers constitute more than half of our product cost 
if we are unable to procure wafers at favorable prices  our gross margins will be adversely affected 
the manufacture of our products is complex  and the foundries on which we depend may not achieve the necessary yields or product reliability that our business requires 
the manufacture of our products is a highly complex and precise process  requiring production in a tightly controlled environment 
in addition to sufficient foundry manufacturing capacity and wafer prices  we depend on good production yields the number of good die per wafer and timely delivery of silicon wafers to meet our customers demand for products and to maintain profit margins 
wafer production yields depend on a wide variety of factors including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment  impurities in the materials used  and the performance of personnel and equipment 
as is common in the semiconductor industry  we have experienced  and may experience  from time to time  problems with achieving acceptable production yields and timely delivery from our foundry vendors 
difficulties in production yields can often occur when we begin production of new products  when we transition to new processes  or when our principal wafer supplier  tsmc  moves production of a product from one manufacturing plant to another  or manufactures the same product at multiple factories 
as a result of manufacturing defects  tsmc has also  from time to time  scrapped wafers  resulting in longer manufacturing lead times 
further  production throughput times vary considerably among the various factories used by our wafer suppliers  and we may experience delays from time to time in processing some of our products 
these difficulties and delays can potentially result in significantly higher costs and lower product availability 
conditions outside the control of our independent subcontractors and distributors may impact their business operations and thereby adversely interrupt our manufacturing and sales processes 
the economic  market  social  and political situations in countries where certain independent subcontractors and distributors are located are unpredictable  can be volatile  and can have a significant impact on our business because we may not be able to obtain or distribute product in a timely manner 
market and political conditions  including currency fluctuation  terrorism  political strife  war  labor disruption  and other factors  including natural or man made disasters  adverse changes in tax laws  tariff  import or export quotas  power and water shortages  or interruption in air transportation  in areas where our independent subcontractors and distributors are located also could have a severe negative impact on our operating capabilities 
for example  because we rely heavily on tsmc to produce a significant portion of our silicon wafers  earthquakes or other natural disasters in taiwan and asia generally could limit our supply of silicon wafers and thereby harm our business  financial condition  and results of operation 
our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes and other catastrophic events 
our corporate headquarters in san jose  california is located near major earthquake faults 
some of our international facilities and those of our key suppliers  including tsmc  are also located near major earthquake faults 
any catastrophic event  such as an earthquake or other natural disaster  could significantly impair our ability and the ability of our independent subcontractors to meet product design deadlines  maintain our records  pay our suppliers  or manufacture or ship our products 

table of contents any prolonged disruption to our global communications infrastructure could impair our ability to plan factory activity and respond to customer demand 
demand for our products is highly volatile  especially at the detailed ordering code level 
to achieve short delivery lead times and superior levels of customer service  while maintaining low levels of inventory  we constantly adjust our manufacturing subcontractors production schedules 
we develop and adjust these schedules based on end customer demand as placed on our distributors and based on our inventory levels  manufacturing cycle times  component lead times  and projected production yields 
we aggregate and disseminate all of this information electronically over a complex global communications network 
our ability to aggregate demand and to adjust our production schedules is highly dependent on this network  we have no manual back up 
if a portion of this network were to experience a prolonged disruption or failure in service  our ability to plan factory activity and respond to demand would be impaired 
the failure of our intellectual property rights to provide meaningful protection from our competitors could harm our competitive position 
we rely significantly on patents to protect our intellectual property rights 
we have increased investment in intellectual property protection in the last several years and  as of december   we owned more than  united states patents and foreign patents 
we also have more than patent applications currently pending 
our patents and patent applications may not provide meaningful protection from our competitors as the status of any patent involves complex legal and factual questions  and the breadth of claims allowed is uncertain 
our competitors may be able to circumvent our patents or develop new patentable technologies that displace our existing products 
in addition to patent protection  we rely on trademark  trade secret  copyright  and mask work laws to protect our unpatented proprietary information or technologies 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use or disclosure  other parties  including our former employees or consultants  may attempt to disclose  obtain  or use our proprietary information or technologies without our authorization 
if other companies obtain our proprietary information or technologies  or develop substantially equivalent information or technologies  they may develop products that compete against our products 
moreover  the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
policing the unauthorized use of our products is difficult and may result in significant expense to us and could divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
even if we spend significant resources and efforts to protect our intellectual property  we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology 
use by others of our proprietary rights could materially harm our business and expensive litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights 
intellectual property infringement claims could adversely affect our ability to manufacture and market our products 
from time to time in the normal course of business  we receive inquiries from other parties with respect to possible patent infringements 
as a result of these inquiries  it may be necessary or desirable for us to obtain licenses relating to one or more of our current or future products 
we may not be able to obtain licenses on reasonable terms 
additionally  license agreements may have set durations and or have limited license grants and therefore may not provide complete protection against infringement claims involving all of our current or future products 
for example  the settlement agreement that we entered into with xilinx in july  which prohibited patent litigation between the two companies  expired in july if we are sued for patent infringement  the costs and outcome of litigation will be unpredictable and may have a negative impact on our financial results 
intellectual property claims  regardless of their merit  can result in costly litigation and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
legal proceedings also tend to be unpredictable and may be affected by events outside of our control 
if we are unsuccessful in defending against intellectual property infringement claims  we may be required to pay significant monetary damages or be subject to an injunction against the manufacture and sale of one or more of our product families 
alternatively  we could be required to expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  the success of which may be uncertain 
intellectual property litigation may have an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operation  or cash flows 

table of contents product quality problems could lead to reduced revenue  gross margins  and net income 
we produce highly complex products that incorporate leading edge technology  including both hardware and software 
our pre shipment testing programs may not detect all defects  either ones in individual products or ones that could affect numerous shipments 
because we generally warrant our products for varying lengths of time against defects in materials and workmanship and non conformance to our specifications  we have on occasion been required to repair or replace certain components or refund the purchase price paid by our customers due to product defects 
if there are material increases in customer claims or the costs to service warranty claims compared with our historical experience  our revenue  gross margins  and net income may be adversely affected 
for example  an inability to cure a product defect in a timely manner could result in product reengineering expenses  increased inventory costs  or damage to our reputation  any of which could materially impact our revenue  gross margins  and net income 
we may be subject to product liability claims 
we sell to customers in the automotive  military  aerospace  avionics  medical equipment  and other industries where our devices are used in systems that could cause damage to property or persons if those systems were to fail 
we may be subject to product liability claims if our devices are the cause of system failures 
based on our historical experience  we believe that the risk of exposure to product liability claims is currently low 
however  we will face increased exposure to product liability claims if there are substantial increases in both the volume of our sales into these applications and the frequency of system failures caused by our devices 
we rely heavily on distributors to generate a significant portion of our sales and fulfill our customer orders 
the failure of our distributors to perform as expected could materially reduce our future sales 
worldwide sales through distributors accounted for of our total sales during we rely on many distributors to assist us in creating customer demand  providing technical support and other value added services to our customers  filling customer orders  and stocking our products 
our contracts with our distributors may be terminated by either party in a relatively short period of time 
our distributors are located all over the world and are of various sizes and financial conditions 
lower sales  lower earnings  debt downgrades  the inability to access capital markets  and higher interest rates could potentially impact our distributors operations 
we are highly dependent on arrow electronics  inc  in many locations across the world  particularly in north america 
during  arrow electronics  inc on a worldwide basis accounted for approximately of total sales  while our next largest distributors accounted for approximately and of total sales  respectively 
at december   arrow accounted for of net accounts receivable  while our next largest distributors accounted for   and of net accounts receivable  respectively 
our complex communications infrastructure limits our ability to add or replace distributors or manufacturing subcontractors 
our distributors and manufacturing subcontractors must have a relatively high level of data processing and communications expertise to link to our global communications network 
even for distributors or manufacturing subcontractors with sophisticated data processing and communications capabilities  the process of integrating their system with our system over our network can take weeks or months 
thus  there is a long lead time to add new or replace existing distribution or manufacturing partners 
the length of our design in and sales cycle could impact our ability to forecast future sales 
our sales depend on our products being designed into our end customers products and those products achieving volume production 
our products are very complex in nature  and the time from design in to volume production ranges from months to years or more 
from initial product design in to volume production  many factors could impact the timing and or amount of sales actually realized 
these factors include  but are not limited to  changes in the competitive position of our technology  the competitiveness of our customers products in the markets they serve  our customers financial stability  customer program delays and cancellations  and our ability to ship products according to our customers schedule 

table of contents our business is characterized by a general decline in selling prices of semiconductor products that may materially adversely affect our profitability 
we have experienced and continue to experience a decrease in the selling prices of our products 
we have attempted to offset the decrease in selling prices through manufacturing cost reductions  improving our yields  and increasing unit sales 
however  there is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts will be successful or that they will keep pace with the anticipated  continued decline in selling prices of our products  which could ultimately lead to a decline in revenues and have a negative effect on our gross margins 
because we depend on international sales for a majority of our total sales  we may be subject to political  economic and other conditions that could increase our operating expenses and disrupt our business 
during each of the last three years  international sales were a majority of our total sales 
during  international sales constituted approximately of our total sales 
we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our total sales 
risks related to our foreign operations include unfavorable economic  market  political  and social conditions in a specific country or region  fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates  adverse changes in tax laws  increased freight costs  interruptions in air transportation  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  generally longer receivable collection periods  and natural or man made disasters in a specific country or region where we sell our products 
our business is also subject to the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and risks associated with the imposition of legislation and regulations relating specifically to the importation or exportation of semiconductor products 
quotas  duties  tariffs  taxes  or other charges  restrictions  or trade barriers may be imposed by the united states or other countries on the import or export of our products in the future 
our business is subject to tax risks associated with being a multinational corporation 
as a multinational corporation  we conduct our business in many countries and are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions 
the taxation of our business is subject to the application of multiple and sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations as well as multinational tax conventions 
the application of tax law is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment  and uncertainty  and tax laws themselves are subject to change 
consequently  taxing authorities may impose tax assessments or judgments against us that could result in a significant charge to earnings relating to prior periods and or an increase in our effective income tax rate 
our gross margins are subject to fluctuations due to many factors 
our gross margins may fluctuate depending on many factors  including  but not limited to  our product mix  market acceptance of our new products  competitive pricing dynamics  geographic and or market segment pricing strategies  changes in the mix of our business between prototyping and production based demand  and various manufacturing cost variables including product yields  wafer prices  package and assembly costs  provisions for excess and obsolete inventory  and absorption of manufacturing overhead 
additionally  since the majority of our business books and ships  on sales generated through our distributors within the same quarter  forecasting our gross margins is difficult 
our financial results are affected by general economic conditions and the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry 
semiconductor companies  such as altera  experience significant fluctuations in sales and profitability 
during  the semiconductor industry was significantly impacted by the economic downturn and contraction in the computing and communication equipment markets and by the ensuing inventory correction in the supply chain for those industries 
this down cycle  like many of the preceding down cycles  resulted in significant reductions in unit demand  excess customer inventories  price erosion  and excess production capacity 
we experienced five consecutive declines in quarterly sales beginning in the fourth quarter of and ending in the fourth quarter of the protracted deceleration resulted in a peak to trough decline in quarterly sales of nearly 
in addition to reductions in sales  our profitability decreases during downturns as we are unable to reduce our expenses at the same rate as our sales decline 
for example  at the height of the previous up cycle  in the third quarter of  our operating expenses were less than of net sales compared to in the first quarter of similarly  our gross margins tend to deteriorate and fluctuate during down cycles 
for example  in the third quarter of  our 
table of contents reported gross margin was over of net sales compared to of net sales in the first quarter of furthermore  the industry contraction during was prolonged and severe and resulted in an inventory charge of million in relating primarily to the write off of inventories in excess of projected demand 
additionally  as a result of reduced demand and in an effort to reduce our ongoing expense levels  we incurred restructuring charges and write downs totaling million in in the fiscal year ended december   our net income was million on net sales of billion whereas for the fiscal year ended december   we reported a net loss of million on net sales of million 
we expect that our future sales and profitability will continue to be volatile 
in an effort to reduce the possibility of future excess inventory  we reduced our inventory carrying targets in reductions in targeted inventory carrying levels may result in poorer delivery performance relative to our customers desired lead times 
poor delivery performance over time may erode our competitive position and result in a loss of market share 
despite our intent to operate with lower inventory levels  we are likely to experience inventory write downs in the future  especially if our inventory becomes out of mix with  or excess to  customer demand 
as we carry only limited insurance coverage s  any incurred liability resulting from uncovered claims could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
our insurance policies may not be adequate to fully offset losses resulting from covered incidents 
additionally  we do not have coverage for certain losses 
we have made certain judgments regarding our existing insurance coverage that we believe are consistent with common practice and economic and availability considerations 
if our insurance coverage is inadequate to protect us against unforeseen catastrophic losses  any uncovered losses could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
we depend on independent subcontractors  located in asia  to assemble  test  and ship our semiconductor products 
the failure of these subcontractors to satisfy our demand could materially disrupt our business 
because we rely on independent subcontractors to assemble  test  and ship our semiconductor products  we cannot directly control our product delivery schedules or quality levels 
we are dependent upon sufficient subcontractor assembly and test capacities  both in raw materials and services  to enable us to meet the demand for our own products 
our future success also depends on the financial viability of our independent subcontractors 
if market demand for subcontractor material and services exceeds available supply or if the subcontractors capital structures weaken  we may experience product shortages  quality assurance problems  and or increased manufacturing costs 
we have been named as a party to several lawsuits related to our historical stock option practices and related accounting and reporting  and we may be named in additional litigation in the future  all of which could result in an unfavorable outcome and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and the trading price for our securities 
lawsuits are currently pending against certain of our current and former directors and officers relating to our historical stock option practices and related accounting and reporting 
see part i  item legal proceedings and note legal proceedings for a more detailed description of these proceedings 
under certain circumstances  we have contractual and other legal obligations to indemnify and to incur legal expenses on behalf of current and former directors and officers in connection with these lawsuits 
we may become the subject of additional private or government actions regarding these matters in the future 
these actions are in the preliminary stages  and their ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business and the trading price for our securities 
litigation may be time consuming  expensive and disruptive to normal business operations  and the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict 
the defense of these lawsuits may result in significant expenditures and the continued diversion of our management s time and attention from the operation of our business  which could impede our business 
we are in the process of implementing a new enterprise resource planning erp system to manage our worldwide financial  accounting and operations reporting 
we have been preparing for the erp system implementation for over a year and are taking appropriate measures to ensure the successful and timely implementation including but not limited to hiring qualified consultants and performing extensive testing 
however  implementations of this scope have inherent risks that in the extreme could lead to a disruption in our financial  accounting and operations reporting as well as the inability to obtain access to key financial data

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us requires our management to make judgments and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our management believes that we consistently apply these judgments and estimates and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes fairly represent all periods presented 
however  any differences between these judgments and estimates and actual results could have a material impact on our consolidated statements of income and financial condition 
critical accounting estimates  as defined by the securities and exchange commission sec  are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our management s most difficult and subjective judgments and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting estimates include those regarding revenue recognition  valuation of inventories  income taxes  and stock based compensation 
revenue recognition we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  and to electronic components distributors who resell these products to oems  or their subcontract manufacturers 
we sell more than of our products to distributors for subsequent resale to oems or their subcontract manufacturers 
in almost all cases  sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing for returns and subsequent price adjustments  and we defer recognition of revenue until the products are resold by the distributor 
our revenue reporting is highly dependent on receiving pertinent and accurate data from our distributors in a timely fashion 
distributors provide us periodic data regarding the product  price  quantity  and end customer when products are resold as well as the quantities of our products they still have in stock 
because the data set is so large and because there are errors in the reported data  we must use estimates and apply judgments to reconcile distributors reported inventories to their activities 
any error in our judgment could lead to inaccurate reporting of our revenues  deferred income and allowances on sales to distributors  and net income 
valuation of inventories inventories are recorded at the lower of cost determined on a first in first out basis approximated by standard cost or market 
we establish provisions for inventory if it is in excess of projected customer demand  and the creation of such provisions results in a write down of inventory to net realizable value and a charge to cost of goods sold 
historically  it has been difficult to forecast customer demand especially at the part number level 
many of the orders we receive from our customers and distributors request delivery of product on relatively short notice and with lead times less than our manufacturing cycle time 
in order to provide competitive delivery times to our customers  we build and stock a certain amount of inventory in anticipation of customer demand that may not materialize 
moreover  as is common in the semiconductor industry  we allow customers to cancel orders with minimal advance notice 
thus  even product built to satisfy specific customer orders may not ultimately be required to fulfill customer demand 
we routinely compare our inventory against projected demand and record provisions for excess and obsolete inventories as necessary 
however  actual demand may materially differ from our projected demand  and this difference could have a material impact on our gross margin and inventory balances based on additional provisions for excess or obsolete inventory or a benefit from inventory previously written down 
income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax liabilities and the determination of net deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between tax and financial statement recognition methods 
we record valuation allowances  when necessary  to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that management estimates is more likely than not to be realized 
if in the future we determine that we are not likely to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded as a charge to earnings in the period such determination is made 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves the inherent uncertainty associated with the application of complex tax laws 
we are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
we believe we have adequately provided in our financial statements for additional taxes that we estimate may be required to be paid as a result of such examinations 
if the payment ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the tax liabilities would result in tax 
table of contents benefits being recognized in the period we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities  an additional charge to expense will result 
see provision for income taxes and note income taxes for further discussion 
effective december   the first day of our fiscal year  we will be required to adopt fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of sfas fin 
in july  the fasb issued fin  which prescribes a comprehensive model for recognizing  measuring  presenting and disclosing in the consolidated financial statements tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  including a decision whether to file or not to file in a particular jurisdiction 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  if there are changes in net assets as a result of application of fin  they will be accounted for as an adjustment to retained earnings 
we are currently assessing the impact of fin on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
based on our preliminary analysis  we expect a substantial portion of our income taxes payable balance of million as of december  to be reclassified in as a non current liability 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed 
adjustments for differences between our tax provisions and tax returns are recorded when identified  which is generally in the third or fourth quarter of our subsequent year 
stock based compensation on december   the first day of our fiscal year  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for share based payment awards 
we recognize compensation cost over the requisite service period of share based awards  usually the vesting period  based on the estimated fair value of the award 
share based payment awards for which we currently recognize stock based compensation expense include stock options  restricted stock units  and employee purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan espp shares 
the fair value of restricted stock units is based on the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant 
to determine the fair value of stock options and espp shares  we use the black scholes pricing model 
the fair value of stock options granted is estimated on the date of grant 
the fair value of espp shares is estimated on the first day of the offering period 
using the black scholes pricing model requires us to develop highly subjective assumptions including the expected term of awards  expected volatility of our stock  expected risk free interest rate  and expected dividend rate over the term of the award 
our expected term of awards assumption is based primarily on our historical experience with similar grants 
our expected stock price volatility assumption for both stock options and espp shares is estimated using a combination of implied volatility for publicly traded options on our stock with a term of one year or more and our historical stock price volatility 
the selection of a combination of implied and historical volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our stock and also upon our assessment that a combined volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility 
the risk free interest rate assumption approximates the risk free interest rate of a zero coupon treasury bond with a maturity approximately equal to the expected term of the stock option or espp shares 
in addition to the assumptions used in the black scholes pricing model  sfas r requires that we recognize expense for awards ultimately expected to vest  therefore we are required to develop an estimate of the number of awards expected to cancel prior to vesting forfeiture rate 
the forfeiture rate is estimated based on historical pre vest cancellation experience and is applied to all share based awards 
we monitor the assumptions used to compute the fair value of our share based awards and we will revise our assumptions as appropriate 
in the event that assumptions used to compute the fair value of our share based awards are later determined to be inaccurate or if we change our assumptions significantly in future periods  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted

executive overview company and market overview we are a global semiconductor company  serving over  customers in communications  computer and storage  industrial  and consumer market segments 
we design  manufacture  and market programmable logic devices  or plds  hardcopy structured application specific integrated circuit  or asic  devices  pre defined design building blocks known as intellectual property  or ip cores  and associated development tools 

table of contents plds are semiconductor integrated circuits that are built as standard chips that customers program to perform desired logic functions within their electronic systems 
our plds consist of field programmable gate arrays  or fpgas  and complex programmable logic devices  or cplds 
approximately of our revenue is generated from the sales of our plds 
the majority of the remainder of our revenue is derived from the sale of our hardcopy devices  which enable our customers to move from a high density fpga to a low cost  high volume non programmable implementation of their designs  and the licensing of ip cores and proprietary development tools 
our ip cores enable customers to easily implement standard functions in their pld designs  and our development tools are necessary to program our plds 
market opportunity we believe that the greatest opportunity for our growth is displacing asics and application specific standard products assps 
we estimate based on publicly available data  and with information derived from gartner dataquest  that the pld market was approximately billion in  whereas the digital logic market  consisting primarily of asics and assps  amounted to approximately billion 
because plds can be quickly programmed by the customer to perform the specific function the customer desires  we believe that plds provide greater advantages in flexibility  development cost  and time to market over asic and assp alternatives 
however  plds generally have a higher cost structure than these alternatives 
thus plds are particularly favored in applications where there is a substantial premium afforded to time to market and in end applications where unit volumes are low 
because of the relatively higher cost of plds  customers often use plds for their system development and prototyping and then use asic technology in volume production 
nevertheless  we believe that advances in pld technology and in semiconductor manufacturing technology in general are lowering the relative cost differential between plds and fixed chip alternatives  we have been and can continue to be increasingly successful in selling plds into applications and markets that have been traditionally served by asics and assps  and we can compete successfully for customer s volume production needs as well as their initial prototyping and development needs 
the pld market peaked at approximately billion in and declined over the next two years to approximately billion in from to  the pld market has grown each year  with a compound average growth rate of approximately 
due to the broad customer base for pld vendors  and the diverse market segments that they serve  future growth rates for the pld market are difficult to forecast and they may be lower than recent years 
pld market growth will be driven by the rate at which pld vendors can grow their customer base in both prototyping and production opportunities 
the two leading pld vendors serve an extremely large and diverse customer base and the opportunity to expand the number of customers may be limited 
as a result  a critical objective for pld vendors is not simply to add more prototyping customers  but rather to penetrate customers and end markets in high volume applications 
the pld vendors ability to access higher levels of production volume is contingent upon several factors including their ability to offer cost effective solutions versus asic and assp products 
publicly available data suggests that the number of asic design starts is in decline and the amount of pld logic consumed is growing rapidly 
at the same time  the price per effective unit of logic of plds has declined at a rate that partially offsets the increase in the amount of pld logic consumed 
in the future  as pld vendors seek penetration into high volume applications by offering lower cost devices  we expect the price per effective unit of logic to continue to decrease and partially offset revenue increases driven by higher pld logic consumption 
competing for design wins we compete with other pld vendors to displace fixed chip logic alternatives and for market share within the pld market 
the programmable logic market is highly concentrated with two vendors accounting for a majority of the total market ourselves and xilinx  inc competition between pld vendors is most intense in the design win phase of the customer s design 
a design win occurs when a customer selects a particular vendor product for use in the customer s electronic system 
because each pld vendor s product offering is proprietary  the cost to switch pld devices after a system has been designed and prototyped is very high 
therefore  a design win can provide the pld vendor with a profitable revenue stream through the life of the customer s program 
from the time a design win is secured  it can be as long as two years  and sometimes longer  before a customer starts the volume production of its system 
typically  a pld vendor for a particular application is selected relatively early in a customer s design program 
it may take several years from that point before the customer has completed its entire 
table of contents system design  built prototypes  sampled the marketplace for customer acceptance  made any modifications  and established volume manufacturing capacity 
thus  movements in pld market share often occur some time after the change in relative competitiveness that gave rise to the market share shift 
because of this time lag  market share is a lagging indicator of relative competitive strength 
because it is extremely difficult to forecast the degree of success and timing of customers programs  and because the end markets are so fragmented we have over  pld customers  it is difficult even for pld vendors to gauge their own competitive strength in securing design wins as of a particular point in time 
developing competitive products a pld vendor s ability to secure design wins and to maintain or increase market share is highly dependent on the cost and quality of the pld vendor s products  particularly the effectiveness and reliability of a pld vendor s proprietary development software 
all pld vendors provide proprietary development software at little or no cost to the customer 
the software  working in tandem with device logic architecture and features  creates the functionality desired by the customer 
as customers gain familiarity with a particular pld vendor s software  there is often an increasing likelihood that the customer will want to use that same software again in another design  giving that pld vendor a potential advantage as the next system is designed 
we develop our software in parallel with device development  and there are schedule and integration risks between the two processes 
if we fail to create adequate software to support our new devices as they are introduced  we weaken our competitive position  which can have long lasting effects if customers switch to competing solutions and become less familiar and less skilled in using our software 
we focus our research and development resources on new generation fpga devices because increasing market share in the fpga sub segment is important to our long term growth and profitability 
due to the higher integration density and lower cost per function  the fpga sub segment has outgrown the cpld sub segment in recent times  and it is generally accepted by participants and observers of the industry that this trend will continue 
in  we introduced two new fpgas the stratix high end and the cyclone low cost families 
in  we introduced a transceiver based stratix gx family 
in  we introduced the next generation high end fpga  the stratix ii family  and  in early  the new low cost cyclone ii family 
in  we announced the next generation stratix iii family  which is planned for shipment beginning in as a result of these product introductions  we estimate based on publicly available data  and with information derived from gartner dataquest  that our fpga market share versus our main competitor has increased from percent in to percent in our current overall pld market share is percent 
adding to our stratix fpgas is our hardcopy family of structured asics 
we first shipped hardcopy devices in  offering to our customers low cost  non programmable production devices that use our highest density fpgas as an integrated development vehicle 
the conversion from the fpga is virtually seamless and requires very little additional customer engineering 
this product is targeted specifically at those applications and customers that have used plds for prototyping and development and asics from other vendors for their volume production needs 
in  our hardcopy device revenues were less than percent of total revenues and we believe hardcopy may increase as a percentage of revenues over the long term 
the presence of a hardcopy conversion path for high density designs differentiates our fpga offering competitively 
since  we have introduced newer versions of the hardcopy family to support newer generations of fpgas 
our approach is unique in the industry and may under perform our expectations 
there are other structured asic competitors who are larger in size than we are and who have established reputations as asic suppliers  currently we provide customers with an automated conversion from an fpga to a structured asic 
as we develop new generations of fpgas  we may create parallel hardcopy devices  which entails ongoing engineering effort and expense 
in  we improved our cpld offering with the introduction of the max ii family 
the max ii family offers price and features that we believe are competitively attractive  with economics  performance  and density that are superior to our previous offerings 
since the unit price of these devices is low compared to our other new products  we will need to ship substantial unit quantities to increase market share in the cpld market 
an fpga family typically reaches peak sales to years after product introduction 
as a result  the original stratix and cyclone families we introduced in  which comprised approximately percent of total sales in  may be at or near peak sales 
the products we introduced from to have yet to reach peak sales  but will eventually experience sales declines 
for us to improve or even sustain our rate of growth  we must successfully introduce successor generations of devices 
to the degree other pld vendors have improved or will improve the competitiveness 
table of contents and execution of their products  our ability to improve our rate of growth may be impaired 
within the next several quarters  we plan to ship newer families of fpga devices using more advanced production techniques that will further improve product performance and lower cost 
our foundry partner  taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc  will manufacture these die using production processes that are new to the industry 
given the extreme complexity of semiconductor fabrication  tsmc may encounter difficulties that could delay our product launch or limit supply so that we would be unable to meet customer commitments 
we may discover manufacturing errors after we begin shipping  which would harm customer relations and cause us to incur additional unforeseen costs 
simultaneous introduction of new pld architectures and ramp of new technology processes are inherently risky 
diagnosing failures  identifying root causes  and implementing corrective actions in a production wafer fabrication facility are expensive and time consuming processes 
we may not successfully commercialize our new products  or our new products may not enable us to maintain or increase market share 
some of our competitive offerings will be offered later than the competition and it is possible that our competitive offerings will be less effective  thus weakening our market share 
it is also possible that our primary competitor may have secured design wins that  when they enter production  will reverse some of our current market share success 
our main competitor is larger in size with more sales resources  and we may not enjoy the same success that we saw with previous fpga generations 
customer intimacy and cost optimized product strategy in general  we rely on interaction with our customers to gain product development insights  and we make development decisions years before a product begins to ship 
we have been able to gain market share on the strength of our product definition methodology and the successful rollout of new products 
however  because our products are complex  we assume considerable risk with every new product introduction 
if we misinterpret customer requirements or changes in demand  our products may become uncompetitive 
our competitors are knowledgeable and skilled and  in some cases  larger than we are 
since it is difficult to gauge competitive success until the design win phase is well underway  it may be too late to make any changes to a generation of products if those products are uncompetitive 
if a generation of our products is uncompetitive and we lose market share  regaining customers subsequently is very challenging 
since and following the semiconductor industry correction  our strategy to displace asics and assps has emphasized the development of cost optimized products 
these products have contributed to growth across all of our market segments and are increasingly being used by our customers in production volumes  not just as prototyping or low volume solutions 
production volumes vary by industry  but customers buying our products for use in production volumes expect lower unit pricing 
consequently  our business today is subject to a wider range of gross margins than the range of gross margins associated with a less diverse  largely prototyping business 
depending on the mix of high and low volume business  our gross margins can vary more quarter to quarter than in the past 
since the majority of our business books and ships in the same quarter  forecasting our gross margins has also become more difficult 
while we believe that growth will occur across all of our market segments  our gross margins could move upward or downward if our growth pattern favors a low volume or high volume market segment

contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual cash obligations at december   and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flows in future periods payments due by period dollars in millions total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations capital lease obligations  including interest wafer purchase obligations other non current liabilities total contractual cash obligations we lease facilities under non cancelable lease agreements expiring at various times through rental expense under all operating leases amounted to million in  million in  and million in we depend entirely upon subcontractors to manufacture our silicon wafers 
due to lengthy subcontractor lead times  we must order materials from these subcontractors well in advance  and we are obligated to pay for the materials once they are completed 
we expect to receive and pay for these materials in we sponsor a retiree medical plan providing medical benefits to eligible retirees and their spouses 
benefits are available to employees hired on or before july  who retire from altera at or after age if they have at least years of service 
effective january   future participation is also limited to existing employees who were age or older as of january  in addition to these leases and purchase obligations  in the normal course of business  we enter into a variety of agreements and financial commitments 
it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement 
historically  payments pursuant to such agreements have not been material 
we believe that any future payments required pursuant to such agreements would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations 
impact of currency translation and inflation we purchase the majority of our materials and services in us dollars and sell our products to oems and distributors in us dollars 
as of december   we had no open forward contracts  however  we may enter into contracts from time to time to hedge foreign exchange exposure 
we have  in the past  entered into forward contracts to hedge against currency fluctuations associated with contractual commitments denominated in foreign currencies 
common stock repurchases since the inception of our stock repurchase program in through december   our board of directors has authorized million shares for repurchase and we have repurchased a total of million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of billion 
all shares were retired upon acquisition 
on december   million shares remained authorized for repurchases under our stock repurchase program 

table of contents common stock repurchase activities for   and were as follows in millions  except per share amounts shares repurchased cost of shares repurchased average price per share we temporarily suspended our stock repurchase program from may to october  which was necessitated by our failure to timely file our periodic reports as a result of the restatement of our consolidated financial statements 
during  we entered into agreements pursuant to sec rule b under which we authorized a third party broker to purchase shares on our behalf during our normal blackout period according to predetermined trading instructions 
in addition  we have repurchased shares of our common stock under the guidelines of sec rule b off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any financial partnerships with unconsolidated entities  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of sfas fin 
fin prescribes a comprehensive model for recognizing  measuring  presenting and disclosing in the financial statements tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  including a decision whether to file or not to file in a particular jurisdiction 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  if there are changes in net assets as a result of application of fin these will be accounted for as an adjustment to retained earnings 
we are currently assessing the impact of fin on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
based on our preliminary analysis  we expect a substantial portion of our income taxes payable balance of million as of december  to be reclassified in as a non current liability 
on september   the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  sab  which provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
the guidance is applicable for our fiscal year the adoption of sab did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas 
sfas requires an employer to recognize the over funded or under funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan other than a multiemployer plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income of a business entity or changes in unrestricted net assets of a not for profit organization 
the provisions of sfas require an employer with publicly traded equity securities to recognize the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan and to provide the required disclosures as of the end of the fiscal year ending after december  the adoption of sfas did not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations and the incremental effect on our consolidated balance sheet as at december  is summarized in note employee benefits plans 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the changes to current practice resulting from the application of sfas relate to the definition of fair value  the methods used to measure fair value  and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not believe that the adoption of the provisions of sfas will materially impact our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk investment and interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types and maturity dates totaling billion as of december  the market value of these investments on any given day during the investment term may vary as a result of market interest rate fluctuations 
a hypothetical movement in interest rates during the investment term would not likely have a material impact on the fair value of the portfolio 
the actual impact on the fair value of the portfolio in the future may differ materially from this analysis  depending on actual balances and changes in the timing and the amount of interest rate movements 
our net income is dependent on  among other factors  interest income and realized gains from the sale of marketable securities 
if interest rates decline or we are unable to realize gains from the sale of marketable securities  our net income may be negatively impacted 
foreign currency risk although we purchase the majority of our materials and services in us dollars and sell our products to oems and distributors in us dollars  we do have international operations and are  therefore  subject to foreign currency rate exposure 
to date  our exposure to exchange rate volatility has been insignificant 
if foreign currency rates were to fluctuate by from rates at december   our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows would not be materially affected 
however  we cannot guarantee that there will not be a material impact in the future
