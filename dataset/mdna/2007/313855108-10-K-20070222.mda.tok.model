table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
allowances for doubtful accounts the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers 
the company s policy is to establish  on a quarterly basis  allowances for doubtful accounts based on factors such as historical loss trends  credit quality of the present portfolio  collateral value and general economic conditions 
if the historical loss trend increased or decreased in  the company s operating income would have decreased or increased by million  respectively 
though management considers the valuation of the allowances proper and adequate  changes in the economy and or deterioration of the financial condition of the company s customers could affect the reserve balances required 
inventory reserve the company performs ongoing evaluations to ensure that reserves for excess and obsolete inventory are properly identified and recorded 
the reserve balance includes both specific and general reserves 
specific reserves at are established based on the identification of separately identifiable obsolete products and materials 
general reserves for materials are established based upon formulas which are established by reference to  among other things  the level of current inventory relative to recent usage  estimated scrap value and the level of estimated future usage 
historically  this reserve policy has given a close approximation of the company s experience with excess and obsolete inventory 
the company does not foresee a need to revise its reserve policy in the future 
however  from time to time unusual buying patterns or shifts in demand may cause large movements in the reserve balance 
warranty reserve the company s products generally carry express warranties that provide repairs at no cost to the customer or the issuance of credit 
the length of the warranty term depends on the product sold  but generally extends from six months to five years based on the terms that are generally accepted in the company s marketplaces 
certain components necessary to manufacture the company s vehicles including chassis  engines and transmissions are covered under an original manufacturers warranty 
such manufacturers warranties are extended directly to end customers 
the company accrues its estimated exposure to warranty claims at the time of sale based upon historical warranty claim costs as a percentage of sales 
management reviews these estimates on a quarterly basis and adjusts the warranty provisions as actual experience differs from historical estimates 
infrequently  a material warranty issue can arise which is outside the norm of the company s historical experience  costs related to such issues  if any  are provided for when they become probable and estimable 
the company s warranty cost as a percentage of net sales totaled in  in and in the decrease in the rate in is primarily due to operational improvements in the fire rescue business 
management believes the reserve recorded at december  is appropriate 
a increase or decrease in the estimated warranty costs in would have decreased or increased operating income by million  respectively 
workers compensation and product liability reserves due to the nature of the products manufactured  the company is subject to product liability claims in the ordinary course of business 
the company is partially self funded for workers compensation and product liability 
table of contents claims with various retention and excess coverage thresholds 
when a claim is filed  an initial liability is estimated  if any is expected  to settle the claim 
this liability is periodically updated as more claim facts become known 
the establishment and update of liabilities for unpaid claims  including claims incurred but not reported  is based on the assessment by the company s claim administrator of each claim  an independent actuarial valuation of the nature and severity of total claims and management s estimate 
the company utilizes a third party claims administrator to pay claims  track and evaluate actual claims experience and ensure consistency in the data used in the actuarial valuation 
management believes that the reserve established at december  appropriately reflects the company s risk exposure 
the company has not established a reserve for potential losses resulting from hearing loss litigation see note  if the company is not successful in its defense  it will record a charge for such claims  to the extent they exceed insurance recoveries  at the time a judgment or settlement is made 
goodwill impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company ceased amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets effective january  sfas no 
also requires the company to test these assets annually for impairment  the company performs this test in the fourth quarter unless impairment indicators arise earlier 
the company continues to amortize definite lived intangible assets over their useful life 
a review for impairment requires judgment in estimated cash flows based upon estimates of future sales  operating income  working capital improvements and capital expenditures 
management utilizes a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of the company s reporting units 
if the sum of the expected discounted cash flows of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is required against the unit s goodwill 
the annual testing conducted in and did not result in any impairment 
although management believes that the assumptions and estimates used were reasonable  a sensitivity analysis for each reporting unit is performed along with the impairment test 
the analysis indicated that a change in the operating margin assumption would not have resulted in a goodwill impairment in any group 
financial market risk management the company is subject to market risk associated with changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
to mitigate this risk  the company utilizes interest rate swaps and foreign currency options and forward contracts 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and is not party to leveraged derivatives contracts 
interest rate risk the company manages its exposure to interest rate movements by targeting a proportionate relationship between fixed rate debt to total debt generally within established percentages of between and 
the company uses funded fixed rate borrowings as well as interest rate swap agreements to balance its overall fixed floating interest rate mix 
of the company s debt at december   was used to support financial services assets  the weighted average remaining life of those assets is typically under three years and the debt is substantially match funded to the financing assets

foreign exchange rate risk the company has foreign currency exposures related to buying and selling in currencies other than the local currency in which it operates 
the company utilizes foreign currency options and forward contracts to manage these risks 
the following table summarizes the company s foreign currency derivative instruments as of december  all are expected to settle in in millions expected settlement date average notional contract fair amount rate value forward contracts buy euros  sell us dollars other currencies total forward contracts options buy us dollars  sell euros total foreign currency derivatives see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of these agreements

 foreign currency translation 
for derivatives designated as natural hedges  changes in fair values are reported in the other income expense line of the consolidated statements of operations 
other matters the company has a business conduct policy applicable to all employees and regularly monitors compliance with that policy
