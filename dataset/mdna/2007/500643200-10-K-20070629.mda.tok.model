in fiscal  we earned an operating profit of million with operating income from executive recruitment of million and million from futurestep  offset by corporate expenses of million 
this represents an increase of over the prior fiscal year s operating income of million 
we had no long term debt or outstanding balance under our credit facility at april  our working capital increased million to million at april  critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements 
preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions 
in preparing our financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances  we apply our accounting policies as disclosed in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
we consider the policies discussed below as critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition 
management is required to establish policies and procedures to ensure that revenue is recorded over the performance period for valid engagements and related costs are matched against such revenue 
we provide recruitment services on a retained basis and generally bill clients in three monthly installments 
since the fees are generally not contingent upon placement of a candidate  our assumptions primarily relate to establishing the period over which such service is performed 
these assumptions determine the timing of revenue recognition and profitability for the reported period 
if these assumptions do not accurately reflect the period over which revenue is earned  revenue and profit could differ 
any services that are provided on a contingent basis are recognized once the contingency is fulfilled 
deferred compensation 
estimating deferred compensation requires assumptions regarding the timing and probability of payments of benefits to participants and the discount rate 
changes in these assumptions would significantly impact the liability and related cost on our balance sheet and statement of operations 
management engages an independent actuary to periodically review these assumptions in order to ensure that they reflect the population and economics of our deferred compensation plans in all material respects and to assist us in estimating our deferred compensation liability and the related cost 
the actuarial assumptions we use may differ from actual results due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population 
these differences could have a significant impact on our deferred compensation liability and the related cost 
carrying values 
valuations are required under us generally accepted accounting principles to determine the carrying value of various assets 
our most significant assets for which management is required to prepare valuations are goodwill  intangible assets and deferred income taxes 
management must identify whether 
table of contents events have occurred that may impact the carrying value of these assets and make assumptions regarding future events  such as profitability 
differences between the assumptions used to prepare these valuations and actual results could materially impact the carrying amount of these assets and our operating results

 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
among other things  fin creates a model to address uncertainty in tax positions and clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold which all income tax positions must achieve to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
in addition  fin requires expanded annual disclosures  including a tabular rollforward of the beginning and ending aggregate unrecognized tax benefits as well as specific detail related to tax uncertainties for which it is reasonably possible the amount of unrecognized tax benefit will significantly increase or decrease within months 
fin is effective for the company on may  any differences between the amounts recognized in the statement of financial position prior to the adoption of fin and the amounts reported after adoption are generally accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance of retained earnings

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of our global operating activities  we are exposed to certain market risks  including foreign currency exchange fluctuations and fluctuations in interest 
we manage our exposure to these risks in the normal course of our business as described below 
we have not utilized financial instruments for trading  hedging or other speculative purposes nor do we trade in derivative financial instruments 
foreign currency risk 
substantially all our foreign subsidiaries operations are measured in their local currencies 
assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at the rates of exchange in effect at the end of each reporting period and revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange during the reporting period 
resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of comprehensive income on our consolidated statement of stockholders equity 
transactions denominated in a currency other than the reporting entity s functional currency may give rise to transaction gains and losses that impact our results of operations 
historically  we have not realized significant foreign currency gains or losses on such transactions 
in the year ended april   we recognized foreign currency gains  after income taxes  of million primarily related to our emea operations 
our primary exposure to exchange losses is based on outstanding intercompany loan balances denominated in us dollars 
if the us dollar strengthened  and against the pound sterling  the euro  the canadian dollar  the australian dollar and the yen  the company s exchange loss would have been million  million and million  respectively  based on outstanding balances at april  if the us dollar weakened by the same increments against pounds sterling  the euro  the canadian dollar  the australian dollar and the yen  the company s exchange gain would have been million  million and million  respectively  based on outstanding balances at april  interest rate risk 
we primarily manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through our regular financing activities  which generally are short term and provide for variable market rates 
as of april   we had no outstanding balance on our credit facility 
we have million of borrowings against the cash surrender value 
table of contents of coli contracts as of april  bearing interest primarily at variable rates 
the risk of fluctuations in these variable rates is minimized by the fact that we receive a corresponding adjustment to our borrowed funds crediting rate on the cash surrender value on our coli contracts
