executive summary description of business alliant energy is an investor owned public utility holding company  whose primary subsidiaries are ipl  wpl  resources and corporate services 
ipl is a public utility engaged principally in the generation  transmission  distribution and sale of electric energy  and the purchase  distribution  transportation and sale of natural gas in selective markets in iowa and minnesota 
wpl is a public utility engaged principally in the generation  distribution and sale of electric energy  and the purchase  distribution  transportation and sale of natural gas in selective markets in wisconsin 
resources is the parent company for alliant energy s non regulated businesses 
corporate services provides administrative services to alliant energy and its subsidiaries 
alliant energy manages three primary businesses as defined below utility business ipl and wpl  non regulated businesses resources and subsidiaries  and alliant energy parent and other 
utility business ipl and wpl own a portfolio of electric generating facilities with a diversified fuel mix including coal  natural gas and renewable resources 
the output from these generating facilities  supplemented with purchased power  is used to provide electric service to approximately million electric customers in the upper midwest 
the utility business also procures natural gas from various suppliers to provide service to approximately  retail gas customers in the upper midwest 
alliant energy s utility business is its primary source of earnings and cash flows 
the earnings and cash flows from the utility business are sensitive to various external factors including  but not limited to  the impact of weather on electric and gas sales volumes  the amount and timing of rate relief approved by regulatory authorities and other factors listed in forward looking statements 
non regulated businesses resources manages a relatively small portfolio of businesses through two distinct platforms non regulated generation manages electric generating facilities and other non regulated investments includes investments in environmental engineering and site remediation  transportation  construction management services for wind farms and several other modest investments  as well as a resort development in mexico that alliant energy is divesting 
alliant energy parent and other includes the operations of alliant energy the parent holding company as well as corporate services 
summary of historical results of operations alliant energy s earnings per average common share eps were as follows income from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations net income loss additional details regarding alliant energy s net income loss were as follows in millions continuing operations utility non regulated resources alliant energy parent and other taxes  interest and administrative and general income from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations net income loss vs 
summary increased earnings from alliant energy s utility business in were primarily due to lower nuclear related operating expenses resulting from the sales of its interests in its two nuclear facilities  the duane arnold energy center daec and the kewaunee nuclear power plant kewaunee  in january and july  respectively  an under recovery of retail fuel related costs at wpl in  impacts of an updated depreciation study implemented at ipl on jan 
 and higher weather normalized retail electric and gas sales 
these increases were substantially offset by higher nuclear related capacity costs from purchased power agreements entered into with the new owners of daec and kewaunee upon the sales of these facilities  higher incentive compensation related expenses and the net impacts of weather and weather hedging activities on alliant energy s electric margins 
the improved results from continuing operations for alliant energy s non regulated businesses were largely due to after tax  asset valuation charges of million per share recorded in related to alliant energy s brazil investments  which alliant energy sold in the first quarter of  and an after tax gain on the sale of alliant energy new zealand ltd 
aenz stock of million per share in these increases were partially offset by increased after tax charges related to further debt reductions at resources of million per share in compared to million per share in the increased earnings were also partially offset by after tax foreign currency transaction losses of million per share incurred in associated with alliant energy s new zealand investments  million per share of income realized in related to adjustments of deferred income tax valuation allowances resulting from changes in alliant energy s anticipated ability to utilize capital losses prior to their expiration  a million after tax loss per share from the sale of steam turbine equipment in and tax adjustments recorded in vs 
summary higher earnings from alliant energy s utility business in compared to were largely due to higher electric margins and per share of earnings from the impact of issues resolved in a federal income tax audit 
these items were partially offset by higher generation related  depreciation and regulatory related costs 
earnings from continuing operations at alliant energy s non regulated businesses were lower in compared to largely due to the asset valuation charges recorded in related to alliant energy s brazil investments and charges recorded in related to further debt reductions at resources 
these items were partially offset by improved operating results from alliant energy s international and other businesses and the reversal of deferred income tax asset valuation allowances in resulting from a change in alliant energy s anticipated ability to utilize capital losses prior to their expiration 
the non regulated results included an after tax gain of million per share realized from the sale of alliant energy s remaining interest in whiting petroleum corporation wpc and after tax charges of million per share related to early debt reductions at resources 
refer to alliant energy results of operations  ipl results of operations and wpl results of operations for additional details regarding the various factors impacting their respective earnings during  and strategic overview summary alliant energy is committed to maintaining sustained  long term strong financial performance with a strong balance sheet and credit ratings 
this strong financial performance will help ensure access to capital markets at reasonable costs as alliant energy embarks on a substantial infrastructure investment program described in utility generation plan below 
alliant energy believes it is well positioned to implement its strategic plan following the divestiture of numerous non regulated and utility businesses discussed in business divestitures below 
alliant energy s utility business is expected to provide the majority of alliant energy s earnings and cash flows in the future and the larger share of its long term earnings growth through investments in new utility generation  by earning returns authorized by regulators and by continuing its focus on controlling costs 
alliant energy is utilizing a comprehensive lean six sigma program to assist it in generating cost savings and operational efficiencies in both its utility and non regulated businesses 
utilities as primary business platform alliant energy s utility business is the growth platform within its strategic plan  and is where alliant energy expects to invest substantially all of its capital in and refer to liquidity and capital resources cash flows from used for continuing investing activities construction and acquisition expenditures for additional information regarding capital expenditure forecasts 
the strategic plan for alliant energy s utility operations is concentrated on building and maintaining the generation and infrastructure necessary to provide alliant energy s utility customers with safe  reliable and environmentally sound energy service  earning returns authorized by its regulators  controlling costs to mitigate potential rate increases  and completing the proposed sale of ipl s electric transmission assets discussed in utility business divestitures below 
alliant energy believes legislation passed in iowa and wisconsin provides utility companies in those states with the necessary rate making principles and resulting increased regulatory and investment certainty prior to making certain generation investments 
these changes have enabled alliant energy to pursue additional generation investments in its utility business to serve its customers and to provide shareowners with greater certainty regarding the returns on these investments 
refer to rates and regulatory matters for additional information regarding the progressive legislation 
focused approach to non regulated operations the strategic plan for alliant energy s non regulated operations involves maintaining a relatively small portfolio of lower risk  mature businesses  which are accretive to earnings but not significant users of capital 
consistent with this strategic focus  alliant energy completed the divestiture of numerous non regulated businesses in the past four years and expects to complete the divestiture of its remaining international investment in mexico in refer to non regulated business divestitures below for details of non regulated asset divestiture activity in and to date in utility generation plan alliant energy s current utility generation plan for the to time period reflects the need to increase base load generation in both iowa and wisconsin 
the proposed new generation is expected to meet increasing customer demand  reduce reliance on purchased power agreements and mitigate the impacts of potential future plant retirements 
alliant energy will continue to purchase energy and capacity in the market and intends to remain a net purchaser of both  but at a reduced level assuming the successful completion of these generation projects 
the plan also reflects continued commitments to alliant energy s energy efficiency and environmental protection programs 
alliant energy continues to monitor developments related to state and federal renewable portfolio standards  environmental requirements for new generation and federal and state tax incentives 
alliant energy reviews and updates  as deemed necessary and in accordance with regulatory requirements  its utility generation plan and expects to adjust its plan as needed to meet any of these standards or to react to any market factors increasing or decreasing the availability or cost effectiveness of the various renewable energy technologies and other alternatives to its utility generation plan

in september  wpl filed for approval from the public service commission of wisconsin pscw to construct the wind farm and to specify in advance fixed financial parameters and rate making principles 
in its regulatory application  wpl requested a return on common equity of along with a capital structure which includes a common equity ratio 
wpl expects a decision from the pscw in the first half of the expected commercial operation date is subject to the timing of pending regulatory approval and availability of wind turbines 
depending on the final model and size of wind turbines selected  wpl estimates the cost of the project will be between million and million 
b alliant energy currently estimates the cost of these wind projects to be approximately million per mw in current year dollars  excluding allowance for funds used during construction afudc 
wpl expects this additional wind generation will allow it to meet the initial phase of renewable energy standards in wisconsin which were enacted in march ipl expects this additional wind generation  along with an additional to mw of renewable energy not yet planned  will be needed to meet the initial phase of renewable energy standards in minnesota which were enacted in february refer to rates and regulatory matters for additional information regarding new laws in wisconsin and minnesota regarding renewable energy standards

in its regulatory application  wpl requested a return on common equity of along with a capital structure which includes a common equity ratio 
wpl expects a decision from the pscw in the first half of the current cost estimate for the new facility is million in current year dollars and excludes afudc  if applicable 
in addition  wpl anticipates expenditures of approximately million primarily for the expansion of existing barge transportation facilities and the addition of rail transportation facilities that will also be utilized by the existing units 
these cost estimates are also in current year dollars and exclude afudc  if applicable 
refer to liquidity and capital resources for discussion of future environmental cost estimates for nelson dewey and other generating facilities 
d the preferred site of the new facility is adjacent to the sutherland generating station in marshalltown  iowa 
ipl currently plans to own at least mw of a proposed mw facility and make the remaining capacity available to other utility partners 
the facility is anticipated to cost ipl and its partners approximately billion  in current year dollars 
this estimate excludes expenditures for utility interconnections  certain project development costs and afudc 
ipl expects to file for approval from the iowa utilities board iub to proceed with construction of the new facility and to specify in advance fixed financial parameters and rate making principles in mid and anticipates a decision from the iub in alliant energy currently has ppas with calpine subsidiaries related to the purchase of energy and capacity from the mw rockgen energy center rockgen  in christiana  wisconsin and the mw alliant energy leases mw of this total capacity under its current ppa riverside energy center riverside in beloit  wisconsin and has the option to purchase these two facilities in and  respectively 
for contingency planning purposes  alliant energy has requested proposals for wpl s summer peaking power supply needs for the years through if rockgen becomes unavailable as a result of the calpine bankruptcy proceeding 
in addition  alliant energy has also requested longer term proposals for either a ppa or the purchase of a facility to meet the peaking power supply needs of ipl and wpl beginning in alliant energy is pursuing responses from interested parties 
refer to note of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements and other matters other future considerations calpine bankruptcy for additional information 
business divestitures alliant energy completed the divestiture of numerous non regulated and utility businesses during the last four years in order to strengthen its financial profile and narrow its strategic and risk profile 
proceeds from these divestitures have been and will be used primarily for debt reduction  common share repurchases  funding capital expenditures and general corporate purposes 
the following includes various divestitures completed in and and certain planned divestitures for non regulated business divestitures in february  alliant energy announced it entered into a definitive agreement to sell its investment in mexico to an undisclosed buyer 
the purchase price is subject to certain adjustments at closing 
pending satisfaction of the closing conditions  the transaction is expected to be completed at the end of the first quarter of at dec

as of dec 
  none of these divested utility businesses have been reported as discontinued operations 
rates and regulatory matters overview alliant energy has two utility subsidiaries  ipl and wpl 
alliant energy s utility subsidiaries are currently subject to federal regulation by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc  which has jurisdiction over wholesale electric rates  electric transmission and certain natural gas facilities  and state regulation in iowa  wisconsin and minnesota for retail utility rates and standards of service 
such regulatory oversight also covers ipl s and wpl s plans for construction and financing of new generation facilities and related activities 
recent utility rate cases details of alliant energy s rate cases impacting its historical and future results of operations are as follows dollars in millions  electric e  gas g  water w  to be determined tbd  not applicable n a  fuel related f r  fourth quarter q expected return interim interim final final final on utility filing increase increase effective increase effective effective common case type date requested granted a date granted a date date equity notes wpl wholesale e tbd tbd n a b retail e g n a n a n a c retail f r e q n a n a d retail f r e n a n a retail e g n a n a n a wholesale e n a n a e retail f r e n a n a retail e g w n a n a wholesale e n a n a ipl mn retail e n a f ia retail g n a ia retail e n a i mn retail e n a i emery generating station emery and other a interim rate relief is implemented  subject to refund  pending determination of final rates 
the final rate relief granted replaces the amount of interim rate relief granted 
b in december  wpl received an order from ferc authorizing a million interim increase effective in june related to wpl s request to implement a formula rate structure for its wholesale electric customers 
the proposed rate structure uses formulas based on historical data for capacity costs and non fuel operations and maintenance costs  which adjust annually  and for variable fuel costs  which adjust monthly with a fuel adjustment clause  to determine applicable wholesale rates 
final rates approved by ferc may result from a settlement process or fully litigated process 
c the final increase granted was lower than the increase requested largely due to a decrease in forecasted fuel and purchased energy costs for the test period 
in addition  the pscw approved a regulatory capital structure with equity compared to requested  a return on common equity of compared to requested and lengthened certain regulatory asset amortization periods 
the regulatory capital structure approved by the pscw was determined by adjusting wpl s financial capital structure by approximately million compared to million requested of imputed debt largely from the kewaunee and riverside ppas 
the lower imputed debt adjustment was primarily the result of the pscw denying wpl s request to include the sheboygan falls energy facility sfef lease in the regulatory capital structure calculation 
lastly  the pscw adjusted wpl s afudc recovery rate for future retail jurisdiction construction projects from to 
d in september  the pscw approved a settlement agreement submitted by wpl and interveners that established final fuel related rates at a level reflective of actual fuel costs incurred from july  through june  the approval also allowed previously deferred  incremental purchased power energy costs associated with coal conservation efforts at wpl due to coal delivery disruptions to be included in the actual fuel costs and resolved all issues in the rate case regarding risk management activities and forecasting methodologies 
wpl refunded million to customers in october related to amounts collected in excess of final rates through june as part of the settlement  wpl also agreed to refund any over collection of fuel costs in the second half of which wpl has estimated at million 
wpl fully reserved estimated refunds to customers at dec 
 e in april  ferc issued the final written order approving the million annual rate increase included in wpl s settlement agreement with its wholesale customers 
final rates were applied to all service rendered on and after jan 
 amounts collected in excess of the final rates were refunded to customers  with interest  in june f amounts collected in excess of the final rates were refunded to customers  with interest  in july with the exception of recovering a return on emery  which was a large component of ipl s retail iowa electric rate case  and on other additions to ipl s and wpl s infrastructure  a significant portion of the rate increases included in the above table reflect the recovery of increased costs incurred or expected to be incurred by ipl and wpl 
thus  these increases in revenues are not expected to result in a significant increase in net income 
rate making principles for new electric generating facilities iowa and wisconsin each have laws hf in iowa and act in wisconsin that allow a public utility that proposes to purchase or construct an electric generating facility in its respective state to apply to its state regulatory commission for an order that specifies in advance the rate making principles that the state regulatory commission will apply to the electric generating facility costs in future rate making proceedings 
these laws are designed to give utilities in these states more regulatory certainty  including providing utilities with a fixed rate of return and recovery period for these investments  when financing electric generation projects 
ipl and wpl plan to utilize the rate making principles included in hf and act  respectively  for the electric generation facilities included in alliant energy s utility generation plan 
refer to strategic overview utility generation plan for additional details of alliant energy s utility generation plan including discussion of wpl s recent filings requesting approval to construct its wind generating facility in fond du lac county  wisconsin and coal fired generating facility in cassville  wisconsin 
new electric generating facilities require large outlays of capital and long periods of time to construct resulting in significant financing costs 
financing costs incurred by utilities during construction are generally included as part of the construction work in process cwip cost of the new generating facility through accruals of afudc 
rate making principles in iowa provide ipl the ability to recover these financing costs after the asset is placed in service 
in recent base rate cases  the pscw has authorized wpl to recover of these financing costs during construction by including that portion of the construction costs in net investment rate base and to recover the other of these financing costs after the asset is placed in service 
in its retail rate case  wpl requested the pscw to authorize that of cwip costs related to new electric generating facilities be included in net investment rate base allowing recovery of these costs during construction of these facilities as opposed to after they are placed in service 
in january  the pscw denied wpl s request because the new electric generating facilities had not yet received the required pscw approval 
wpl will continue to seek recovery of financing costs by inclusion of of cwip costs in net investment rate base in future rate proceedings 
lastly  new electric generating facilities require material expenditures for planning and siting these facilities prior to receiving approval from regulatory commissions to begin construction 
these expenditures are commonly referred to as pre certification costs and pre construction costs 
wpl has received approval from the pscw to defer pre certification costs and pre construction costs related to its wind generating facility in fond du lac county  wisconsin and coal fired generating facility in cassville  wisconsin 
utility fuel cost recovery ipl s retail electric and gas tariffs and wpl s wholesale electric tariffs provide for subsequent adjustments to its rates for changes in commodity costs thereby eliminating price risk for prudently incurred commodity costs 
wpl s retail gas tariffs provide for subsequent adjustments to its natural gas rates for changes in the current monthly natural gas commodity price index 
also  wpl currently has a gas performance incentive which includes a sharing mechanism whereby starting in january  of all gains and losses relative to current commodity prices  as well as other benchmarks  are retained by wpl  with refunded to or recovered from customers 
such rate mechanisms  significantly reduce commodity price risk associated with ipl s retail electric and retail gas margins and wpl s wholesale electric and retail gas margins 
wpl s retail electric margins  however  are more exposed to the impact of changes in commodity prices due largely to the current retail recovery mechanisms in place in wisconsin for fuel related costs as discussed below 
wpl s retail electric fuel related cost recovery wpl s retail electric rates are based on forecasts of forward looking test year periods and include estimates of future monthly fuel related costs includes fuel and purchased energy costs anticipated during the test year 
during each electric retail rate proceeding  the pscw sets fuel monitoring ranges based on the forecasted fuel related costs used to determine rates in such proceeding 
if wpl s actual fuel related costs fall outside these fuel monitoring ranges  the pscw can authorize an adjustment to future retail electric rates 
the fuel monitoring ranges set by the pscw include three different ranges based on monthly costs  annual costs and cumulative costs during the test period 
in order for wpl to be authorized to file for a proceeding to change rates related to fuel related costs during the test period  wpl must demonstrate first that any actual monthly costs during the test period exceeded the monthly ranges or the actual cumulative costs to date during the test period exceeded the cumulative ranges 
in addition  the annual projected costs that include cumulative actual costs for the test period must also exceed the annual ranges 
any affected party  including wpl or the pscw  may initiate a proceeding to change rates due to changes in fuel related costs during the monitoring period based on the above criteria 
in january  the pscw approved an order changing wpl s fuel cost monitoring ranges to plus or minus for the monthly range  plus or minus for the annual range  and for the cumulative range  plus or minus for the first month  plus or minus for the second month  and plus or minus for the remaining months of the monitoring period 
the pscw attempts to authorize  after a required hearing  interim fuel related rate increases within days of notice to customers 
any such change in rates would be effective prospectively and would require a refund with interest at the overall authorized return on common equity if final rates are determined to be lower than interim rates approved 
rate decreases due to decreases in fuel related costs can be implemented without a hearing 
the rules also include a process whereby wisconsin utilities can seek deferral treatment of emergency changes in fuel related costs between fuel related or base rate cases 
such deferrals would be subject to review  approval and recovery in future fuel related or base rate cases 
potential changes to wpl s fuel cost recovery mechanisms in february  wpl and certain other investor owned utilities jointly filed with the pscw proposed changes to the current retail electric fuel related cost recovery rules in wisconsin 
the proposal recommends each utility annually file a forecast of total fuel related costs and sales for the upcoming month period  which will be used to determine fuel related rates for such period 
any under or over collection of actual fuel related costs  in excess of plus or minus  for a utility during such month period would be reflected in an escrow account  with interest for that utility 
the balance of the escrow account at the end of each year would be included in the forecast of total fuel related costs for the following month period allowing recovery of under collected costs or refund of over collected costs in each subsequent year 
the proposal also provides the pscw an opportunity to review the actual fuel related costs for each month period to ensure the fuel related costs were prudent 
the definition of fuel related costs would also be expanded to specifically include miso energy market costs and revenues  emission allowance and trading costs and revenues  renewable resource credit costs and revenues and other variable operation and maintenance costs 
this proposal and other alternatives remain under discussion with the pscw and other interested parties  including wpl 
in january  the pscw directed wpl to work with the pscw staff over the following three months to help the pscw determine if it may be necessary to reevaluate the current benchmarks for wpl s gas cost recovery mechanism or explore a modified one for one pass through of gas costs to retail customers 
wpl is currently unable to predict the final outcome of these initiatives 
recent regulatory related legislative developments in february  a new law sf governing renewable energy was enacted in minnesota 
sf commits certain utilities operating in minnesota  including ipl  to a renewable energy standard res based on retail electric sales from renewable energy sources as a percentage of total retail electric sales in minnesota 
ipl must meet an res of by  by  by  and by utilities in minnesota may meet the requirements of the res with renewable energy generated by the utility  renewable energy acquired under ppas or the use of renewable resource credits 
refer to strategic overview utility generation plan for discussion of alliant energy s utility generation plan which includes additional supply from wind generation that will contribute towards ipl meeting this new res in minnesota and wpl meeting the new rps in wisconsin discussed below 
in december  legislation was enacted that extended certain tax provisions contained in the energy policy act of including extension of the renewable energy production tax credit for generating facilities placed into service prior to jan 
 in august  the pension protection act of was enacted 
this legislation includes changes to the minimum funding level requirements for postretirement benefit plans beginning in alliant energy does not expect this legislation will have a significant impact on its financial condition or results of operations based on the current funded status of its postretirement benefits plans 
in march  a new law act governing renewable energy and energy efficiency was enacted in wisconsin 
act commits wisconsin utilities to a renewable portfolio standard rps using a benchmark of average retail sales of renewable electricity in  and which was approximately to for wpl 
wpl must increase renewable retail electric sales as a percentage of total retail electric sales by two percentage points above this benchmark by  and by six percentage points above this benchmark by wisconsin utilities may meet the renewable energy requirements of the rps with renewable energy generated by the utility  renewable energy acquired under ppas or the use of renewable resource credits 
in addition  the new law requires wisconsin utilities to allocate of annual operating revenues to a statewide energy efficiency and renewable resource fund to be jointly administered by public utilities beginning in wpl s contributions to the energy efficiency and renewable resource fund will be recovered from ratepayers and therefore is not expected to impact its financial condition or results of operations 
in october  the american jobs creation act of was enacted which allows taxpayers to elect to recognize gains on the sales of qualifying electric transmission assets  which close before jan 
  over an eight year period for tax purposes beginning in the year the sale closes 
in august  the energy policy act of was enacted which extends this provision to qualifying electric transmission assets  which close before jan 
 alliant energy currently expects to elect this provision for any gain realized from the proposed sale of ipl s electric transmission assets 
refer to note of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the proposed sale 
other recent regulatory developments kewaunee outage in january  the pscw approved recovery of previously deferred costs associated with the extension of the unplanned outage at kewaunee prior to the sale by wpl of its interest in kewaunee in july the pscw approval included recovery of million of these deferred costs through increased retail electric rates charged by wpl over a two year recovery period 
kewaunee sale in january  the pscw approved recovery of a portion of the previously deferred loss associated with the sale of kewaunee 
the pscw approval included recovery of million of these deferred costs through increased retail rates charged by wpl over a two year recovery period 
coal delivery disruption in september  the pscw approved recovery of previously deferred costs associated with coal conservation efforts at wpl due to coal delivery disruptions 
the coal delivery disruptions were caused by railroad train derailments in wyoming in that caused heavy damage to heavily used joint railroad lines that supply coal to numerous generating facilities in the united states of america us  including facilities owned by wpl 
the pscw approved recovery of million million deferred in and million deferred in of these deferred costs by including them as a component of the fuel related costs used to determine final rates in wpl s fuel related rate case 
miso wholesale energy market in march  the pscw approved the deferral of certain incremental costs incurred by wpl to participate in the miso wholesale energy market 
in june  the pscw provided further clarification of which incremental costs incurred by wpl to participate in the miso market are eligible to be deferred 
such deferred amounts are the subject of a generic docket currently before the pscw 
hearings were held in early february and wpl anticipates an order in the third quarter of in may  the iub issued an order extending a temporary waiver until june  this waiver allows the costs and credits incurred by ipl to participate in the miso market that relate to its iowa retail customers to be included in ipl s iowa energy adjustment clause 
ipl and wpl are currently working through the regulatory process to establish long term recovery mechanisms for these costs 
kewaunee decommissioning trust assets in april  wpl received approval from the ferc to refund the wholesale portion of the kewaunee related non qualified decommissioning trust assets to wpl s wholesale customers

summary electric margins decreased million  or  in primarily due to million of higher purchased power capacity costs related to the daec and kewaunee ppas and the net impacts of weather conditions and alliant energy s weather hedging activities 
these decreases were partially offset by approximately million of under recoveries of retail fuel and purchased power energy costs at wpl in  a increase in weather normalized retail sales in and million of higher energy conservation revenues at ipl 
changes in energy conservation revenues are largely offset by changes in energy conservation expenses

summary electric margins increased million  or  in primarily due to the impact of various rate increases implemented in and  the net impacts of weather conditions and alliant energy s weather hedging activities  a increase in weather normalized retail sales and million of higher energy conservation revenues at ipl 
these items were partially offset by the impacts of higher purchased power capacity costs at wpl and a higher under recovery of fuel and purchased power energy costs in compared to at wpl 
purchased power capacity costs alliant energy sold its interests in its two nuclear facilities  daec and kewaunee  in january and july  respectively 
prior to the sale of these facilities  the operating expenses related to the facilities consisted primarily of other operation and maintenance and depreciation and amortization expenses 
upon the sale of the facilities  alliant energy entered into ppas with the new owners of the facilities and its share of the costs associated with these facilities is now recorded as purchased power expense 
as a result  there are large nuclear related variances between periods for these income statement line items  which are somewhat offsetting in nature and also do not capture other benefits from the sales including  among others  the impact of the application of the sales proceeds 
purchased power capacity costs included in electric production fuel and purchased power expense in the above table related to the daec and kewaunee ppas as well as the riverside ppa which began in june were as follows in millions daec ppa ipl kewaunee ppa wpl riverside ppa wpl refer to note of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the riverside ppa 
fuel and purchased power energy fuel related cost recoveries alliant energy s fuel related costs increased in and compared to prior years primarily due to increased commodity prices 
the increase in commodity prices relative to historic averages was largely due to natural gas disruption caused by hurricane activity in the gulf of mexico in the third quarter of due to ipl s rate recovery mechanisms for fuel related costs  these increases in fuel related costs resulted in a comparable increase in electric revenues and therefore did not have a significant impact on ipl s electric margins 
however  wpl s electric margins are subject to volatility with changes in fuel related costs due largely to the current retail recovery mechanisms in place in wisconsin for fuel related costs 
as a result of its retail rate recovery mechanism in wisconsin  wpl estimates it under recovered approximately million and million of retail fuel related costs in and  respectively 
wpl s under recovery of retail fuel related costs in was not significant 
the under recovery of retail fuel related costs in was largely due to the impact of incremental purchased power energy costs resulting from an unplanned outage at kewaunee in and the impact of coal supply constraints from the power river basin in refer to other matters market risk sensitive instruments and positions commodity price risk for discussion of risks associated with increased fuel and purchased power costs on wpl s electric margins 
refer to rates and regulatory matters utility fuel cost recovery for proposed changes to the retail rate recovery mechanisms in place in wisconsin for fuel related costs 
impacts of weather conditions estimated increases decreases to alliant energy s electric margins from the net impacts of weather and alliant energy s weather hedging activities were as follows in millions weather impacts on demand compared to normal weather losses from weather derivatives a net weather impact a recorded in other revenues in the above table 
alliant energy s electric sales demand is seasonal to some extent with the annual peak normally occurring in the summer months due to air conditioning usage by its residential and commercial customers 
cooling degree days cdd data is used to measure the variability of temperatures during summer months and is correlated with electric sales demand 
cdd in alliant energy s service territories were as follows actual cdd a normal a cedar rapids  iowa ipl madison  wisconsin wpl a cdd are calculated using a degree base 
normal degree days are calculated for cedar rapids using a fixed year average and for madison using a rolling year average 
in  alliant energy began utilizing weather derivatives based on cdd in chicago to reduce the potential volatility on its electric margins during the summer months of june through august 
the weather derivatives utilized for june  through aug 
 were effective in reducing volatility on its electric margins 
however  the weather derivatives utilized for june  through aug 
 did not produce the results expected by alliant energy 
while cdd have historically been highly correlated between chicago and alliant energy s service territories  this was not the case in as cdd were above normal in chicago during june through aug 
 compared to above normal and below normal in madison and cedar rapids  respectively 
alliant energy estimates this lack of correlation resulted in it incurring losses from the weather derivatives that exceeded by million the positive impact on its demand from the warmer than normal weather conditions during june  through aug 
 in addition  alliant energy estimates the impact on demand compared to normal weather during september  and such periods were not covered by weather derivatives was million million at ipl and million at wpl  million million at ipl and million at wpl and  respectively 
wholesale sales wholesale sales volumes were higher in compared to and largely due to the impacts of weather conditions on wholesale sales demand at wpl 
in addition  wholesale revenues were higher in compared to and due to the impacts of higher fuel related cost recovery revenues from wholesale customers at wpl in the changes in revenues caused by changes in fuel related costs were largely offset by changes in electric production fuel and purchased power expense and therefore did not have a significant impact on electric margins 
bulk power and other sales bulk power and other revenues were higher in compared to and largely due to higher sales in the restructured wholesale energy market operated by miso  which began on april  these changes in revenues were largely offset by changes in electric production fuel and purchased power expense and therefore did not have a significant impact on electric margins

these increases were partially offset by a decrease in weather normalized retail sales due largely to the negative impact high gas prices in the fourth quarter of had on gas sales during that period 
natural gas cost recoveries alliant energy s cost of gas sold increased in and compared to prior years primarily due to increased natural gas prices 
the increase in prices relative to historic averages was largely due to natural gas disruption caused by hurricane activity in the gulf of mexico in the third quarter of due to alliant energy s rate recovery mechanisms for natural gas costs  these increases in cost of gas sold resulted in a comparable increase in gas revenues and therefore did not have a significant impact on gas margins 
impacts of weather conditions estimated decreases to alliant energy s gas margins from the net impacts of weather and alliant energy s weather hedging activities were as follows in millions weather impacts on retail demand compared to normal weather gains losses from weather derivatives a net weather impact a recorded in transportation other revenues in the above table 
alliant energy s gas sales demand follows a seasonal pattern with an annual base load of gas and a large heating peak occurring during the winter season

utility operating cash flows are expected to substantially cover the utilities maintenance capital expenditures and dividends paid to alliant energy s shareowners 
capital requirements needed to retire debt and fund capital expenditures associated with utility rate base growth  including new generating facilities  are expected to be financed primarily through external financings and proceeds from asset divestitures  supplemented by internally generated funds 
in order to maintain its planned debt to total capitalization ratios  alliant energy and its subsidiaries may periodically issue additional debt and equity to fund such capital requirements

however  alliant energy and its subsidiaries are parties to various agreements  including ppas  fuel contracts and corporate guarantees that are dependent on maintaining investment grade credit ratings 
in the event of a downgrade below these credit rating levels  alliant energy or its subsidiaries may need to provide credit support  such as letters of credit or cash collateral equal to the amount of the exposure  or may need to unwind the contract or pay the underlying obligation 
ipl is also a party to an accounts receivable sales agreement that provides that a downgrade below investment grade level associated with its secured debt makes it ineligible to sell receivables under the program 
in the event of a downgrade below investment grade level  management believes alliant energy  ipl and wpl have sufficient liquidity to cover counterparty credit support or collateral requirements under the various agreements with rating triggers

environmental overview alliant energy s pollution abatement programs are subject to continuing review and are periodically revised due to changes in environmental regulations  construction plans and escalation of construction costs 
alliant energy continually evaluates the impact of potential future  federal  state and local environmental rulemakings on its operations 
while the final outcome of these rule makings cannot be predicted  alliant energy believes that required capital investments and or modifications resulting from them could be significant  but expects that prudent expenditures incurred by ipl and wpl likely would be recovered in rates from its customers 
given the dynamic nature of the utility environmental and other related regulatory requirements  ipl and wpl have an integrated planning process that includes the determination of new generation  environmental compliance requirements and other operational needs 
as part of ipl s and wpl s planning process  investments for environmental requirements are approved by alliant energy s board of directors 
the following are major environmental issues that could potentially have a significant impact on alliant energy s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
refer to cash flows from used for continuing investing activities construction and acquisition expenditures for information on ipl s and wpl s anticipated and environmental capital expenditures 
air quality the clean air act amendments mandate preservation of air quality through existing regulations and periodic reviews to ensure adequacy of these provisions based on scientific data 
in  the us environmental protection agency epa finalized the clean air interstate rule cair  which requires emission control upgrades to existing electric generating units with greater than mw capacity 
this rule will cap emission of sulfur dioxide so and nitrogen oxides nox in states including iowa  wisconsin and minnesota in the eastern u 
s and  when fully implemented  reduce so and nox emissions in these states by over and from levels  respectively 
the specific reductions for ipl  wpl and resources will be determined by state specific implementation plans  which could be more or less stringent than the noted and reductions 
the first phase of compliance for so and nox is required by and  respectively  and the second phase of compliance for both so and nox is required by this federal rule allows that additional reduction requirements may also be imposed at the state level for those areas that are in non attainment with national ambient air quality standards naaqs 
wpl has existing electric generating units located in non attainment areas for the hour ozone standard and may be subject to additional nox emission reductions 
in  the epa also finalized the clean air mercury rule camr which requires mercury emission control upgrades for coal fired generating units with greater than mw capacity 
when fully implemented  this rule will reduce us utility including ipl and wpl mercury emissions by approximately in a two phased reduction approach 
the first phase of compliance is required by and the second phase by the final cair and camr rules were both effective in and  by september and november  respectively  each state was to have submitted enforceable plans to the epa for approval  which complied with the requirements of these rules 
a federal implementation plan went into effect for those states that failed to file the state implementation plans by the respective due date 
the federal implementation plan adopted the epa s model cap and trade program for meeting the state emission budgets under cair and camr 
the epa views the federal implementation plan as a temporary measure that remains effective until that state s implementation plan is submitted and approved 
iowa is the only state with jurisdiction impacting ipl s and wpl s operations that filed its state implementation plans for epa review and approval by the filing deadlines 
wisconsin continues planning for these rules and intends to file its state implementation plans with the epa in the first quarter of minnesota currently plans to follow the federal implementation plan approach for meeting its state cair and camr compliance  however may file state implementation plans in the future 
alliant energy continues to participate in the development of the state implementation plans that impact ipl s and wpl s operations 
ipl s and wpl s specific compliance plans will not be completed until states with jurisdictions impacting each of ipl and wpl have received approval from the epa for their respective state implementation plans 
with the publication of the cair and camr rules in  alliant energy completed a preliminary evaluation of these rulemakings based on the epa s model cap and trade program to meet the required state emission reductions in a flexible and cost effective manner 
the resulting compliance plan for ipl and wpl includes investments in emission controls for their generating units as well as purchases of emission allowances 
ipl s and wpl s estimated capital expenditures from their initial plans for through associated with the first phase of compliance for cair and camr are million to million for ipl and million to million for wpl 
cost estimates for resources generating facilities will be assessed upon clarification with regulatory agencies of rule applicability to non regulated generation units 
alliant energy expects additional capital investments for the second phase compliance with cair and camr to be significant and material 
based on alliant energy s initial plan  estimates for capital expenditures for through required for phase two compliance with these rules are million to million for ipl and million to million for wpl 
these estimates are based on industry average costs of technologies and expected outcomes of state implementation plans for these rules 
in  additional information became available on state compliance requirements  however all state implementation plans that impact ipl and wpl are not final 
alliant energy is currently developing an updated compliance plan with revised cost estimates for emission control options for the affected generating units and continues to explore the potential use of the developing emission allowance markets as an option for compliance 
alliant energy plans to finalize an updated compliance plan after state implementation plans are approved by the epa in in  the epa s final industrial boiler maximum achievable control technology mact rule became effective and compliance with these new emission requirements for hazardous air pollutants is required by september this rule applies to fossil fueled generating units with less than mw capacity 
in  alliant energy submitted initial notifications to the epa and iowa department of natural resources dnr identifying specific fossil fueled generating units less than mw that potentially may require compliance with the industrial boiler mact rule 
in december  the epa issued a final rule clarifying the industrial boiler mact rule excludes any electric utility steam generating units that are subject to camr requirements 
alliant energy has since received concurrence from the iowa dnr that only two fossil fueled generating units are subject to the industrial boiler mact rule 
alliant energy expects that compliance with the industrial boiler mact rules for the two ipl fossil fueled generating units can be met with existing emission control equipment  periodic fuel monitoring and good combustion operational practices 
in addition  alliant energy is aware that certain citizen groups have begun pursuing claims against owners of utility generating stations regarding excess emissions  including opacity emissions 
while ipl and wpl have not received any such claims to date  wpl is aware that certain public comments have been submitted to the wisconsin dnr regarding excess emission reports for two of wpl s generating facilities 
wpl is unable to predict what actions  if any  the wisconsin dnr or the public commenters may take in response to these public comments 
alliant energy continues to monitor its emissions closely to determine whether additional controls will be required 
the anticipated additional capital investments for cair and camr compliance discussed above should contribute to improvements in opacity emissions 
however  should more stringent opacity limits be required  the timing of investments and control equipment options to comply with these multiple regulatory requirements will need further evaluation 
there have been instances where citizen groups have pursued claims against utilities for alleged air permitting violations 
while ipl and wpl have not received any such claims to date  wpl is aware of certain public comments that have been submitted to the wisconsin dnr regarding the renewal of an air operating permit for one of wpl s generating facilities and that a certain citizen group has filed a petition with the wisconsin dnr regarding modification of an air operating permit for another wpl generating facility 
wpl is unable to predict what actions  if any  the wisconsin dnr or the public commenters may take in response to these public comments 
alliant energy is also currently monitoring various other potential federal  state and local environmental rulemakings and activities  including  but not limited to litigation of various federal rules issued under the statutory authority of the clean air act amendments  revisions to the new source review and prevention of significant deterioration permitting programs  regional haze evaluations for best available retrofit technology  ozone requirements for reasonably available control technology  revisions to the naaqs including particulate matter  and several other legislative and regulatory proposals regarding the control of emission of air pollutants and greenhouse gases  including carbon dioxide  from a variety of sources  including generating facilities 
water quality the epa regulation under the clean water act referred to as b became effective in this regulation requires existing large generating facilities with cooling water intake structures to apply technology to minimize adverse environmental impacts to fish and other aquatic life 
ipl and wpl have initially identified and generating facilities  respectively  which they believe are impacted by b and are currently preparing evaluations of the potential impacts of the rule 
in january  a court decision on this rule remanded some aspects of the rule to the epa for further consideration 
ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict the final outcome  however expect that required capital investments and or modifications resulting from this regulation could be significant 
wpl is also currently evaluating proposed revisions to the wisconsin administrative code concerning the amount of heat that wpl s generating facilities can discharge into wisconsin waters 
at this time  wpl is unable to predict the final outcome  but believes that required capital investments and or modifications resulting from this regulation could be significant 
in  ferc issued an order requiring wpl to develop a detailed engineering and biological evaluation of potential fish passages  to install an agency approved fish protective device within one year and within three years to install an agency approved fish passage at one of wpl s hydroelectric generating facilities 
wpl is working with the appropriate federal and state agencies to comply with these provisions and research solutions 
in  wpl filed a one year extension request with ferc for the detailed engineering and biological evaluation of potential fish passages and installation of an agency approved fish protective device 
in october  ferc approved the extension for completing the evaluation and installation for the downstream fish passage to april and upstream fish passage to april in january  the federal and state agencies requested additional changes and further analysis on the fish passage designs 
wpl is currently evaluating these latest agency requests and plans to file a new extension request with ferc in the third quarter of wpl believes that required capital investments and or modifications resulting from this issue could be significant

ipl had previously been served a complaint in  filed by the mew site trust fund  the potentially responsible party group involved 
the epa has alleged million of costs incurred to date related to the mew site 
ipl believes that it is not liable for costs associated with the site because it did not arrange for the disposal of any waste materials at the site  and intends to defend this lawsuit which is currently scheduled for trial in april although ipl believes it has strong defenses  ipl is currently unable to predict the outcome of this lawsuit 
in  ipl received notification from the iowa dnr regarding groundwater monitoring of four of its closed ash landfills and the need to evaluate potential offsite groundwater impacts at two of its closed landfills 
the iowa dnr approved ipl s plans to evaluate potential offsite groundwater impacts at these two landfills  which were implemented beginning april work was completed at one of the landfills in june  with work still pending at the other landfill due to delays with obtaining access agreements from neighboring property owners 
the iowa dnr is aware of the access agreement delays and may intercede with the property owners if necessary 
ipl provides periodic updates on the status of implementing the monitoring plan to the iowa dnr 
monitoring results will be used to determine if further measures are required and ipl is currently unable to predict the outcome 
alliant energy is also monitoring various other land and solid waste regulatory changes 
this includes a potential epa regulation for management of coal combustion product in landfills and surface impoundments that could require installation of monitoring wells at some facilities and an ongoing expanded groundwater monitoring program 
compliance with the polychlorinated biphenyls pcb fix it rule persistent organic pollutants treaty could possibly require replacement of all electrical equipment containing pcb insulating fluid which is a substance known to be harmful to human health 
the wisconsin department of commerce is proposing new rules related to flammable  combustible and hazardous liquids stored in above ground storage tanks in which the primary financial impact would be from a secondary containment requirement for all hazardous materials tanks and for hazardous material unloading areas 
alliant energy is unable to predict the outcome of these possible regulatory changes at this time  but currently believes that the required capital investment and or modifications resulting from these potential regulations could be significant 
refer to note e of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements  business and construction and acquisition expenditures for further discussion of environmental matters 
other matters market risk sensitive instruments and positions alliant energy s primary market risk exposures are associated with commodity prices  interest rates and equity prices 
alliant energy has risk management policies to monitor and assist in controlling these market risks and uses derivative instruments to manage some of the exposures 
refer to notes m and of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of alliant energy s derivative financial instruments 
commodity price risk alliant energy is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the commodity price and transportation costs of electric  coal and natural gas products it procures and markets 
alliant energy employs established policies and procedures to mitigate its risks associated with these market fluctuations including the use of various commodity derivatives and contracts of various durations for the forward sale and purchase of these commodities 
alliant energy s exposure to commodity price risks in its utility business is also significantly mitigated by the current rate making structures in place for recovery of its electric fuel and purchased energy costs fuel related costs as well as its cost of natural gas purchased for resale 
ipl s retail electric and gas tariffs and wpl s wholesale electric tariffs provide for subsequent adjustments to its rates for changes in commodity costs thereby eliminating price risk for prudently incurred commodity costs 
wpl s retail gas tariffs provide for subsequent adjustments to its natural gas rates for changes in the current monthly natural gas commodity price index 
also  wpl currently has a gas performance incentive which includes a sharing mechanism whereby gains and losses relative to current commodity prices  as well as other benchmarks  are shared by wpl and its retail customers 
such rate mechanisms  combined with commodity derivatives discussed above  significantly reduce commodity risk associated with ipl s retail electric and retail gas margins and wpl s wholesale electric and retail gas margins 
however  wpl s retail electric margins are more exposed to the impact of changes in commodity prices due largely to the current retail recovery mechanisms in place in wisconsin for fuel related costs 
wpl s retail electric rates are based on forecasts of forward looking test year periods and include estimates of future fuel related costs anticipated during the test year 
during each electric retail rate proceeding for wpl  the pscw sets fuel monitoring ranges based on the forecasted fuel related costs used to determine rates 
if wpl s actual fuel related costs fall outside these fuel monitoring ranges during the test year period  wpl can request and the pscw can authorize an adjustment to future retail electric rates 
as part of this process  the pscw may authorize an interim fuel related rate increase or decrease until final rates are determined 
however  if an interim rate increase is granted and the final rate increase is less than the interim rate increase  wpl would refund the excess collection to customers at the current authorized return on equity rate 
as part of wpl s most recent retail rate case decision in january  the pscw approved annual forecasted fuel related costs of million or per mwh for wpl s test year and annual fuel monitoring ranges of plus or minus 
based on the current retail recovery mechanism  alliant energy and wpl have exposure to wpl s retail electric margins from increases in fuel related costs above the forecasted fuel related costs used to determine electric rates to the extent such increases are not recovered through prospective fuel only rate changes 
alliant energy and wpl have additional commodity price risk resulting from the lag inherent in obtaining any approved rate relief for potential increases in fuel related costs above the fuel monitoring ranges and the prospective nature of any rate relief which precludes wpl from recovering under recovered costs from ratepayers in the future 
refer to rates and regulatory matters utility fuel cost recovery for additional details of the retail rate recovery mechanism in wisconsin for electric fuel related costs and a discussion of potential changes to the current retail fuel cost recovery mechanism in wisconsin which may impact commodity price risk associated with wpl s future electric and gas retail margins 
alliant energy and wpl are unable to determine the anticipated impact of changes in commodity prices on their future electric margins given the uncertainty of how future fuel related costs will correlate with the retail electric rates in place and the outcome of the proposed changes to the current retail electric fuel related cost recovery rules in wisconsin 
interest rate risk alliant energy is exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of its issuance of variable rate debt  ipl s customer accounts receivable sale program and variable rate leasing agreements 
alliant energy manages this interest rate risk by limiting its variable interest rate exposure and by using interest rate swap agreements 
assuming no change in alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s consolidated financial structure  if variable interest rates were to average basis points higher lower in than in  expense would increase decrease by approximately million  million and million  respectively 
these amounts were determined by considering the impact of a hypothetical basis point increase decrease in interest rates on alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s consolidated variable rate debt held  the amount outstanding under ipl s customer accounts receivable sale program and variable rate lease balances at dec 
 equity price risk alliant energy is exposed to equity price risk as a result of its investments in debt and equity securities  including securities held by its pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
refer to critical accounting policies accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits for the impact on alliant energy s pension and other postretirement benefit costs of changes in the rate of returns earned by its plan assets  which include equity securities 
new accounting pronouncements refer to note v of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of new accounting pronouncements impacting alliant energy 
critical accounting policies based on historical experience and various other factors  alliant energy believes the following policies are critical to its business and the understanding of its results of operations as they require critical estimates be made based on the assumptions and judgment of management 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make various estimates and assumptions that affect revenues  expenses  assets  liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies 
the results of these estimates and judgments form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments 
alliant energy s management has discussed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of its board of directors 
refer to note of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of alliant energy s accounting policies and the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
regulatory assets and liabilities alliant energy s utility business is regulated by various federal and state regulatory agencies 
as a result  it qualifies for the application of statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
sfas recognizes that the actions of a regulator can provide reasonable assurance of the existence of an asset or liability 
regulatory assets or liabilities arise as a result of a difference between accounting principles generally accepted in the us and the accounting principles imposed by the regulatory agencies 
regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred as they are probable of recovery in customer rates 
regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds to customers and amounts collected in rates for which the related costs have not yet been incurred 
alliant energy s utility subsidiaries recognize regulatory assets and liabilities in accordance with the rulings of their federal and state regulators and future regulatory rulings may impact the carrying value and accounting treatment of alliant energy s regulatory assets and liabilities 
alliant energy periodically assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as regulatory environment changes  recent rate orders issued by the applicable regulatory agencies and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation 
the assumptions and judgments used by regulatory authorities continue to have an impact on the recovery of costs  the rate of return on invested capital and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates 
a change in these assumptions may result in a material impact on alliant energy s results of operations 
refer to note b of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
asset valuations long lived assets to be held and used alliant energy s consolidated balance sheets include significant long lived assets  which are not subject to recovery under sfas and are reflected in non regulated and other property  plant and equipment 
as a result  alliant energy must generate future cash flows from such assets in a non regulated environment to ensure the carrying value is not impaired 
alliant energy assesses the carrying amount and potential impairment of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors alliant energy considers in determining if an impairment review is necessary include a significant underperformance of the assets relative to historical or projected future operating results  a significant change in alliant energy s use of the acquired assets or business strategy related to such assets  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when alliant energy determines an impairment review is necessary  a comparison is made between the expected undiscounted future cash flows and the carrying amount of the asset 
if the carrying amount of the asset is the larger of the two balances  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the fair value is determined by the use of quoted market prices  appraisals  or the use of valuation techniques such as expected discounted future cash flows 
alliant energy must make assumptions regarding these estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
resources owns a mw  simple cycle  natural gas fired electric generating facility in neenah  wisconsin 
the entire power output of the facility is sold under contract to milwaukee based we energies through may alliant energy is currently reviewing its strategic alternatives for this facility beyond may as a result  alliant energy has assessed the recoverability of the carrying cost of the long lived assets of this facility by estimating the future anticipated undiscounted cash flows and the probability of each strategic alternative 
the future anticipated cash flows and probabilities of each strategic alternative are significant estimates 
a change in these estimates could result in a material asset valuation charge in the future 
at dec 
  the carrying value of the long lived assets associated with the neenah generating facility was million 
long lived assets held for sale alliant energy s assets held for sale are reviewed for possible impairment each reporting period and impairment charges are recorded if the carrying value of such assets exceeds the estimated fair value less cost to sell 
the fair values of alliant energy s assets held for sale are generally determined based upon current market information including information from recently negotiated deals and bid information received from potential buyers when available 
if current market information is not available  alliant energy estimates the fair value of its assets held for sale utilizing appraisals or valuation techniques such as expected discounted future cash flows 
alliant energy must make assumptions regarding these estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
in  alliant energy announced its intention to divest its investment in mexico as a result of its evaluation of strategic alternatives for the investment 
as a result  alliant energy has reclassified the accounting for the investment as assets held for sale and discontinued operations 
while alliant energy expects to complete the divestiture in  alliant energy is unable to provide assurance that this divestiture will occur in a timely fashion for anticipated proceeds  or that alliant energy will not incur future material valuation adjustments relating to this investment prior to  or as a result of  this anticipated divestiture 
if alliant energy is unable to complete the divestiture in a timely fashion  it may be required to reclassify the accounting for this investment from assets and liabilities held for sale and discontinued operations back to continuing operations 
at dec 
  the carrying value of alliant energy s investment in mexico was approximately million 
refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding assets held for sale 
unbilled revenues unbilled revenues are primarily associated with alliant energy s utility operations 
energy sales to individual customers are based on the reading of their meters  which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month 
at the end of each month  amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding estimated unbilled revenue is recorded 
the unbilled revenue estimate is based on daily system demand volumes  estimated customer usage by class  weather impacts  line losses and the most recent customer rates 
such process involves the use of various estimates  thus significant changes in the estimates could have a material impact on alliant energy s results of operations 
at dec 
 and  unbilled revenues associated with alliant energy s utility operations were million million at ipl and million at wpl and million million at ipl and million at wpl  respectively 
accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits alliant energy accounts for pensions and other postretirement benefits under sfas  employers accounting for pensions  sfas  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  and sfas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r 
under these rules  certain assumptions are made which represent significant estimates 
there are many factors involved in determining an entity s pension and other postretirement liabilities and costs each period including assumptions regarding employee demographics including age  life expectancies  and compensation levels  discount rates  assumed rate of returns and funding 
changes made to the plan provisions may also impact current and future pension and other postretirement costs 
alliant energy s assumptions are supported by historical data and reasonable projections and are reviewed annually with an outside actuary firm and an investment consulting firm 
as of sep 
 alliant energy s measurement date  alliant energy s future assumptions included a discount rate to calculate benefit obligations and a annual expected rate of return on investments 
in selecting an assumed discount rate  alliant energy reviews various corporate aa bond indices 
the annual expected rate of return is consistent with alliant energy s historical returns and is based on projected long term equity and bond returns  maturities and asset allocations 
a basis point change in the discount rate would result in approximate changes of million and million in alliant energy s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and million and million in pension and other postretirement benefit expense in  respectively 
a basis point change in the expected rate of return would result in an approximate change of million and million in pension and other postretirement benefit expense in  respectively 
refer to note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of the impact of a change in the medical trend rates 
income taxes alliant energy accounts for income taxes under sfas  accounting for income taxes 
under these rules  certain assumptions are made which represent significant estimates 
there are many factors involved in determining an entity s income tax assets  liabilities  benefits and expense each period 
these factors include assumptions regarding alliant energy s future taxable income and its ability to utilize tax credits and loss carryovers as well as the impacts from the completion of audits of the tax treatment of certain transactions 
alliant energy s assumptions are supported by historical data and reasonable projections and are reviewed quarterly by management 
significant changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on alliant energy s financial condition and results of operations 
alliant energy is required to adopt the provisions of fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  on jan 
 fin prescribes recognition thresholds and measurement attributes for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return

accounting for costs related to the miso wholesale energy market effective april   miso implemented the miso midwest market  a bid based energy market 
the market requires that all market participants submit day ahead and or real time bids and offers for energy at locations across the miso region 
miso then calculates the most efficient solution for all the bids and offers made in the market that day  and determines a locational marginal price which reflects the market price for energy 
as participants in the new miso midwest market  ipl and wpl are required to follow miso s instructions when dispatching generating units to support miso s responsibility for maintaining stability of the transmission system 
as participants in miso  ipl and wpl offer their generation and bid their demand into the market on an hourly basis  resulting in net receipt from or net obligation to miso for each hour of each day 
miso aggregates these hourly transactions and currently provides updated settlement statements to market participants seven      and days after each operating day 
in addition  miso and its participants also have the ability to file with ferc for settlement periods which may extend beyond days after each operating day 
each subsequent statement may contain billing adjustments which could have a material impact on alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s respective results of operations 
other future considerations in addition to items discussed earlier in mda and in risk factors in item a  the following items could impact alliant energy s future financial condition or results of operations ipl service territory ice storm in late february  an ice storm caused considerable damage to ipl s transmission and distribution lines in its iowa and minnesota service territories 
alliant energy and ipl are currently unable to determine the extent of the damage caused by the ice storm or the impact the damage will have on their future financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
incentive compensation plans alliant energy s total compensation program includes an incentive compensation program icp which provides substantially all its employees an opportunity to receive annual short term incentive cash payments based on the achievement of specific annual corporate goals including  among others  earnings per share from continuing operations and cash flows from operations 
funding of the icp is designed so that alliant energy s shareowners are entitled to all earnings up to a pre established earnings target 
after achieving such target  there is a sharing mechanism of earnings between alliant energy s shareowners and employees up to an established maximum funding amount for the icp 
in addition  the total compensation program for certain key employees includes long term incentive awards issued under an equity incentive plan eip 
refer to note b of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of outstanding awards issued under alliant energy s eip 
alliant energy is currently unable to determine what impacts these incentive compensation plans will have on its future financial condition or results of operations 
pension and other postretirement benefits costs in december  alliant energy and its subsidiaries contributed million to their pension plans 
these contributions are intended to satisfy the funding requirements for its pension plans through under the new minimum funding requirements included in the pension protection act of contributions in are expected to result in a decrease to alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s future pension and other postretirement benefits costs 
ethanol industry growth ethanol production in the us has experienced significant growth recently and continues to grow largely due to a mandate for ethanol usage in the energy policy act of and the promotion of e  a blend of ethanol and gasoline  used to fuel vehicles 
ethanol production facilities in the us are concentrated in the corn growing regions in the midwest given corn is the primary raw material used to produce ethanol 
electricity demand from these new ethanol production facilities located in alliant energy s utility service territory is expected to result in an increase in alliant energy s future electric sales volumes 
alliant energy is currently unable to estimate the positive impacts these new ethanol production facilities in its service territory will have on its future financial condition or results of operations
