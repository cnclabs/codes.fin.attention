its ceiling fans  light kits  bath strips  outdoor lighting and accessories are distributed through independent sales groups on a national basis 
each sales group is selected to represent craftmade in a specific market area 
the independent sales groups comprise a sales force of approximately sales representatives  who represent craftmade exclusively in the sale of ceiling fans in return for commissions on such sales 
during each of three fiscal years ended june   no single lighting showroom or electrical wholesaler accounted for more than of craftmade s net sales and of consolidated net sales 
sales representatives are carefully selected and continually evaluated in order to promote high level representation of craftmade s products 
craftmade employees provide initial field training to new sales representatives covering features  styles  operation and other attributes of craftmade products to enable representatives to more effectively market craftmade s products 
additional training  especially for a new product series  is provided on a regular basis at semi annual trade shows held at the company s showroom at dallas market center 
management believes it has assembled a highly motivated and effective sales representative organization that has demonstrated a strong commitment to craftmade and its products 
management further believes that the strength of its sales representative organization is primarily attributable to the quality and competitive pricing of craftmade s products  as well as the ongoing administrative and marketing support that craftmade provides to its sales representatives 
tsi 
all of tsi s sales are to mass merchandisers with lowe s companies  inc lowe s comprising of tsi s and of the company s net sales

marketing craftmade 
craftmade relies primarily on the reputation of its ceiling fans  outdoor lighting and light kits for high quality and competitive prices and the efforts of its sales representative organization in order to promote the sales of its products 
the principal markets for craftmade s products are the new home construction  remodeling and replacement markets 
craftmade utilizes advertising in home lighting magazines  particularly in special editions devoted to ceiling fans and lighting fixtures  and broadly distributes its product catalog

craftmade provides warranties ranging from years to lifetime on the fan motor of its ceiling fans  and includes a one year limited warranty against defects in workmanship and materials to cover the entire ceiling fan 
craftmade provides a limited lifetime warranty on its higher end series of fans 
the company s management believes these warranties are highly attractive to both dealers and consumers 
tsi 
tsi relies primarily on the reputation of its products  merchandising concepts and the relationship it has with its mass merchandiser customers with respect to its sales 
tsi participates in advertising programs and special promotions performed by its customers 
tsi also promotes its product line at select trade shows and line reviews held at its customers 

table of contents in general  the company has a hour product shipment policy 
in order to meet these policy delivery requirements and to ensure that it has sufficient goods on hand from its overseas suppliers  the company maintains a significant level of inventory 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
product expansion craftmade continually expands its ceiling fan product line  providing proprietary products to its customer base in order to meet current and anticipated demands for unique  innovative products 
during the fiscal year ended june   craftmade introduced new ceiling fans and three complete interior lighting families of products  including chandeliers  pendants and sconces 
each family consists of to individual fixtures and management believes that they have been well accepted by the craftmade dealers 
in addition  craftmade increased its selections of complementary products such as specialty light fixtures  including bath bars and outdoor lighting 
the company s management will continue to search for opportunities for product expansion that it considers complementary to the company s existing product lines 
for example  the company introduced a broad range of clocks and weather gauges under the durocraft brand name during the fiscal year 
seasonality the company s product sales  particularly ceiling fans  are somewhat seasonal with sales in the warmer first and fourth quarters being historically higher than in the two other fiscal quarters 
backlog backlog is not material to the company s operations as substantially all of the company s products are shipped to customers within hours following receipt of orders 
competition the ceiling fan and lighting fixture market is highly competitive at all levels of operation 
some of the major companies in the ceiling fan industry include casablanca  hunter  minka  generation brands companies  quorum  litex industries  emerson electric and taconi 
a number of other well established companies are also currently engaged in activities that compete directly with craftmade 
some of craftmade s competitors are better established and have longer operating histories  substantially greater financial resources or greater name recognition than craftmade 
however  the company s management believes that the quality of craftmade s products  the strength of its marketing organization and the growing recognition of the craftmade name will enable craftmade to compete successfully in these highly competitive markets 
the mass merchandiser market is also highly competitive 
tsi  phi  and design trends have numerous competitors  which are located both within the united states and outside of the country  particularly in asia 
some of the major companies in the lighting fixture industry include designer s fountain  generation brands  catalina  jimco lamps  j 
hunt  westinghouse  kichler and minka 
in addition  mass merchandisers themselves will  at times  compete directly against tsi  phi  and design trends by purchasing private label products directly from asian factories

the following risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and from results predicted by forward looking statements made by us related to conditions or events that we anticipate may occur in the future 
all of our forward looking statements made us are qualified by the risks described below 
the following should not be construed as an exhaustive list of all factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward looking statements 

table of contents strategic risks and strategy execution risks the ceiling fan and lighting industry is highly competitive  and we may not be able to compete successfully 
we compete with numerous companies  including several major manufacturers and distributors 
some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have  which could allow them to compete more successfully than us 
most of our products are available from several other sources  and our customers tend to have relationships with several distributors 
manufacturers could also increase their efforts to sell directly to our customers and end users and bypass distributors like us 
in the future  we may be unable to compete successfully  and competitive pressures may reduce our revenues 
if we fail to gain customer acceptance of our existing and new products  our operating results could suffer 
we sell our products primarily to lighting showrooms and mass merchandisers 
if we fail to successfully introduce new products that are accepted by our customers  our operating results may be adversely affected 
our failure in pursuing or executing any of our new business ventures  strategic alliances and acquisitions could have a material adverse impact on our business 
our growth strategy includes expansion through new business ventures  strategic alliances and acquisitions 
while we employ several different valuation methodologies to assess a potential growth opportunity  and structuring favorable payout strategies to lower risk  we can give no assurance that any of our new business ventures and strategic alliances will positively affect our financial performance 
any acquisitions that we make may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies  and may result in the diversion of our capital and management s attention from our other business issues and opportunities 
we may not be able to integrate companies that we acquire successfully  including their personnel  financial systems  distribution  operations and general operating procedures 
if we fail to integrate companies that we acquire successfully  our business could suffer materially 
we may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over our financial reporting in connection with our integration of an acquired company 
in addition  our efforts to integrate any acquired company  and its financial results  into our company may have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
our revenues depend on our relationships with capable sales personnel as well as key customers  vendors  and manufacturers of the products that we distribute to our customers 
our future operating results depend on our ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with qualified sales personnel as well as key customers  vendors and manufacturers 
if we fail to maintain our existing relationships with these parties or fail to acquire relationships with others like them in the future  our business may suffer 
our future success is substantially dependent upon our senior management and retention of key personnel 
our success depends upon our ability to attract  motivate  and retain key management and personnel 
we depend upon the continued services of our key executive officers  including the following individuals james r 
ridings chairman of the board and chief executive officer brad d 
heimann president and chief operating officer j 
marcus scrudder chief financial officer michael l 
patton chief accounting officer john s 
deblois executive vice president of tsi clifford f 
crimmings vice president of marketing the loss of services of any of our key personnel could have a negative impact on our business 

table of contents risks associated with international trade as we do not manufacture the products that we distribute  we are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of high quality competitive products on a timely basis 
we obtain over of our products from third party suppliers in china with the remainder supplied from vendors in the us we do not have long term contracts with our suppliers committing them to supply products to us 
most of our products are imported from suppliers under short term purchase orders that we place with them 
therefore  our suppliers may not provide us with the products we need in the quantities that we request 
because we do not control the actual production of the products that we sell  we may be subject to delays caused by interruption in production based on conditions outside of our control 
political or financial instability  merchandise quality issues  trade restrictions  tariffs  currency exchange rates  transportation capacity and costs  inflation  outbreak of pandemics and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control 
in the event that any of our third party suppliers become unable or unwilling to continue to provide us with products in the volumes that we require  we would need to identify and obtain acceptable replacement sources on a timely basis 
there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain such alternative sources of supply on a timely basis  if at all  or at costs acceptable to us 
an extended interruption in the supply of our products would have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations  which most likely would adversely affect the value of our common stock 
risks related to profitable growth a decline in general economic condition  particularly the housing  home construction  and remodel sectors  could lead to reduced demand for our products 
general economic conditions in the us  including the housing and home construction sectors  are affected by  among other things  consumer spending habits  levels of employment  salary and wage rates  prevailing interest rates  income tax rates and policies  consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions 
a decline in general economic conditions in the us could lead to a reduced demand for our products 
the loss of certain of our customers that represent a significant percentage of our net sales could adversely affect our results of operations 
all of tsi s net sales  including the net sales of phi and design trends  are made to mass merchandisers with lowe s comprising the most significant portion of tsi s and our consolidated net sales 
the loss of or reduction in our orders with this customer  or any other significant customer  could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results  as could disputes with our customers regarding shipments  fees  product condition or related matters 
our inability to collect accounts receivable from any of these customers could also have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
if net sales to these customers are at levels significantly lower than currently anticipated  we would be required to find other customers for existing inventory on hand 
there can be no assurances that we would be able to obtain additional customers for this inventory or that any alternative sources would generate similar sales levels and profit margins as anticipated with these current mass merchandiser customers 
we do not have long term sales agreements with or other contractual assurances as to future sales from any of our customers 
our customers make purchase decisions based on a combination of price  product quality  consumer demand  customer service performance and their desired inventory levels 
changes in our customers strategies  including a reduction in the number of brands they carry or a shift of shelf space to private label products unless we provide such products may adversely affect our net sales 
additionally  our customers may face financial or other difficulties that may impact their operations and their purchases from us  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
if our net sales of products to one or more of our customers are reduced  this reduction may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our mass merchandise customers may pressure us to lower our prices or take other actions that may adversely impact our results of operations 
mass merchandisers  including lowe s and wal mart  require various stipulations from their vendors related to inventory practices  product reset costs  logistics or other aspects of the customer supplier relationship 
for example  wal mart and other customers have indicated a desire to utilize radio frequency identification rfid technology in an effort to improve tracking and management of product in their supply chain 
large scale implementation of this technology would significantly increase our product manufacturing and distribution costs 
meeting these types of demands of customers may adversely affect our margins and results of operations 
if we fail to effectively respond to these types of demands of our customers  our sales and profitability could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  our mass merchandise customers hold line reviews throughout the year for each product category 
line reviews give us the potential to add new sku s  however  participation in line reviews could also result in a partial or complete reduction of our existing sku s in the product lines currently offered 
our mass merchandise customers may choose to source many of the products we provide directly themselves 
we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors 
as a result  there are ongoing competitive product and pricing pressures in the environments in which we operate  as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins 
to address these challenges  we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors  including pricing  promotional incentives and trade terms 
in particular  our mass merchandise customers may choose to source many of the products we provide directly from manufacturers in asia 
to the extent our mass merchandiser customers purchase products in excess of consumer consumption in any period  our net sales in a subsequent period may be adversely affected as mass merchandisers seek to reduce their inventory levels 
from time to time  mass merchandisers may purchase more products from us than they expect to sell to consumers during a particular time period 
if mass merchandisers increase their inventory during a particular reporting period  then our sales during the subsequent reporting period may be adversely impacted as these mass merchandisers seek to reduce their inventory to usual levels 
to the extent our customers seek to reduce their usual or customary inventory levels  the impact of such de inventorying on our sales and profitability would be even greater 
increases in our shipping costs or service trouble with our third party shippers could harm our business 
shipping is a significant expense in our business for the products we import from manufacturers and the products we ship to customers 
any significant increase we experience in our shipping rates could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
similarly  strikes or other service interruptions by those shippers could cause our operating expenses to rise and adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis 
we experience fluctuations in our quarterly earnings 
as a result  we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could cause our stock price to decline or be highly volatile 
our product sales  particularly ceiling fans  are subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations 
our net sales and operating profits generally have been higher in the first and fourth quarters from the warmer weather during these months 
our quarterly results may also be adversely affected by a variety of other factors  including the timing of our new product releases  costs related to our acquisitions and or integrations of businesses that we may acquire  timing and amount of our sales and marketing expenditures  timing of our orders from mass merchandisers  our commitments to mass merchandisers  including charge backs for returns and defective merchandise  
table of contents loss of any of our sales representatives  general economic conditions that may affect us  including those in the housing sector  establishing or maintaining our business relationships  and changes in our accounting principles 
these and other factors could affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations  and this makes the prediction of our financial results on a quarterly basis difficult 
in addition  the nasdaq global market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on nasdaq 
broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of actual operating performance 
in the past  periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities has often been followed by securities class action litigation instituted against companies 
this type of litigation  if instituted  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources  which would harm us 
risks relating to liquidity our inability to meet financial covenants contained in our credit facilities could adversely impact our ability to fund our operations 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund our planned capital expenditures  acquisitions  and dividends will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this  to some extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
we cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from our operating activities or that future borrowings will be available under our credit facility in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness  on or before maturity 
we cannot provide assurance that we would be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
our credit facility contains restrictive covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios 
our ability to satisfy those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control  and we cannot provide assurance that we will satisfy those ratios 
a breach by us of any of these financial ratio covenants or other covenants could result in our being in default under our credit facility 
upon the occurrence of an event of default by us  our lenders could elect to declare the applicable outstanding indebtedness due immediately and payable and terminate all commitments to us to extend further credit 
we cannot be sure that our lenders would waive a default or that we could pay the outstanding indebtedness in full under our credit facility if it were accelerated by our lenders 
we are exposed to the risk of an increase in interest rates 
we do not have any agreements with third parties to hedge against the potential rising of interest rates 
the variable rates of interest on our credit facility are comprised of libor plus the spread as defined by the loan agreements 
as a result of our existing variable rate credit lines and loan agreements  we are exposed to risk from fluctuations in interest rates 
we are exposed to the risk of foreign currency appreciation 
generally  we purchase our products in us dollars 
however  we source our products from overseas manufacturers in the people s republic of china 
as a result  our costs of these products may be affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies 
these foreign currencies include the chinese yuan 
we cannot be assured that foreign currency fluctuations will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 

table of contents risks associated with dependence on technology we rely heavily on our management information systems for inventory management  distribution and other functions 
if our systems fail to perform these functions adequately or if we experience an interruption in our operations  we could be materially adversely affected 
the efficient operation of our company is dependent on our management information systems 
we rely heavily on our management information systems to manage our order entry  order fulfillment  pricing  point of sale  and inventory replenishment processes 
the failure of our management information systems to perform as anticipated could disrupt our business and could result in decreased revenue  increased overhead costs  and excess or out of stock inventory levels  causing us to suffer materially 
regulatory risks tax legislation initiatives could adversely affect our net earnings and tax liabilities 
we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the united states  state and local governments  as well as foreign jurisdictions 
from time to time  various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions 
there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate will not be adversely affected by these initiatives 
in addition  tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations 
although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws  regulations and existing precedent  we cannot give assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities  or that we would be successful in any such challenge 
we are subject to increasingly complex corporate governance  public disclosure  accounting  and tax requirements that have increased our costs and the risk of our not being in compliance with these requirements 
we are subject to rules and regulations of federal and state government as well as the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed 
these entities  including the public company accounting oversight board pcaob  the sec  the internal revenue service  and the nasdaq stock market  have issued a significant number of new and increasingly complex requirements and regulations over the course of the last several years and continue to develop additional regulations and requirements in response to laws enacted by congress  most notably the sarbanes oxley act of our efforts to comply with these requirements have resulted in  and are likely to continue to result in  increased expenses and a diversion of our management s time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
we also are subject to periodic audits or other reviews by these governmental agencies and external auditors 
these examinations or reviews frequently require management s time and diversion of internal resources and  in the event of an unfavorable outcome to us  may result in additional liabilities or adjustments to our historical financial results 
recent changes in accounting rules  including the expensing of stock options granted to our employees  could have a material impact on our reported business and financial results 
the us generally accepted accounting principles are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board fasb  the american institute of certified public accountants  the pcaob  the sec  and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles 
a change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto 
statements regarding future economic performance  management s plans and objectives  and any statements concerning assumptions related to the foregoing contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation constitute forward looking statements 
certain factors  which may cause actual results to vary materially from these forward looking statements  accompany such statements or appear elsewhere in this form k  including the factors disclosed under item a 
risk factors 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company s management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company s estimates are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for the company s conclusions 
the company continually evaluates the information used to make these estimates as its business and the economic environment changes 
the company s management believes that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on its financial statements  so the company considers these to be its critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized as product is shipped and related services are performed in accordance with all applicable revenue recognition criteria 
for these transactions the company applies the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  title and risk of loss have passed  delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
title generally transfers upon shipment of goods from the company s warehouse 
the company does not have an obligation or policy of replacing customer products damaged or lost in transit 
in some instances  the company ships product directly from its suppliers to the customers 
in these cases  the company recognizes revenue when the product is accepted by the customer s representative 
the company applies the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
the company s application of eitf includes evaluation of its terms with each major customer relative to a number of criteria that management considers in making its determination with respect to gross versus net reporting of revenue for transactions with its customers 
management s criteria for making these judgments place particular emphasis on determining the primary obligor in a transaction and which party bears general inventory risk 
the company records all shipping and handling fees billed to customers as revenue  and related costs as cost of sales  when incurred  in accordance with eitf  accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs 
as part of its revenue recognition policy  the company records an accrual of estimated incentives payable to its customers as a reduction of revenue at the time the related revenues are recorded 
the company bases its estimates on contractual terms of the programs and estimated or actual sales to individual customers 
actual incentives payable in any future period are inherently uncertain and  thus  may differ from its estimates 
if actual or expected incentives were significantly greater than the reserves the company had established  the company would record a reduction to net revenues in the period in which the company made such determination 
in addition to various incentive programs  from time to time  the company is required to provide mark down funds to certain of its mass retail customers to assist them in clearing slow moving inventory 
these mark down funds are accrued as a reduction of revenue at the time that the related revenues are recorded 

table of contents the company is also required to provide for the cost of labor associated with resetting store displays 
resets involve removing slow moving inventory and replacing it with new products 
although reset costs are paid to third parties who perform the services  they are considered an incentive to our mass merchandise customers 
for existing products that are replaced  the company accrues an estimate for the cost as in increase to cost of goods sold in advance of the reset at the time that the related revenues are recorded 
the company bases its estimates on a number of factors  including information obtained from our clients about their future plans 
the cost for any new products or space that is gained is expensed as incurred as an increase to cost of goods sold 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company regularly analyzes significant customer balances  and  when it becomes evident a specific customer will be unable to meet its financial obligations to the company  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position  a specific allowance for doubtful account is recorded to reduce the related receivable to the amount that is believed reasonably collectible 
the company also records allowances for doubtful accounts for all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due  the financial health of the customer and historical experiences 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted 
inventories the company s inventories are primarily comprised of finished goods and are recorded at the lower of cost or market using the average cost method 
the company provides estimated inventory allowances for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventory as well as inventory whose carrying value is in excess of net realizable value 
these reserves are based on current assessments about future demands  market conditions and related management initiatives 
if market conditions and actual demands are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill the company assesses the carrying values of goodwill annually or when circumstances dictate that the carrying value might be impaired 
impairment testing for goodwill is analyzed at the reporting unit level 
an impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using discounted cash flow analysis 
in the event that an impairment is determined to have occurred  the company will reduce the carrying value of the asset in that period 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
in estimating future tax consequences  all expected future events other than enactments of changes in the tax law or rates are considered 
deferred income taxes have been provided on unremitted earnings from foreign investees 
the company reviews its deferred tax assets for ultimate realization and will record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset if it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of these deferred tax assets will not be realized 
tax authorities may not always agree with the tax positions taken by the company 
the company believes it has adequate reserves in the event that a taxing authority differs with positions taken  however  there can be no assurance that the company s results will not be affected adversely

overview management reviews a number of key indicators to evaluate the company s financial performance  including net sales  gross profit and selling  general and administrative expenses by segment 
a condensed overview of results for the fiscal year ended june  and the corresponding prior year period is summarized in the table that follows in thousands  except percentage data 
fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  income statement by segment dollars in thousands fiscal year ended fiscal year ended june  june  craftmade tsi total craftmade tsi total net sales cost of goods sold gross profit gross profit as a of net sales selling  general and administrative expenses as a of net sales depreciation and amortization total operating expenses income from operations interest expense  net other expenses income before income taxes and minority interests provision for income taxes income before minority interests minority interests net income net sales 
net sales for the company decreased  or to  for the fiscal year ended june   compared to  for the fiscal year ended june   primarily from a decline in net sales of the tsi segment 
net sales from the craftmade segment decreased  or to  for the fiscal year ended june   from  for the fiscal year ended june  the decline was primarily due to a continued decrease in demand for decorative ceiling fans and accolade lighting products as a result of the weak overall housing market 
these decreases were partially offset by a increase in net sales of teiber product lines and an increase in net sales from the durocraft product line consisting of clocks and weather gauges 

table of contents management continues to focus on introducing new lighting products  expanding teiber accounts and developing new accounts for the durocraft product lines to offset the weak housing market 
management believes that long term growth will be favorably affected by more competitive product sourcing and additional product offerings through enhanced product development efforts 
net sales of the tsi segment declined  or to  for the fiscal year ended june  from  for the fiscal year ended june   as summarized in the following table net sales of tsi segment dollars in thousands trade design segment fiscal year ended source trends total june  june  dollar decrease percent decrease the decrease in net sales of trade source was primarily the result of a decline in orders from lowe s related to indoor lighting  outdoor lighting and fan accessories 
on november   lowe s notified trade source that it will no longer source the indoor and outdoor lighting sku s previously sold to lowe s via direct import 
management has been told that lowe s will be sourcing these products directly from various overseas manufacturers 
trade source shipped all outstanding orders of discontinued products as of january  the decline in design trends net sales was primarily due to the previously disclosed reduction of sku s sold to lowe s in the seven of regional distribution centers that design trends supplied 
beginning in april  design trends began providing approximately of the sku s in the mix and match portable lamp display set marketed under lowe s private label as compared to in prior periods 
management also believes that the decrease in net sales of design trends resulted from reduced demand primarily due to current economic conditions related to the housing industry and other factors that are within the realm of the retailer s control 
this decline in design trends was partially offset by an increase in net sales to four additional lowe s distribution centers 
in november  design trends began supplying a portion of its mix and match portable lamps to the four additional lowe s regional distribution centers that design trends had not been supplying since the quarter ended september  as a result  design trends supplies mix and match portable lamps to all lowe s regional distribution centers 
based on the most recent annual line review  management believes that lowe s remains committed to the lighting program with design trends 
management believes that based on the amount of product currently shipped to lowe s  design trends continues to be a primary portable lamp vendor for lowe s mix and match portable lamp program 
design trends has been invited to participate in each of lowe s scheduled line reviews for its existing and new product lines 
the line reviews occur throughout the year for each product category and give both trade source and design trends the potential to add new sku s  however  participation in line reviews could also result in a partial or complete reduction of either subsidiary s existing sku s in the product lines currently offered to lowe s 
management believes that the future growth of the tsi segment is contingent upon the success of the company s ongoing efforts to introduce new products  product lines and marketing concepts to existing customers and to expand the business to new customers 
gross profit

in addition  trade source benefited from lower costs associated with markdowns and product resets primarily as a result of the previously described loss of the indoor and outdoor lighting product orders by lowe s 
on the other hand  design trends gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily as a result of higher amounts set aside for vendor programs with lowe s as compared to the prior fiscal year 
for fiscal year  gross profit as a percentage of net sales of the tsi segment is expected to remain consistent with the fiscal year ended june   provided that the segment maintains a sales mix  customer concentration  and level of vendor program commitment similar to what it maintained during fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses

depreciation and amortization expense of the company increased  to  for the fiscal year ended june   compared to  for the same period last year 
the increase resulted from depreciation and amortization of the fixed assets  non compete covenants and intellectual property obtained by the company as a result of the acquisition of marketing impressions 
see note acquisitions in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
interest expense 
net interest expense of the company increased  to  for the fiscal year ended june  from  for the fiscal year ended june  this increase was primarily the result of i higher interest rates in effect during the fiscal year ended june   compared to the prior fiscal year and ii higher average outstanding balances on the company s sources of debt as a result of cash used to fund the acquisition of marketing impressions and increases in inventory due to the transition of ceiling fan manufacturing from taiwan to china 
minority interests 
minority interests decreased  to  for the fiscal year ended june   compared to  for the same period in the previous fiscal year 
the decrease in minority interests resulted from the acquisition of marketing impressions which increased the company s effective ownership of phi to and eliminated minority interest in connection with phi 
the decrease in minority interests was also impacted by decreased profits at design trends as a result of the decline in net sales as previously discussed 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income tax was  or of income before income taxes for the fiscal year ended june   compared to  or of income before taxes for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in effective rate primarily resulted from anticipated refunds from lower state apportionment rates applied to prior periods and a reduction in amounts set aside for tax contingencies

net sales for the company decreased  or to  for the fiscal year ended june   compared to  for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in net sales resulted from a decrease in net sales of the tsi segment  partially offset by stronger net sales of the craftmade segment 
net sales from the craftmade segment increased  or to  for the fiscal year ended june  from  for the fiscal year ended june  the increase resulted from  of incremental net sales from the product lines associated with the march  acquisition of teiber as the teiber customer base continues to expand 
the current fiscal year includes months of teiber  compared to four months in the prior year 
the remaining  increase in sales of the craftmade segment resulted from an increase in sales partially due to newly introduced products such as durocraft gauges  the builder targeted ceiling fans and accolade lighting products 
net sales of the tsi segment declined  or to  for the fiscal year ended june  from  for the fiscal year ended june  increases in phi s net sales were offset by decreases in trade source and design trends net sales  as summarized in the following table net sales of tsi segment dollars in thousands tsi trade design segment fiscal year ended source trends phi total june  june  dollar increase decrease percent increase decrease 
table of contents the decrease in trade source net sales was primarily the result of a sales decline from the wal mart indoor outdoor lighting and mix and match fan program 
historically  trade source has provided wal mart with these products by direct import from asia 
wal mart now sources a significant amount of these products directly with the balance still being provided by trade source 
the decrease in net sales also resulted from phi s fan accessory sales in the current fiscal year that were made by trade source in the prior fiscal year 
strong sales of promotional lighting items  window covering treatments  and non core products offset the decrease in net sales 
the decline in design trends net sales was primarily due to the previously disclosed loss of four of lowe s regional distribution centers in an attempt by lowe s to mitigate the risk associated with maintaining a sole supplier for a given product line  and a change in lowe s merchandising system 
during the fiscal year ended june   lowe s decided to change its merchandising concept to one that will be based on lowe s private label  which resulted in the discontinuance of the design trends merchandising display 
the company was asked to repurchase a portion of the existing inventory under the old design trends packaging and replace it with lowe s private label packaging 
design trends agreed to replace a portion of the inventory and as a result  design trends initially offered and is currently offering approximately of the items in the new set for the lowe s stores supplied by the seven of regional distribution centers that it currently services 
the increase in net sales of phi primarily resulted from increased sales of the fan accessory and lamp replacement parts business to lowe s

this was partially offset by benefits obtained in the fiscal year from the temporary exemption of the duty on imported ceiling fans as prescribed by the ajca

interest expense 
net interest expense of the company increased  to  for the fiscal year ended june  from  for the fiscal year ended june  this increase was primarily the result of higher interest rates in effect during the period on the company s outstanding revolving line of credit with frost bank  offset by the effects of a reduction in overall interest bearing debt 
the average outstanding balance on the company s facility note was lower during the fiscal year than during the fiscal year  while the interest rate on the facility note remained unchanged during the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year 
minority interests 
minority interests generated by the company s owned subsidiaries decreased  to  for the fiscal year ended june   compared to  for the same period in the previous year

provision for income taxes 
the provision for income tax was  or of income before income taxes  for the fiscal year ended june   compared to  or of income before taxes for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in the provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes primarily resulted from lower state taxes and the tax benefit obtained from the repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings under the ajca

net cash provided by the company s operating activities decreased  to  for the fiscal year ended june   compared to  for the same period last year 
the decrease in cash flow from operations resulted primarily from a lower net income  b lower accounts payable from the settlement of balances arising from the acquisition of marketing impressions and c a reduction in accrued customer allowances primarily from the loss of the indoor and outdoor lighting business with lowe s 
these amounts were offset by lower accounts receivable and inventory balances driven in part by lower net sales in the current fiscal year

cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from i cash dividends of  ii distributions to minority interest members totaling  and iii principal payments on the company s notes payable of  these amounts were offset by  of proceeds from our line of credit 
the company s management believes that its current lines of credit  combined with cash flows from operations  are adequate to fund the company s current operating needs  debt service payments and any future dividend payments  as well as its projected growth over the next twelve months 
in the event that the company requires additional capital for growth  management believes that the company can obtain favorable refinancing of its warehouse facility 
there can be no assurances  however  that any type of financing arrangement will be consummated 
management anticipates that future cash flows will be used primarily to retire existing debt  pay dividends  fund potential acquisitions or other investments that will enhance long term shareholder value and distribute earnings to its minority interest member 
the company remains committed to its business strategy of creating long term earnings growth  maximizing stockholder value through internal improvements  making selective acquisitions and dispositions of assets  focusing on cash flow and retaining quality personnel 
management believes that given the current volatility in the housing and debt markets  it is in the best interest of long term shareholder value to pursue selective and opportunistic acquisitions in order to achieve more advantageous growth objectives through enhanced product offerings and potentially expanding into adjacent product categories and sales channels  which will be less reliant on the overall housing environment 
the company is currently evaluating several acquisition candidates and is currently engaged in discussions with some of them
