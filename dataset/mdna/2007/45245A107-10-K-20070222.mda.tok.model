item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview imation is a leading provider of removable data storage media products designed to help our customers capture  create  protect  preserve and retrieve valuable digital assets 
our business to business customers range from managers of large data centers to distributed network administrators to small business owners who rely on our tape cartridges for data processing  security  business continuity  backup and archiving applications 
for personal storage needs  our customers rely on our recordable optical discs  usb flash drives  flash cards and removable hard drives to store  edit and manage data  photos  video  images and music on business and home computers 
our products are sold in approximately countries 
the data storage market presents attractive growth opportunities as well as challenges 
demand for storage capacity is growing rapidly 
new formats deliver greater capacity in a single piece of storage media  which results in overall revenue growth being lower than the overall growth in demand for storage capacity 
the market is highly competitive  characterized by continuing changes in technology  ongoing variable price erosion  diverse distribution channels and a large variety of brands and formats for tape  optical  flash and removable hard disk products which may be subject to consolidation 
we deliver a broad portfolio of products across multiple brands through diverse distribution channels and geographies 
success in the market is dependent on several factors  including being early to market with new formats and having efficient manufacturing  sourcing and supply chain operations  working closely with leading oems to develop new formats or enhancements to existing formats  offering a broad assortment of products across multiple competing drive technology platforms  having broad geographic and market coverage and maintaining strong brand management capabilities across diverse distribution channels 
the highest revenue growth opportunities include removable flash memory  recordable optical discs  newer tape formats in open system environments and a newer product category  removable hard disks 
these higher revenue growth opportunities provide revenue streams that are typically at lower gross profit margins than our historical gross profit margins on our proprietary magnetic media products 
our strategy is to maintain a relatively flat and efficient operating structure as we take advantage of these growth opportunities by establishing strategic sourcing  brand distribution and licensing arrangements 
for example  while we have manufacturing operations and intellectual property  including patents and know how across a broad range of storage related media technologies  we also source products from third party manufacturers 
as a result  our revenue is derived from a combination of manufactured and sourced products 
we believe this strategy supports higher revenue without the need to add substantial infrastructure or overhead costs  thus delivering increased gross margin dollars and operating profit growth on increased revenue as well as a return on invested capital above our weighted average cost of capital 
in addition  we are implementing lean enterprise principles that emphasize speed  quality and competitive cost across all key functions and processes 
factors affecting comparability of our financial results memorex acquisition on april   we closed on the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of memorex  including the memorex brand name and the capital stock of its operating subsidiaries engaged in the business of the design  development  marketing  sourcing  distribution and sale of hardware  media and accessories used for the storage of electronic data under

this product mix change is primarily due to the acquisition of memorex  which has a business model that carries products with lower gross margin percentages and lower operating expense ratios 
on a product by product basis  our margin percentage showed improved performance in in magnetic  optical and usb flash drive product categories when compared with our gross margin was substantially in line with our gross margin  however  the gross margin was impacted by certain items discussed below 
two factors negatively impacting gross margin in were inventory related 
table of contents charges as well as start up costs related to our coating facility in weatherford  oklahoma 
the inventory related charges were driven by competitive market pricing during the second quarter of  which caused inventory valuation write downs of million recorded as cost of goods sold and price protection payments of million recorded as reductions of revenue 
the start up costs were incurred as resources were added ahead of the commencement of production on our weatherford coater 
improvement in the performance of the new coater caused gross margin to improve by percentage points when comparing with this improvement  however  was more than offset by the decrease in gross margin due to a higher proportion of lower gross margin products in the overall sales mix

segment results during the second quarter of  we reorganized our operational structure following the memorex acquisition 
as a result  we changed our reportable segments to reflect how we manage our business 
we operate in one industry segment selling removable data storage media and accessories for use in the personal storage  network and enterprise data center markets 
our business is organized  managed and internally reported as segments differentiated by the regional markets we serve americas  europe and asia pacific 
each of these segments has the responsibility for selling virtually all of our product lines 
we evaluate segment performance based on net revenue and operating income 
net revenue for each segment is generally based on customer location 
the operating income reported in our segments excludes corporate and other unallocated amounts 
although such amounts are excluded from the business segment results  they are included in reported consolidated earnings 
corporate and unallocated amounts include research and development expense  corporate expense  stock based compensation expense and restructuring and other expenses which are not allocated to the regional segments 
we believe this avoids distorting the operating income for the regional segments

the americas net revenue growth of percent in was driven by additional revenue from usb flash drive and optical products  partially offset by the decline in magnetic products 

table of contents the decline of operating income as a percentage of revenue for our americas segment was due to our anticipated product mix migration as we realized increases in revenue from optical and usb flash drive products  which carry lower gross margins than some of our magnetic products 
the increase of operating income as a percentage of revenue was due to improved margins in the optical and usb flash drive product categories  partially offset by decreased revenue from magnetic products which are higher margin products

the lower operating loss in was 
table of contents attributed to costs of million associated with our restructuring programs  as well as a decrease in our r d spending 
financial position as of december   the cash and cash equivalents balance was million  a decrease of million compared to december  the decrease was due to the net cash payment for the memorex acquisition of million and capital expenditures of million 
these outflows were partially offset by operating cash flows of million and proceeds from sales of investments of million 
as of december   we had other cash investments of million related to investment grade interest bearing securities with original maturities greater than three months that were classified as other current assets 
our other cash investments as of december  matured in  and as a result  there were no cash investments in other current assets as of december  accounts receivable days sales outstanding was days as of december   up days from december  days sales outstanding is calculated using the count back method  which calculates the number of days of most recent revenue that is reflected in the net accounts receivable balance 
the majority of the increase was due to an increased presence in retail channels from our memorex acquisition which carries relatively higher payment terms than the rest of our business 
days of inventory supply was days as of december   up days compared with days as of december  days of inventory supply is calculated using the current period inventory balance divided by the average of the inventoriable portion of cost of goods sold for the previous months  expressed in days

in late  we paid million to enter into a tape media distribution agreement with exabyte whereby we became the exclusive distributor of exabyte media including the vxa class of tape cartridges 
this transaction resulted in an intangible asset of million 
on october   we amended certain terms of the exabyte distribution agreement whereby we agreed to lower the margin we earn on distribution in exchange for consideration of million in the form of exabyte common stock  preferred stock and warrants collectively  stock holdings and notes receivable with a corresponding offset to the original intangible asset recorded in conjunction with the execution of the original exabyte distribution agreement 
due to the decline in value of exabyte common stock  we determined that other than temporary impairments in our investment in exabyte holdings existed in consequently  we reduced the carrying value of our exabyte holdings by million with a corresponding loss recorded in other expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
as of december   our exabyte stock holdings had been fully written off 
the exabyte notes receivables consisted of a million note  bearing percent interest beginning january   with interest only payments through and quarterly principal and interest payments commencing on march  and continuing through december  the notes receivables also consisted of a million note bearing percent interest through december   at which time the principal amount was due 

table of contents on november   tandberg completed the acquisition of substantially all of the exabyte assets and the exabyte tape media distribution agreement was assigned to tandberg 
as a result of the acquisition  we restructured the exabyte notes receivable agreement 
in connection with the notes restructuring agreement  we received million of the million previously due december   and all interest accrued but not paid  on the outstanding notes receivables 
tandberg replaced the million note with a million note the note 
the note bears interest at percent beginning november   payable quarterly with principal payments commencing on december  and continuing through december  in addition  in conjunction with the note restructuring agreement  tandberg will increase the margin we earn on distribution by two percentage points  effective january   until such time that we recover the forgiven principal amount on both notes totaling million 
in connection with the restructuring of our notes receivable and distribution agreements  we recorded a loss of million during  which represents lost interest income on the notes receivable 
the collection of the note receivable and realization of the intangible asset is dependent on the continued success of our relationship with tandberg 
at december   we believe the recorded note is collectible 
however  future events may impact this assessment

as of december   we did not have any debt outstanding 
on march   we entered into a credit agreement with a group of banks that expires on march  that replaced our prior credit facility that would have expired on december  the credit agreement provides for revolving credit  including letters of credit  with borrowing availability of million 
borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest  at our option  at either a the higher of the federal funds rate plus percent or the rate of interest published by bank of america as its prime rate plus  in each case  up to percent depending on the applicable leverage ratio  as described below  or b the british bankers association libor  adjusted by the reserve percentage in effect from time to time  as determined by the federal reserve board  plus up to percent depending on the applicable leverage ratio 
leverage ratio is defined as the ratio of total debt to ebitda 
a facility fee ranging from to percent per annum based on our consolidated leverage ratio is payable on the revolving line of credit 
the credit agreement contains covenants  which are customary for similar credit arrangements  and contains financial covenants that require us to have a leverage ratio not exceeding to and a fixed charge coverage ratio defined as the ratio of ebitda less capital expenditures to interest expenses not less than to we do not expect these covenants to materially restrict our ability to borrow funds in the future 
no borrowings were outstanding  and we complied with all covenants under the credit agreement  as of december  in addition  certain international subsidiaries have borrowing arrangements locally outside of the credit agreement discussed above 
as of december  and  there were no borrowings outstanding under such arrangements

we expect that cash and cash equivalents  together with cash flow from operations and availability of borrowings under our current and future sources of financing  will provide liquidity sufficient to meet these needs and for our operations 
off balance sheet arrangements other than the operating lease commitments discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we are not using off balance sheet arrangements  including special purpose entities  nor do we have any contractual obligations or commercial commitments with terms greater than one year that would significantly impact our liquidity

except for the sale leaseback payments recorded in long term liabilities  timing of payments for the vast majority of the remaining long term liabilities  primarily consisting of pension  cannot be reasonably determined and as such have been included in the more than years category 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates to ensure they are consistent with historical experience and the various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and could materially impact our results of operations 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements income tax accruals and valuation allowances 
when preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate the income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax obligations based on expected income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
in the event there is a significant unusual or one time item recognized in the results of operations  the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded in the period the unusual or one time item occurred 
tax law requires certain items to be included in our tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the results of operations 
as a result  the annual effective tax rate reflected in the results of operations is different than that reported on the tax return ie  the cash tax rate 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  and some differences reverse over time  such as depreciation expense 
these timing 
table of contents differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheets 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which the expense has already been recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
we must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some portion of deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance of million has been recorded as of december   resulting in a net deferred tax asset of million 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent items for which a deduction has already been taken in the tax return  but the items have not been recognized as expenses in the results of operations 
significant judgment is required in evaluating tax positions and in determining the provision for income taxes  as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against the net deferred tax assets 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that the tax return positions are fully supportable  certain positions are likely to be challenged and we recognize we may ultimately not prevail in defending those positions 
the reserves are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit 
the effective tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as related interest 
these reserves relate to various tax years subject to audit by taxing authorities 
we believe that the current tax reserves are adequate and reflect the most probable outcome of known tax contingencies 
however  the ultimate outcome may differ from current estimates and assumptions and could impact the provision for income taxes reflected in the consolidated statements of operations 
unfavorable settlement of any particular issue would likely require the use of cash 
favorable resolution could result in reduced income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations in the future 
litigation 
management s current estimated range of liability related to pending litigation is based on claims for which we can estimate the amount or range of loss 
based upon information presently available  management believes that accruals for these claims are adequate 
due to uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation  we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
while these matters could materially affect operating results in future periods depending on the final resolution  it is our opinion that after final disposition  any monetary liability to us beyond that provided in the consolidated balance sheet as of december   would not be material to our financial position 
as additional information becomes available  potential liability related to pending litigation will be assessed and estimates will be revised as necessary 
stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of  and account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  we measure stock based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize the compensation expense over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
we elected the modified prospective method when adopting sfas r  under which prior periods are not retroactively revised 
the valuation provisions of sfas r apply to awards granted after the effective date 
estimated stock based compensation expense for awards granted prior to the effective date but that remain unvested on the effective date will be recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation cost estimated for the sfas pro forma disclosures 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
the black scholes option valuation model requires the development of assumptions that are input into the model 
these variables are the expected stock volatility  the risk free interest rate  the option s expected life and the dividend yield on the underlying stock 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of our stock 
the risk free interest rate for the contractual life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
we use historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination activity within the valuation model 
the expected term of stock options granted is based on historical data and represents the period of time that stock options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the dividend yield is based on the latest dividend payments made on or announced by the date of the grant 
forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience and current demographics 

table of contents developing these assumptions requires us to use significant judgment and involves analyzing available historical data  adjusting historical data for future expectations and appropriately weighting each of the inputs 
these assumptions are evaluated and revised as necessary based on changes in market conditions and historical experience 
goodwill and other intangibles 
we record all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions  including goodwill and other intangibles  at fair value as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill is not amortized but is subject  at a minimum  to annual tests for impairment 
under certain situations  interim impairment tests may be required if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting segment below its carrying amount 
other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method and are subject to impairment if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount 
the initial recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets and subsequent impairment analysis require management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of how the acquired assets will perform in the future using valuation methods including discounted cash flow analysis 
additionally  estimated cash flows may extend for a significant time frame and  by their nature  are difficult to determine 
events and factors that may significantly affect the estimates include  among others  competitive forces  customer behaviors and attrition  changes in revenue growth trends  cost structures  technology  changes in discount rates and specific industry and market conditions 
in determining the reasonableness of cash flow estimates  we review historical performance of the underlying assets or similar assets in an effort to assess and validate assumptions utilized in our estimates 
intangible assets are amortized using methods that approximate the benefit provided by utilization of the assets 
in determining the remaining useful life of a trade name  we consider the following the overall strength of the trade name in the market in terms of market awareness and market share  the length of time that the trade name has been in existence  the period of time over which the trade name is expected to remain in use and the strength of the trade name and its perseverance through changes in the data storage industry 
in assessing the fair value of reporting units  we may consider the stage of the current business cycle and potential changes in market conditions in estimating the timing and extent of future cash flows 
the carrying amount of a reporting unit is determined based on the capital required to support the reporting unit s activities including its tangible and intangible assets 
the determination of a reporting unit s capital allocation requires management judgment and considers many factors including capital characteristics of comparable public companies in relevant industry sectors 
beginning in  the reportable segments were changed to the following americas  europe and asia pacific 
as a result  we reallocated goodwill to these reportable segments 
we completed our annual impairment review of goodwill during the fourth quarter of and noted no impairment of goodwill 
excess inventory and obsolescence accruals 
we write down our inventory for estimated excess and obsolescence to the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we project  adjustments to these reserves may be required 
as of december   the excess inventory and obsolescence accrual was million 
rebates 
we maintain an accrual for customer rebates that totaled million as of december  this accrual requires a program by program estimation of outcomes based on a variety of factors including customer unit sell through volumes and end user redemption rates 
in the event that actual volumes and redemption rates differ from the estimates used in the accrual calculation  adjustments to the accrual  upward or downward  may be necessary 
other accrued liabilities 
we also have other accrued liabilities  including uninsured claims and pensions 
these accruals are based on a variety of factors including past experience and various actuarial assumptions and  in many cases  require estimates of events not yet reported to us 
if future experience differs from these estimates  operating results in future periods would be impacted 
we sponsor defined benefit pension plans in both us and foreign entities 
expenses and liabilities for the pension plans are actuarially calculated 
these calculations are based on our assumptions related to the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and projected salary increases 
the annual measurement date for these assumptions is december note to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosures of these assumptions for both the us and international plans 

table of contents the discount rate assumptions are tied to portfolios of long term high quality bonds and are  therefore  subject to annual fluctuations 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of the pension obligations  which results in higher pension expense 
the discount rate used in calculating the benefit obligation in the us was percent at december   as compared to percent at december  a discount rate reduction of percent increases us pension plan expense pre tax by approximately million 
the expected return on assets assumptions on the investment portfolios for the pension plans are based on the long term expected returns for the investment mix of assets currently in the respective portfolio 
because the rate of return is a long term assumption  it generally does not change each year 
we use historic return trends of the asset portfolio combined with recent market conditions to estimate the future rate of return 
the rate of return used in calculating the pension expense for  and was percent 
a change of percent for the expected return on plan assets assumption will impact us net pension plan expense pre tax by approximately million 
expected returns on asset assumptions for non us plans are determined in a manner consistent with the us plan 
the projected salary increase assumption is based on historic trends and comparisons to the external market 
higher rates of increase result in higher pension expenses 
in the united states  we have used the rate of percent for the past three years 
mortality assumptions were obtained from the group mortality table 
recently issued accounting standards in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks including volatility in foreign currency exchange rates  commodity price changes and credit risk 
international operations  which comprised approximately percent of our revenue in  may be subject to various risks that are not present in domestic operations 
the additional risks include political instability  the possibility of expropriation  restrictions on royalties  dividends and currency remittances  requirements for governmental approvals for new ventures and local participation in operations such as local equity ownership and workers councils 
our foreign currency hedging policy attempts to manage some of the foreign currency risks over near term periods  however  we cannot ensure that these risk management activities will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates or that medium and longer term effects of exchange rates will not be significant 
although we attempt to utilize hedging to manage the impact of changes in currency exchange rates  when the us dollar sustains a strengthening position against currencies in which we sell products or a weakening exchange rate against currencies in which we incur costs  our revenue or costs are adversely impacted 

table of contents in accordance with established policies and procedures  we may utilize derivative financial instruments  including forward exchange contracts  options and swap agreements to manage certain of these exposures 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of our hedging include the accuracy of our forecasts  the volatility of the currency markets and the availability of hedging instruments 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and we are not a party to leveraged derivative transactions 
the utilization of derivatives and hedging activities is described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we had million notional amount of foreign currency forward and option contracts of which million hedged recorded balance sheet exposures 
this compares to million notional amount of foreign currency forward and option contracts as of december   of which million hedged recorded balance sheet exposures 
an immediate adverse change of percent in year end foreign currency exchange rates with all other variables including interest rates held constant would reduce the fair value of foreign currency contracts outstanding as of december  by million 
our exposure to commodity price changes relates primarily to certain manufacturing operations that utilize aluminum ingot and petroleum based products 
we manage our exposure to changes in these prices through our procurement and sales practices 
significant unexpected increases in the price of or decreases in the supply of these products could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results 
we are exposed to credit risk associated with cash investments and foreign currency derivatives 
we do not believe that our cash investments and foreign currency derivatives present significant credit risks because the counterparties to the instruments consist of major financial institutions and we monitor and manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with each counterparty
