item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business outlook as we begin fiscal year  we continue to see weak overall demand for apparel at retail 
despite this macro trend  we are encouraged by the demand for products from our retail ready segment 
our junkfood business experienced strong growth in our fiscal fourth quarter and our current indications are that this will continue into the first part of fiscal we believe this growth is due  to some extent  from retailers looking for new  fresh product to stimulate the consumer 
junkfood also has new licenses and customer opportunities that should allow us to build on the sales momentum established in the second half of fiscal our soffe business had record revenue for fiscal  although fourth quarter sales were below our expectations 
we are seeing good sell through of soffe products and expect to further grow this business in fiscal year in all channels of distribution 

table of contents while we will be somewhat capacity constrained in our activewear segment during the first half of fiscal year  we also expect record sales in this business for the year due primarily to having a full year of funtees revenue 
as our new lower cost production comes on stream in the second half of the year we expect to have more products to fully participate in the marketplace 
we believe demand for our off shore decorating capabilities will be strong and we should be able to build private label business over the long term 
over the past years  we have used the cash flow from our activewear segment to fund acquisitions to build our retail ready segment 
in fiscal year  we began reinvesting in our activewear segment with the acquisition of funtees and the construction of ceiba textiles  our offshore textile facility in honduras 
with the recent passage of cafta  we believe it is important for us to take advantage of the opportunity to lower our fabric cost on basic products 
the building and utility infrastructure will be leased from the green valley industrial park 
we expect our total capital expenditure for this project will be approximately million 
the facility is expected to ultimately produce approximately one million pounds of fabric per week and is expected to reduce our cost by approximately million annually once at full production levels 
the funtees and ceiba textiles initiatives are expected to be key drivers in the future growth of our activewear segment 
in july  we announced our plans to restructure our us textile operations by closing our manufacturing facility in fayette  alabama 
the closing of this facility is expected to occur in our first quarter of fiscal year and will leave us with two us textile operations  one located in maiden  north carolina and the other in fayetteville  north carolina 
in conjunction with our overall textile initiatives  including the integration of funtees into our maiden  north carolina facility  the opening of our honduran textile facility  and the closing of our fayette  alabama facility  we expect to incur total costs of approximately million  or per diluted share  associated with the restructuring 
the expenses impacted our fourth quarter of fiscal  and are expected to impact our first half of fiscal year  as follows fy qtr fy qtr fy qtr total cost of sales million million million million restructuring charges million million million total million million million million diluted eps impact we expect our restructuring initiatives will result in costs savings per diluted share of approximately in fiscal year  in fiscal year  and in fiscal year earnings guidance for the first fiscal quarter ending september   we expect sales to be in the range of to million and diluted per share results to be in the range of to 
this compares to our fiscal year first quarter sales of million and diluted earnings of per share 
for the fiscal year ending june   we expect sales to be in the range of to million and diluted earnings per share to be in the range of to 
this includes the million  or per diluted share  of anticipated expenses associated with the start up of the new honduran textile facility and the shutdown of the fayette  alabama facility that will impact results in the first two quarters of fiscal year this compares to our fiscal year sales of million and diluted earnings of per share 
results of operations overview for the fiscal year  sales reached an all time record of million  a increase from million in sales in the prior year as the funtees acquisition provided significant additional sales in our private label business in the activewear segment  partially offset by sales declines in our catalog business in the activewear segment 
gross margins for the year decreased basis points to compared to in the prior year driven primarily from excess manufacturing and startup costs of million associated with the integration of the funtees operations into our existing maiden  north carolina facility 
in addition  the inclusion of funtees also reduced overall gross margins as sales from its private label business carry lower margins than our branded business  and the junkfood business  which carries higher margins  had lower sales than in the prior year 

table of contents net income for the year ended june  was million  a decrease from the prior year  due primarily to lower gross margins described above  restructuring charges including million for impairment charges related to the us textile operations restructuring and higher interest charges on the debt incurred for the fun tees acquisition 
earnings were per basic share and per diluted share  including the per diluted share of restructuring related charges  compared to per basic share and per diluted share in the prior year 
we ended fiscal year with million in total receivables  a decrease of million from the prior year  primarily due to our improved days sales outstanding  which ended the year at days compared to days at the end of fiscal year our inventories on june  were million  an increase of million from the prior year  primarily due to the funtees acquisition 
we believe our year end inventory levels are appropriate to support our sales growth expectations for the fiscal first quarter and full fiscal year 
additionally  our accounts payable balance at june  was million  an increase of million from the prior year  primarily due to the funtees acquisition 
we reduced our debt levels by million during the fourth quarter  ending the year with million in total debt 
we had million of availability under our revolving credit facility at year end

in the delta catalog business  unit volume declined from the prior year by lower volumes in the basic t shirt products  which were partially offset by average selling prices improving by 
higher average selling prices contributed million in revenue while reduced unit volumes had a negative impact of million

the margin decline of basis points was primarily the result of the restructuring charges of million from the expensing of start up and excess manufacturing costs associated with the integration of funtees into our existing facility in maiden  nc 
the retail ready segment had flat gross margins from the prior year 
the addition of funtees reduced our overall gross margins in fiscal year as sales from its private label business generally carry lower gross margins than our branded business 
our gross margins may not be comparable to other companies  since some companies include costs related to their distribution network in cost of goods sold and we exclude a portion of them from gross margin and include them in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year were million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales  for fiscal year the increase of million in additional expenses is due primarily from the addition of the funtees business 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales declined basis points due to the lower costs associated with the funtees business and lower management incentive expenses

table of contents net interest expense for fiscal year was million  an increase of million  or  from million for fiscal year the increase in interest expense was primarily due to the higher debt levels resulting from the acquisition of funtees 
interest rates also increased during fiscal year from fiscal year by approximately basis points  contributing to the higher interest expense 
our effective income tax rate for fiscal year was  compared to for fiscal year our effective income tax rate for fiscal year is lower than for fiscal year primarily as a result of the donation of our old knoxville  tennessee distribution facility to a charitable organization 
from this donation  we recognized a million tax benefit 
in addition  due to our lower earnings this year  a higher proportion of our earnings are in the tax free zone of honduras  driving a lower overall effective tax rate

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to the adequacy of receivable and inventory reserves  self insurance accruals and the accounting for income taxes 
note to our consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  title has transferred to the customer  the price is fixed and determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured 
the majority of our sales are shipped fob shipping point and revenue is therefore recognized when the goods are shipped to the customer 
for the sales that are shipped fob destination point  we do not recognize the revenue until the goods are received by the customer 
sales are recorded net of discounts and provisions for estimated returns and allowances 
we estimate returns and allowances on an ongoing basis by considering historical and current trends 
we record these costs as a reduction to net revenue 
we estimate the net collectibility of our accounts receivable and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon this assessment 
specifically  we analyze the aging of accounts receivable balances  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
significant changes in customer concentration or payment terms  deterioration of customer credit worthiness or weakening in economic trends could have a significant impact on the collectibility of receivables and our operating results 
inventories our inventory is carried at the lower of fifo cost or market 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for damaged  excess and out of style or otherwise obsolete inventory based primarily on our historical selling prices for these products and our estimated forecast of product demand for the next twelve months 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  or if liquidation of the inventory is more difficult than anticipated  additional inventory write downs may be required 
self insurance our medical  prescription and dental care benefits are primarily self insured 
our self insurance accruals are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported 
we develop estimates of claims incurred but not reported based upon the historical time it takes for a claim to be reported and historical claim amounts 
while the time it takes for a claim to be reported has been declining  if claims are greater than we originally estimate  or if costs increase beyond what we have anticipated  our recorded reserves may not be sufficient  and it could have a significant impact on our operating results 
we had self insurance reserves of approximately  and  for june  and july   respectively 
share based compensation we adopted the fair value based method prescribed in statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  effective july  under the fair value based method  compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the award vesting period 
we determine the fair value of each stock option at the date of grant using the black scholes options pricing model 
this model requires that we estimate a 
table of contents risk free interest rate  the volatility of the price of our common stock  the dividend yield  and the expected life of the options 
the use of a different estimate for any one of these components could have a material impact on the amount of calculated compensation expense 
income taxes we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes  which requires recognition of temporary differences between financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities measured by enacted tax rates 
we have recorded deferred tax assets for certain state operating loss carryforwards and nondeductible accruals 
we established a valuation allowance related to certain of the state operating loss carryforward amounts in accordance with the provisions of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we continually review the adequacy of the valuation allowance and recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets if reassessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized based on earnings forecasts in the respective tax locations 
we had operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million for state tax purposes and a related valuation allowance against the operating loss carryfowards of thousand and thousand at june  and july   respectively 
these carryforwards expire at various intervals through recent accounting standards in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments an amendment of fasb statements no 
and sfas 
sfas permits an entity to measure at fair value any financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would be required to be bifurcated and accounted for separately under fasb statement no 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after september  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas will have on our financial position and results of operations and do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes interpretation 
interpretation provides clarifying guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes and prescribes recognition and measurement guidance in determining amounts to be recorded in the financial statements 
this interpretation applies to all income based tax items and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption will have on our financial position and results of operations and do not expect that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in september  the staff of the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of determining whether the current year s financial statements are materially misstated

 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas  which permits companies to choose to measure certain financial instruments and certain other items at fair value

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk sensitivity on january   in conjunction with the sale of our yarn spinning facility in edgefield  south carolina  we entered into a five year agreement with parkdale to supply our yarn requirements 
during this five year period  we will purchase from parkdale all yarn required by delta apparel and our wholly owned subsidiaries for use in our manufacturing operations excluding yarns that parkdale did not manufacture as of the date of the agreement in the ordinary course of its business or due to temporary parkdale capacity restraints 
the purchase price of yarn is based upon the cost of cotton plus a fixed conversion cost 
thus  we are subject to the commodity risk of cotton prices and cotton price movements which could result 
table of contents in unfavorable yarn pricing for us 
we set future cotton prices with purchase commitments as a component of the purchase price of yarn in advance of the shipment of finished yarn from parkdale 
prices are set according to prevailing prices  as reported by the new york cotton exchange  at the time we enter into the commitments 
yarn with respect to which we have fixed cotton prices at june  was valued at million  and is scheduled for delivery between july and december at june   a decline in the market price of the cotton covered by our fixed price yarn would have had a negative impact of approximately million on the value of the yarn 
this compares to a negative impact of million at the fiscal year end based on the yarn with fixed cotton prices at july  the effect of a decline in the market price of covered cotton had a larger impact as of july  than as of june  due to the higher levels of fixed cotton outstanding on july  we may use derivatives  including cotton option contracts  to manage our exposure to movements in commodity prices 
we do not designate our options as hedge instruments upon inception 
accordingly  we mark to market changes in the fair market value of the options as other income or other expense in the statements of income 
we did not own any cotton options contracts on june  or july  interest rate sensitivity our credit agreements provide that the outstanding amounts owed shall bear interest at variable rates 
if the amount of outstanding indebtedness at june  under the revolving credit facilities had been outstanding during the entire year and the interest rate on this outstanding indebtedness was increased by basis points  our expense would have increased by approximately million  or  for the fiscal year 
this compares to an increase of million  or  for the fiscal year based on the outstanding indebtedness at july  the effect of a basis point increase in interest rates has a larger impact as of june  than as of july  due to the higher debt levels outstanding on june   resulting primarily from the acquisition of the funtees business 
the actual increase in interest expense resulting from a change in interest rates would depend on the magnitude of the increase in rates and the average principal balance outstanding 
derivatives on april   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement and interest rate collar agreement to manage our interest rate exposure and effectively reduce the impact of future interest changes 
both agreements mature or expire on april  by entering into the interest rate swap agreement  we effectively converted million of floating rate debt under our credit facility to a fixed obligation with a libor rate at 
by entering into the interest rate collar agreement  we effectively provided a cap of and a floor of on libor rates on million of floating rate debt under our credit facility 
we have assessed these agreements and elected to account for each as a hedge 
changes in the derivatives fair values are deferred and recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci until the underlying transaction is recorded 
when the hedged item affects income  gains or losses are reclassified from aoci to the consolidated statements of income as interest income expense 
any ineffectiveness  if material  in the company s hedging relationships is recognized immediately in the statement of income 
the changes in fair value of the interest rate swap and collar agreement resulted in aoci  net of taxes  of million for the year ended june  there were no outstanding derivative instruments at july  or july
