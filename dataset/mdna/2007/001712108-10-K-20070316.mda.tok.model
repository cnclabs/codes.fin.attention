from time to time  in the normal course of business  we are involved with disputes and have various claims made against us 
there are no material proceedings to which we are a party currently pending  and management is unaware of any material contemplated actions against us 
in connection with the asset purchase agreement  relating to the sale of the medical division  each party has indemnified the other with respect to specified liabilities and breaches of certain representations and warranties 
until january  we cannot  except in certain limited situations  compete with the medical division  and we cannot induce a medical division customer or prospect to terminate its relationship with cerner 
in addition  until january  we cannot directly or indirectly attempt to induce any former medical division employee to work for us  and we are prohibited from hiring certain specified former medical division employees 
as permitted under delaware law  we have agreements under which we indemnify our executive officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is or was serving at our request in such capacity 
the term of the indemnification period is for the officer s or director s lifetime 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have a director and officer insurance policy that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
given the insurance coverage in effect  we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal 
we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of december  we generally include intellectual property indemnification provisions in our software license agreements 
pursuant to these provisions  we hold harmless and agree to defend the indemnified party  generally our business partners and customers  in connection with certain patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret infringement claims by third parties with respect to our products 
the term of the indemnification provisions varies and may be perpetual 
in the event an infringement claim against us or an indemnified party is made  generally we  in our sole discretion  agree to do one of the following i procure for the indemnified party the right to continue use of the software  ii provide a modification to the software so that its use becomes noninfringing  iii replace the software with software which is substantially similar in functionality and performance  or iv refund all or the residual value of the software license fees paid by the indemnified party for the infringing software 
we believe the estimated fair 
table of contents value of these intellectual property indemnification agreements is minimal 
we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of december  critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements and accompanying notes  which we believe have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  assumptions and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for future returns  discounts and bad debts  tangible and intangible assets  deferred costs  income taxes  restructurings  commitments  contingencies  claims and litigation 
we base our judgments and estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
however  our actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop with respect to certain transactions  sop accounting for performance of construction type and certain performance type contracts and the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements sab and eitf  income statement characterization of reimbursements for out of pocket expenses incurred 
we recognize software license revenues and system computer hardware sales upon execution of the sales contract and delivery of the software off the shelf application software and or hardware 
in all cases  however  the fee must be fixed or determinable  collection of any related receivable must be considered probable  and no significant post contract obligations of ours shall be remaining 
otherwise  we defer the sale until all of the requirements for revenue recognition have been satisfied 
maintenance fees for routine client support and unspecified product updates are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance arrangement 
training  implementation and edi services revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
in instances that the company believes that services are essential to the functionality of the product the company recognizes revenue under the provisions of sop most of our sales and licensing contracts involve multiple elements  in which case  we allocate the total value of the customer arrangement to each element based on the vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value of the respective elements 
the residual method is used to determine revenue recognition with respect to a multiple element arrangement when vsoe of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements eg  implementation  training and maintenance services  but does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements of the contract eg  computer software or hardware 
vsoe of fair value is determined based upon the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
if vsoe of fair value cannot be established for the undelivered element s of an arrangement  the total value of the customer arrangement is deferred until the undelivered element s is delivered or until vsoe of fair value is established 
in our contracts and arrangements with our customers  we generally do not include acceptance provisions  which would give the customer the right to accept or reject the product after we ship it 
however  if an acceptance provision is included  revenue is recognized upon the customer s acceptance of the product  which occurs upon the earlier receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
recognition of revenues in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments that affect the timing and amount of reported revenues 
cash equivalents and marketable debt securities 
cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds and are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value  which approximates cost 
marketable debt securities consist of high quality debt instruments  primarily us government  municipal and corporate obligations 
investments in corporate obligations are classified as held to maturity  as amicas has the intent and ability to hold them to maturity 
held to maturity marketable debt securities are reported at amortized cost 
investments in municipal obligations are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as other comprehensive income 
marketable debt securities include 
table of contents held to maturity investments with remaining maturities of less than one year as of the balance sheet date and available for sale investments that may be sold in the current period or used in current operations 
accounts receivable 
our accounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal trade terms carried at their face value  less provisions for bad debts 
we evaluate the carrying amount of our accounts receivable on an ongoing basis and establish a valuation allowance based on a number of factors  including specific customer circumstances  historical rate of write offs and the past due status of the accounts 
at the end of each reporting period  the allowance is reviewed and analyzed for adequacy and is often adjusted based on the findings 
the allowance is increased through an increase in bad debt expense 
long lived assets 
we review our long lived assets  such as property and equipment  and purchased intangible assets that are subject to amortization  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company periodically reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of those assets are no longer appropriate 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flows to the recorded carrying value for the asset 
if impairment is indicated  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
goodwill and business combinations 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired 
we are required to test our goodwill for impairment of value on at least an annual basis 
to date  the results of our tests have not revealed an impairment of value 
software development costs 
we begin capitalizing software development costs  exclusively third party programmer fees  only after establishing commercial and technical viability 
annual amortization of these costs represents the greater of the amount computed using i the ratio that current gross revenues for the product s bear to the total current and anticipated future gross revenues of the product s  or ii the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product s  generally  depending on the nature and success of the product  such deferred costs are amortized over a three to five year period 
amortization commences when the product is made commercially available 
no products were made commercially available in  or in we evaluate the recoverability of capitalized software based on estimated future gross revenues less the estimated cost of completing the products and of performing maintenance and product support 
if our gross revenues turn out to be significantly less than our estimates  the net realizable value of our capitalized software intended for sale would be impaired 
as discussed above in results of operations  we recognized impairment charges in relating to our capitalized software costs 
income taxes 
we provide for taxes based on current taxable income  and the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax carrying values of our assets and liabilities deferred income taxes 
at each reporting period  management assesses the realizable value of deferred tax assets based on  among other things  estimates of future taxable income  and adjusts the related valuation allowance as necessary 
accounting for share based payment 
we account for share based payments in accordance with sfas r  share based payment 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating expected dividends  share price volatility and the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  share based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
loss contingencies 
we are subject to legal proceedings  lawsuits and other claims relating to labor  service and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business 
quarterly  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an 
table of contents exposure is reasonably estimable 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
recent accounting pronouncements in june   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement fin 
this statement clarifies the criteria that an individual tax position must satisfy for some or all of the benefits of that position to be recognized in a company s financial statements 
fin prescribes recognition threshold of more likely than not  and a measurement attribute for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  in order to be recognized in the financial statements 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  accordingly  the company will adopt fin on january  the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of fin will be reported as an adjustment of the company s opening balance of retained earnings or other appropriate components of equity or net assets in the statement of financial position 
the company is in the process of assessing the impact of this interpretation and currently estimates that the application of this standard will not result in a material adjustment 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the standard applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
the standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas will have on its financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe we are not subject to material foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  as most of our sales and expenses are domestic and therefore are denominated in the us dollar 
we do not hold derivative securities and have not entered into contracts embedded with derivative instruments  such as foreign currency and interest rate swaps  options  forwards  futures  collars  and warrants  either to hedge existing risks or for speculative purposes
