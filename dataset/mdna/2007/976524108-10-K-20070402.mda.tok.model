critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses for each period 
the following represents a summary of the company s critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that the company believes are a the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and b that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
estimates and assumptions are made by management to assess the overall likelihood that an accounting estimate or assumption may require adjustment 
management assumptions have been reasonably accurate in the past  and future estimates or assumptions are likely to be calculated on the same basis 
in december  the fasb issued a revision of sfas no 
share based payment no 
r 
the statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services 
it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
the statement does not change the accounting guidance for share based payments with parties other than employees 
the statement requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee service received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exception 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award usually the vesting period 
the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of these instruments 
this new accounting standard  which was implemented during  utilized the modified expected approach 
the company believes this standard will not have a material effect on its financial position and results of operations see note 
due to the company s limited history with respect to forfeiters of incentive stock options  there is no estimate of expired or canceled options included in the option valuation 
revenue from product sales  net of trade discounts and allowances  is recognized once delivery has occurred provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer 
sales to international distributors are recognized in the same manner 
raw material inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
finished goods and work in process are valued at average cost of production  which includes material  labor and manufacturing expenses 
comprehensive income represents changes in equity during a period  except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners 
during the fiscal years ended december  and  the components of other comprehensive income loss were the adjustments for employee benefit obligations and foreign currency translation gains and losses necessary to adopt sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
a key consideration in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts has been  and will continue to be  our customer s payment history and aging of its accounts receivable balance 
for example  each additional allowance required on our accounts receivable would reduce our income by approximately  income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
the process incorporates an assessment of the current tax exposure together with temporary differences resulting from different treatment of transactions for tax and financial statement purposes 
such differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
the recovery of deferred tax assets from future taxable income must be assessed and  to the extent that recovery is not likely  the company establishes a valuation allowance 
increases in valuation allowances result in the recording of additional tax expense 
further  if the ultimate tax liability differs from the periodic tax provision reflected in the consolidated statements of operations  additional tax expense may be recorded 
our deferred tax asset at december   aggregates approximately  we must continue to be profitable in order to be able to utilize this asset in future periods 
valuation of long lived assets the company assesses the potential impairment of long lived tangible and intangible assets  subject to amortization  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
these assets  other than goodwill  are reviewed for impairment not less than annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of any such asset may be impaired 
the company s management evaluates the recoverability of such assets by estimating future cash flows 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows  expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition  is less than the carrying amount of the assets  management will recognize an impairment loss to the extent of the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over the fair value of the assets 
sfas no 
requires that the company perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired on an annual basis unless events or circumstances warrant a more frequent assessment 
the impairment assessment involves  among other things  an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit based on the discounted cash flow methodology 
significant assumptions used in our analysis include annual revenue growth rate from to and a discount rate of approximately 
if the assessment indicates that the fair value is less than the carrying value  then the goodwill would be subject to an impairment loss adjustment 
if the impairment review of goodwill  intangible assets subject to amortization  and other long lived assets differ significantly from actual results  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
for example  a impairment adjustment on goodwill and other intangibles would reduce income by approximately  and  respectively

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s bank loan and the associated interest expense are not sensitive to changes in the level of interest rates 
the company s note is interest free through june and will bear interest at the annual rate of beginning july the note requires twelve half yearly payments beginning december until maturity at june as a result  the company is not subject to market risk for changes in interest rates and will not be subjected to increased or decreased interest payments if market rates fluctuate and the company is in a borrowing mode 
foreign exchange rate risk the company has one foreign subsidiary in germany 
the company does business in more than fifty countries and currently generates approximately of its revenues from outside north america
