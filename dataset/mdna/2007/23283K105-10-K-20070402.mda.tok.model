overview regenerative cell technology cytori is developing its celution system  an innovative medical device that removes a patient s own stem and regenerative cells from their fat tissue so that these cells can be delivered to the same patient in about an hour 
the commercialization model will be based on the sale of the system and related single use therapeutic sets that are tailored to each therapeutic application 
we are focused initially on bringing applications to market for reconstructive surgery and cardiovascular disease 
success is dependent on conducting well designed clinical trials that demonstrate patient benefit and support reimbursement and physician adoption  gaining regulatory clearance for the celution system  and building out our commercialization and manufacturing infrastructure 
the celution system may potentially be applied to other important therapeutic areas  which include gastrointestinal disorders  peripheral vascular disease  spinal disc repair  and urinary incontinence 
for this reason  a significant part of our strategy is to seek commercialization partnerships with medical device or pharmaceutical companies that possess development expertise and have sales forces dedicated to specific therapeutic areas 
the goal is to broaden the number of applications for which the celution system may be sold  accelerate the development of applications outside of our core expertise and to bring in capital through partnering agreements that will offset the development of reconstructive surgery and cardiovascular disease applications 
breast reconstruction we made significant progress in toward commercializing the celution system in europe in early for reconstructive surgery 
through placement of a celution system in a patient investigator initiated breast reconstruction clinical study in japan  we gained substantial knowledge on how to optimize use of the device in a hospital setting and we learned from preliminary observations that adipose stem and regenerative cells are safe in this indication 
in  we will initiate a larger company sponsored clinical study to evaluate efficacy in breast reconstruction following partial mastectomy 
in parallel  we will build out our manufacturing capabilities and enter into european distribution agreements 
starting in late  we expect that the olympus cytori joint venture  described below  will assume device manufacturing  and in that same time frame we expect to announce results from our breast reconstruction trial in europe and thus anticipate increased product demand 
currently  there are few if any options available to patients who undergo a partial mastectomy and desire a breast reconstruction 
in europe  there are  patients diagnosed with breast cancer each year and an estimated are considered eligible for a partial mastectomy 
approximately million women in europe already have breast cancer 
in the united states   are diagnosed each year with breast cancer and million are estimated to already have the condition 
during  cytori plans to begin preparing and designing breast reconstruction clinical trials to begin in the united states in 
table of contents cardiovascular disease over the past three years  a significant percentage of our research and development has been dedicated to performing several cardiovascular disease pre clinical studies and analysis to demonstrate safety  efficacy  expand our understanding of mechanisms and distribution in order to optimize delivery techniques 
this has resulted in a compilation of extensive pre clinical data to support the initiation of human clinical trials  which was the highest development priority during based on these results  we started a clinical trial for chronic ischemia in january it is a patient safety and feasibility study evaluating adipose stem and regenerative cells as a treatment for chronic ischemia 
the patients cells are extracted from their adipose tissue using the celution system then injected into the injured oxygen deprived areas of their hearts through a specially designed catheter 
the patients will be evaluated for six months after treatment 
the study is being conducted at gregorio mara n hospital in madrid spain and led by drs 
francisco j 
fern ndez avil s and emerson perin 
enrollment for this trial remains on track and full results are expected to be reported in the fourth quarter of we expect to start a clinical trial in heart attack patients in the second quarter of this trial will be a patient safety and feasibility study to evaluate adipose stem and regenerative cells as a treatment for heart attacks 
the cells are extracted from their adipose tissue using the celution system and injected into their coronary artery 
the patients will be evaluated six months after treatment 
full results are expected to be reported in the study is being conducted at thoraxcenter  erasmus medical center hospital in rotterdam  the netherlands and led by dr 
patrick serruys 
preparations for initiating this trial remain on schedule and results are expected to be reported in the fourth quarter of the american heart association estimates that in the united states alone  there are approximately million heart attacks each year and more than million people suffer from a form of chronic heart disease 
given the size of this market and the pre clinical data demonstrating functional improvement  cardiovascular disease represents a very important application for our celution system and we believe that outcome of the clinical data from these safety and feasibility studies could have a significant impact on our future operations 
olympus partnership on november   we entered into a strategic development and manufacturing joint venture agreement and other related agreements jv agreements with olympus corporation olympus 
as part of the terms of the jv agreements  we formed a joint venture  olympus cytori  inc the joint venture  to develop and manufacture future generation devices based on our celution system 
under the joint venture agreements olympus paid  for its interest in the joint venture 
moreover  olympus simultaneously entered into a license joint development agreement with the joint venture and us to develop a second generation commercial system and manufacturing capabilities 
we licensed our device technology  including the celution system and certain related intellectual property  to the joint venture for use in future generation devices 
these devices will process and purify adult stem and regenerative cells residing in adipose fat tissue for various therapeutic clinical applications 
in exchange for this license  we received a interest in the joint venture  as well as an initial  payment from the joint venture  the source of this payment was the  contributed to the joint venture by olympus 
moreover  upon receipt of a ce mark for the first generation celution system in january  we received an additional  development milestone payment from the joint venture 
put calls and guarantees the shareholders agreement between cytori and olympus provides that in certain specified circumstances of insolvency or if we experience a change in control  olympus will have the rights to i repurchase our interests in the joint venture at the fair value of such interests or ii sell its own interests in the joint venture to cytori at the higher of a  or b the put s fair value 
as of november   the fair value of the put was determined to be  at december  and  the fair value of the put was  and  respectively 
fluctuations in the put value are recorded in the statements of operations as a component of change in fair value of option liabilities 
the put value itself  which is perpetual  has been recorded as a long term liability on the balance sheet in the caption option liabilities 

table of contents the following assumptions were employed in estimating the value of the put december  december  november  expected volatility of cytori expected volatility of the joint venture bankruptcy recovery rate for cytori bankruptcy threshold for cytori probability of a change of control event for cytori expected correlation between fair values of cytori and the joint venture in the future risk free interest rate the put has no expiration date 
accordingly  we will continue to recognize a liability for the put and mark it to market each quarter until it is exercised or until the arrangements with olympus are amended 
the joint venture has exclusive access to our technology for the development  manufacture  and supply of the devices second generation and beyond for all therapeutic applications 
once a second generation celution system is developed and approved by regulatory agencies  the joint venture would sell such systems exclusively to us at a formula based transfer price  we have retained marketing rights to the second generation devices for all therapeutic applications of adipose stem and regenerative cells 
in  cytori worked closely with olympus team of scientists and engineers to design future generations of the celution system that contain certain product enhancements and that can be manufactured in a streamlined manner 
for  the joint venture will continue its efforts with the goal of scale up manufacturing available in late other related party transactions as part of the formation of the joint venture and as discussed above  the joint venture agreed to purchase development services from olympus 
in december  the joint venture paid to olympus  as a payment for those services 
the payment has been recognized in its entirety as an expense on the books and records of the joint venture as the expenditure represents a payment for research and development services that have no alternative future uses 
our share of this expense has been reflected within the account  equity loss from investment in joint venture  within the consolidated statement of operations 
in a separate agreement entered into on february   we granted olympus an exclusive right to negotiate commercialization collaboration for the use of adipose stem and regenerative cells for a specific therapeutic area outside of cardiovascular disease 
in exchange for this right  we received a million payment from olympus 
as part of this agreement  olympus will conduct market research and pilot clinical studies in collaboration with us over a to month period for the therapeutic area 
macropore biosurgery spine and orthopedic products we manufacture bioresorbable implants used in spine and orthopedic procedures 
medtronic is the sole distributor of our products but due to a substantial decrease in their orders of this product  we experienced negative profit margins for our macropore biosurgery segment for the year ended december  and are actively pursuing a buyer or buyers for this line of business 
thin film japan distribution agreement in  we sold the majority of our thin film business to mast 
even after consummation of the thin film asset sale to mast  we retained all rights to thin film business in japan subject to a purchase option of mast  as described later below  and we received back from mast a license of all rights to thin film technologies in the spinal field  exclusive at least until  and field of regenerative medicine  non exclusive on a perpetual basis 

table of contents in the third quarter of  we entered into a distribution agreement with senko 
under this agreement  we granted to senko an exclusive license to sell and distribute certain thin film products in japan 
specifically  the license covers thin film products with the following indications anti adhesion  soft tissue support  and minimization of the attachment of soft tissues throughout the body 
the distribution agreement with senko commences upon commercialization 
in simplest terms  commercialization occurs when one or more thin film product registrations are completed with the japanese ministry of health  labour and welfare mhlw 
following commercialization  the distribution agreement has a duration of five years and is renewable for an additional five years after reaching mutually agreed minimum purchase guarantees 
we received a  upfront license fee from senko 
we have recorded the  received as a component of deferred revenues in the accompanying balance sheet 
half of the license fee is refundable if the parties agree commercialization is not achievable and a proportional amount is refundable if we terminate the arrangement  other than for material breach by senko  before three years post commercialization 
under the distribution agreement  we will also be entitled to earn additional payments from senko based on achieving defined milestones 
on september   we notified senko of completion of the initial regulatory application to the mhlw for the thin film product 
as a result  we became entitled to a nonrefundable payment of  which we received in october and recorded as a component of deferred revenues 
to date we have recognized a total of  in development revenues   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the previously mentioned sale agreement granted mast a purchase right to acquire  at any time before may   our thin film related interests and rights for japan 
if mast chooses to exercise the purchase right between now and may   the exercise price of the purchase right will be equal to the fair market value of the japanese business  but in no event will be less than  moreover  until may   mast has a right of first refusal to match the terms of any outside offer to buy our japanese thin film business 
capital requirements and liquidity research and development for the celution system and clinical applications of adipose derived stem and regenerative cell therapies has been and will continue to be very costly 
we anticipate expanding our research and development expenses to fund clinical trials costs which we will be initiating for the first time in  pre clinical research  and general and administrative activities 
as a result  we expect to continue incurring losses for the foreseeable future 
over of our research and development expenses of  were related to our regenerative cell technology business  and the majority of those were related to research and development of applications of adipose stem and regenerative cells for cardiovascular disease 
we believe our research and development expenses will continue to increase should we advance more products into and through clinical trials and as we prepare for a commercial launch 
we plan to fund this anticipated research and development from the following existing cash and short term investments  potential future financings  payments  if any  related to potential celution system commercialization partnerships or stem cell banking licensing agreements payments  if any  related to potential biomaterial product line divestitures  and potential research grants as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments on hand of  and an accumulated deficit of  on february   we completed a registered direct public offering of units consisting of common stock and warrants  which raised approximately  after expenses 
on march   we entered into an agreement to sell  shares of common stock at per share to green hospital supply  inc in a private placement 

table of contents results of operations product revenues product revenues relate entirely to our macropore biosurgery segment and include revenues from our spine and orthopedic products  thin film products and cmf products 
the following table summarizes the components for the years ended december   and years ended differences differences to to to to product revenues spine and orthopedics products thin film products product sales non mast related product sales to mast amortization of gain on sale mast cmf products product sales amortization of gain on sale total product revenues attributable to medtronic macropore biosurgery spine and orthopedic product revenues represent sales of bioresorbable implants used in spine and orthopedic surgical procedures 
for the years ended december  and  these revenues were primarily related to orders for our radiographically identifiable spine system products  marketed under the name mystique  which medtronic  our sole distributor of spine and orthopedic products  launched in the third quarter of however  subsequent to the initial product launch  medtronic has substantially decreased its orders of this product  and we are concerned about medtronic s ongoing level of commitment to this product 
as a result of this decrease  we experienced negative profit margins for our macropore biosurgery segment for the year ended december  as a result  we are actively seeking a buyer or buyers for this line of business 
medtronic owned approximately of our outstanding common stock as of december  after our february  stock issuance 
thin film product revenues in represent sales of surgiwrap bioresorbable thin film 
we sold most  but not all  of our intellectual property rights and tangible assets related to our thin film product line to mast biosurgery in the second quarter of we were obliged by contract to act as a back up supplier for these products and to sell them to mast at our manufacturing costs 
however  as mast assumed the manufacturing process  domestic revenue from thin film products ended in no revenues from the thin film product line were recognized during the years ended december  and we have never received any thin film revenues from japan  because the mhlw has not approved thin film for sale in japan yet 
the cmf product revenues represent sales of the cmf surgical implants product line used for trauma and reconstructive procedures in the mid face and craniofacial skeleton the head and skull 
we sold this product line to medtronic in as with the thin film products  we sold cmf products at cost in under a contractual back up supply agreement with medtronic 
a portion of the deferred gain on sale of assets  related party was recognized as revenue in order to reflect the fair value of products sold  based on historical selling prices of similar products  over our manufacturing cost 
during the third quarter of  we completed all remaining performance obligations related to the sale of the cmf product line to medtronic 
therefore  we did not earn any cmf product revenues during the years ended december  and and will not generate revenue from this product line in the future 
the future our revenue from spine and orthopedic products is dependent upon the market s adoption of our technology  which is largely dependent upon medtronic s marketing efforts and pricing strategies 
therefore our visibility of the size and timing of hydrosorb and mystique orders is limited 
since we rely on medtronic s ability and commitment to build and expand the market share for our products and we have been disappointed in the past by their effort at such  it is possible that we will not receive more than minimal orders for the mystique portion of the hydrosorb product line during since it is unlikely that we will see significant sales of the current non mystique products any time in the future  it is likely that we will continue to see losses in our medtronic dependent macropore biosurgery business going forward 
we are trying to scale back macropore biosurgery s expenses to reflect our modest expectations of future revenues 
all product revenues are currently attributable to medtronic as domestic thin film revenues ceased in this may change when commercialization of the thin film products in japan occurs and we begin thin film shipments to senko  which we believe will happen in 
table of contents cost of product revenues cost of product revenues includes material  manufacturing labor  overhead costs and an inventory provision 
the following table summarizes the components of our cost of revenues for the years ended december   and years ended and differences differences to to to to cost of product revenues cost of product revenues of product revenues inventory provision of product revenues stock based compensation of product revenues total cost of product revenues total cost of product revenues as of product revenues macropore biosurgery our product revenues are currently generated only through sales of bioresorbable products and therefore  cost of revenues is related only to our macropore biosurgery segment 
the change in cost of revenues for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in as well as between and were due primarily to amounts of fixed labor and overhead costs applied to product revenues in each period 
as macropore revenues have declined  gross margins have been negatively affected by fixed costs 
in response to macropore biosurgery s declining revenues  we are seeking to reduce expenses 
we reduced our headcount by people in the third quarter of a portion of the affected personnel related to the macropore biosurgery segment 
cost of product revenues includes approximately  and  of stock based compensation expense for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for further details  see stock based compensation discussion below 
during the years ended december    and  we recorded a provision of   and  respectively  related primarily to excess and slow moving inventory 
in and  this inventory was produced in anticipation of stocking orders from medtronic which did not materialize 
the  inventory provision during related to excess inventory produced in consideration of our responsibility to be a back up supplier for the cmf product line 
we sold the assets related to this product line to a subsidiary of medtronic in september in april of  medtronic indicated that it would no longer purchase cmf inventory from us under the back up supply arrangement  leading to our determination that the remaining cmf inventory on hand would not be recoverable 
the future 
ceasing to manufacture the cmf product line and the non japan bioresorbable thin film product line  combined with the poor rate of orders from medtronic deprives us of economies of scale and has and will continue to negatively impact our margins 
we do not expect demand for our hydrosorb mystique products  which depends largely on medtronic s marketing efforts  to increase in the future 
in an effort to reduce overhead costs related to the macropore biosurgery segment  we have accelerated termination of two of our leases 
as a result  one of our leases will terminate in april and we will be subletting only a small portion of the other building during the first half of as mentioned above  it appears that the spine and orthopedics business is not succeeding under our stewardship 
as a result  our board of directors has decided to divest and is actively seeking a buyer or buyers for these assets

during the year ended december   we recognized  of revenue associated with our arrangements with olympus 
the revenue recognized in was a result of completing a pre clinical study in the first quarter of  receiving a ce mark for the first generation celution system  and reaching three additional milestones in the fourth quarter of one milestone related to the completion of a pre clinical study while the other two were results of product development efforts 
there was no similar revenue in the research grant revenue relates to our agreement with the national institutes of health nih 
under this arrangement  the nih reimburses us for qualifying expenditures related to research on adipose derived cell therapy for myocardial infarction 
to receive funds under the grant arrangement  we are required to i demonstrate that we incurred qualifying expenses  as defined in the grant agreement between the nih and us  ii maintain a system of controls  whereby we can accurately track and report all expenditures related solely to research on adipose derived cell therapy for myocardial infarction  and iii file appropriate forms and follow appropriate protocols established by the nih 
our policy is to recognize revenues under the nih grant arrangement as the lesser of i qualifying costs incurred and not previously recognized  plus our allowable grant fees for which we are entitled to funding or ii the amount determined by comparing the outputs generated to date versus the total outputs expected to be achieved under the research arrangement 
during the year ended december   we incurred  in expenditures  of which  were qualified

macropore biosurgery thin film under a distribution agreement with senko we are entitled to earn payments based on achieving the following defined milestones upon notifying senko of completion of the initial regulatory application to the mhlw for the thin film product  we were entitled to a nonrefundable payment of  we so notified senko on september   received payment in october of  and recorded deferred revenues of  as of december   of the amount deferred  we have recognized development revenues of   in   in  and  in 
we are also entitled to a nonrefundable payment of  once we achieve commercialization 
finally  under this agreement  we also received a  license fee that was recorded as a component of deferred revenues in the accompanying balance sheet 
because the  in license fees is potentially refundable  such amounts will not be recognized as revenues until the refund rights expire 
specifically  half of the license fee is refundable if the parties agree commercialization is not achievable and a proportional amount is refundable if we terminate the arrangement  other than for material breach by senko  before three years post commercialization 
the future we expect to recognize revenues from our regenerative cell technology segment during as we complete certain pre clinical studies and certain phases of our product development performance obligations 
if we are successful in achieving certain milestone points related to these activities  we will recognize approximately  in revenues in the exact timing of when amounts will be reported in revenue will depend on internal factors for instance  our ability to complete the service obligations we have agreed to perform as well as external considerations  including obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals for various therapeutic applications related to the celution system 
the cash for these performance obligations was received when the agreement was signed and no further related cash payments will be made to us 
we will continue to recognize revenue from the development work we are performing on behalf of senko  based on the relative fair value of the milestones completed as compared to the total efforts expected to be necessary to obtain regulatory clearance with the mhlw 
obtaining regulatory clearance with the mhlw for initial commercialization is expected in accordingly  we expect to recognize approximately  consisting of  in deferred revenues plus a non refundable payment of  to be received upon commercialization in revenues associated with this milestone arrangement in moreover  we expect to recognize  per year associated with deferred senko license fees over a three year period following commercialization as the refund rights associated with the license payment expire

macropore biosurgery general corporate marketing expenditures relate to expenditures for maintaining our corporate image and reputation within the research and surgical communities 
the decrease from the year ended december  as compared to was due to a strategic decision to allocate resources towards our regenerative cell technology marketing  which in turn prompted a reduction in headcount in biomaterials and general corporate marketing 
the decrease in as compared to was due to one time costs incurred for an educational program we created in to inform end users and distributors of the benefits and surgical applications for our biomaterials products 
domestic sales and marketing expenditures related to expenses associated with managing our domestic bioresorbable thin film product distribution  which included independent sales representatives and our domestic thin film sales consultants and marketing staff

prior to january   the stock based compensation expenditures connected to options granted to employees and directors in their capacity as board members is the difference between the exercise price of the stock based awards and the market value of our underlying common stock on the date of the grant 
unearned employee stock based compensation is amortized over the remaining vesting periods of the options  which generally vest over a four year period from the date of grant 
from january  onwards  we adopted fasb no 
revised  share based payments 
under this pronouncement  we measure stock based compensation expense based on the grant date fair value of any awards granted to our employees 
such expense is recognized over the period of time that employees provide service to us and earn all rights to the awards 
stock based compensation expense related to common stock issued to non employees is the fair value of the stock on the date of issuance  even if such stock contains sales restrictions

similarly  in the second quarter of  we issued  shares of restricted common stock to a non employee scientific advisor 
the stock is restricted in that it cannot be sold for a specified period of time 
there are no vesting requirements 
because the shares issued are not subject to additional future vesting or service requirements  the stock based compensation expense of  recorded in the first quarter of and  recorded in the second quarter of constitutes the entire expense related to these grants  and no future period charges will be reported 
the scientific advisors also receive cash consideration as services are performed

there will be no further charges related to these modifications 
in august  our chief operating officer coo  ceased employment with us 
we agreed to pay the former coo a lump sum cash severance payment of  and extended the exercise period for two years on  vested stock options 
the incremental value of the options due to the modification was  we recorded an expense in the third quarter of to reflect the lump sum cash severance payment and the value of the vested stock options  which constitutes the entire expense related to these options  and no future period charges will be required 
this  was allocated in the table above in equal portions among three departmental categories  consistent with previous allocations of the former coo s compensation expense 
the future 
we will continue to grant options which will result in an expense to our employees and  as appropriate  to non employee service providers 
in addition  previously granted options will continue to vest in accordance with their original terms 
as of december   the total compensation cost related to non vested stock options not yet recognized for all our plans is approximately  these costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 

table of contents change in fair value of option liabilities the following is a table summarizing the change in fair value of option liabilities for the years ended december   and years ended differences differences to to to to change in fair value of option liability change in fair value of put option liability total change in fair value of option liabilities we granted olympus an option to acquire  shares of our common stock which expired december  the exercise price of the option shares was per share 
we had accounted for this grant as a liability because had the option been exercised  we would have been required to deliver listed shares of our common stock to settle the option shares 
in accordance with eitf  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  the fair value of this option was re measured at the end of each quarter  using the black scholes option pricing model  with the movement in fair value reported in the statement of operations as a change in fair value of option liabilities 
in reference to the joint venture  the shareholders agreement between cytori and olympus provides that in certain specified circumstances of insolvency or if we experience a change in control  olympus will have the rights to i repurchase our interests in the joint venture at the fair value of such interests or ii sell its own interests in the joint venture to us at the higher of a  or b the put s fair value 
the put value has been classified as a liability 
the valuations of the put were completed by an independent valuation firm using an option pricing theory based simulation analysis ie  a monte carlo simulation 
the valuations are based on assumptions as of the valuation date with regard to the market value of cytori and the estimated fair value of the joint venture  the expected correlation between the values of cytori and the joint venture  the expected volatility of cytori and the joint venture  the bankruptcy recovery rate for cytori  the bankruptcy threshold for cytori  the probability of a change of control event for cytori  and the risk free interest rate

as part of the disposal arrangement  we agreed to complete certain performance obligations which prevented us from recognizing the gain on sale of assets when the cash was initially received 
in august  following the settlement of arbitration proceedings related to the sale agreement  we were able to recognize the gain on sale of assets of  less  of related deferred costs  in the statement of operations 
the gain on sale of assets  related party related to the initial payment as well as milestone payments from medtronic for the disposition of our cmf product line in specifically  as part of the disposal arrangement  we agreed to complete clinical research regarding faster resorbable polymer  an area that directly relates to the cmf product line we transferred to medtronic 
in january  we received the  payment after fulfilling the research requirements set out in the cmf sale agreement 
we were also obliged to transfer certain know how  including manufacturing processes  patents  and other intellectual property  to medtronic 
this obligation was fulfilled and in the third quarter of we received  from medtronic 
these milestones represented the last of all remaining performance obligations and therefore  we were able to recognize the remaining deferred gain on the sale of assets  related party  of  in the statement of operations 
the future 
no additional gains will be recognized related to either sale

the loss related to the payment of a portion of the original capital which olympus invested in the joint venture back to olympus  in exchange for a development services agreement 
the future 
we do not expect to recognize significant losses from the activities of the joint venture in the foreseeable future 
over the next two to three years  the joint venture is expected to incur modest general and administrative expenses  offset by royalty income expected to begin in when cytori commercializes its celution system in europe 
though we have no obligation to do so  we and olympus plan to jointly fund the joint venture to cover any costs should the joint venture deplete its cash balance

table of contents critical accounting policies and significant estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and that affect our recognition and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
while our estimates are based on assumptions we consider reasonable at the time they were made  our actual results may differ from our estimates  perhaps significantly 
if results differ materially from our estimates  we will make adjustments to our financial statements prospectively as we become aware of the necessity for an adjustment 
we believe it is important for you to understand our most critical accounting policies 
these are our policies that require us to make our most significant judgments and  as a result  could have the greatest impact on our future financial results 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue from a number of different sources  including but not limited to fees for achieving certain defined milestones under research and or development arrangements 
product sales  and payments under license or distribution agreements 
a number of our revenue generating arrangements are relatively simple in nature  meaning that there is little judgment necessary with regard to the timing of when we recognize revenues or how such revenues are presented in the financial statements 
however  we have also entered into more complex arrangements  including but not limited to our contracts with olympus  senko  and the nih 
moreover  some of our non recurring transactions  such as our disposition of the majority of our thin film business to mast  contain elements that relate to our product revenue producing activities 
as a result  some of our most critical accounting judgments relate to the identification  timing  and presentation of revenue related activities 
these critical judgments are discussed further in the paragraphs that follow 
multiple elements some of our revenue generating arrangements contains a number of distinct revenue streams  known as elements 
for example  our distribution agreement with senko contains direct or indirect future revenue streams related to a distribution license fee which was paid at the outset of the arrangement  milestone payments for achieving commercialization of the thin film product line in japan  training for representatives of senko  sales of thin film products to senko  and payments in the nature of royalties on future product sales made by senko to its end customers 
emerging issues task force issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  governs whether each of the above elements in the arrangement should be accounted for individually  or whether the entire contract should be treated as a single unit of accounting 
eitf indicates that individual elements may be separately accounted for only when the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer  there is objective evidence of the fair value of the remaining undelivered elements  and if the arrangement contains a general right of return related to any products delivered  delivery of the remaining goods and services is probable and within the complete control of the seller 

table of contents in the case of the senko distribution agreement  we determined that a the milestones payments for achieving commercialization and b the future sale of thin film products to senko were separable elements 
that is  each of these elements  upon delivery  will have stand alone value to senko and there will be objective evidence of the fair value of any remaining undelivered elements at that time 
the arrangement does not contain any general right of return  and so this point is not relevant to our analysis 
on the other hand  we concluded that a the upfront distribution license fee  b the revenues from training for representatives of senko  and c the payments in the form of royalties on future product sales are not separable elements under eitf in arriving at our conclusions  we had to consider whether our customer  senko  would receive stand alone value from each delivered element 
we also  in some cases  had to look to third party evidence to support the fair value of certain undelivered elements notably  training since we as a company do not routinely deliver this service on a stand alone basis 
finally  we had to make assumptions about how the non separable elements of the arrangement are earned  particularly the estimated period over which senko will benefit from the arrangement refer to the recognition discussion below for further background 
we also agreed to perform multiple services under the november  agreements we signed with olympus  including granting the joint venture which olympus is considered to control an exclusive and perpetual manufacturing license to our device technology  including the celution system and certain related intellectual property  and performing development activities in relation to certain therapeutic applications associated with our celution system  including completing pre clinical and clinical trials  seeking regulatory approval as appropriate  and assisting with product development 
we concluded that the license and development services must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
in reaching this conclusion  we determined that the license would not have stand alone value to the joint venture 
this is because cytori is the only party that could be reasonably expected to perform the development services  including pre clinical and clinical studies  regulatory filings  and product development  necessary for the joint venture to derive any value from the license 
recognition besides determining whether to account separately for components of a multiple element arrangement  we also use judgment in determining the appropriate accounting period in which to recognize revenues that we believe a have been earned and b are realizable 
the following describes some of the recognition issues we have considered during the reporting period 
upfront license fees milestones o as part of the senko distribution agreement  we received an upfront license fee upon execution of the arrangement  which  as noted previously  was not separable under eitf accordingly  the license has been combined with the development milestones element  which was separable  to form a single accounting unit 
this single element of  in fees includes  which is potentially refundable 
we have recognized  and will continue to recognize  the non contingent fees allocated to this combined element as revenues as we complete each of the performance obligations associated with the milestones component of this combined deliverable 
note that the timing of when we have recognized revenues to date does not correspond with the cash we received upon achieving certain milestones 
for example  the first such milestone payment for  became payable to us when we filed a commercialization application with the japanese regulatory authorities 
however  we determined that the payment received was not commensurate with the level of effort expended  particularly when compared with other steps we believe are necessary to commercialize the thin film product line in japan 
accordingly  we did not recognize the entire  received as revenues  but instead all but  of this amount is classified as deferred revenues 
approximately   in   in and  in has been recognized to date as development revenues based on our estimates of the level of effort expended for completed milestones as compared with the total level of effort we expect to incur under the arrangement to successfully achieve regulatory approval of the thin film product line in japan 
these estimates were subject to judgment and there may be changes in estimates regarding the total level of effort as we continue to seek regulatory approval 
in fact there can be no assurance that commercialization in japan will ever be achieved  although our latest understanding is that regulatory approval will be received in o we also received upfront fees as part of the olympus arrangements although  unlike in the senko agreement  these fees were non refundable 
specifically  in exchange for an upfront fee  we granted the joint venture an exclusive  perpetual license to certain of our intellectual property and agreed to perform additional development activities 
this upfront fee has been recorded in the liability account entitled deferred revenues  related party  on our consolidated balance sheet 
similar to the senko agreement  we have elected an accounting policy to recognize revenues from the combined license development accounting unit as we perform the development services  as this represents our final obligation underlying the combined accounting unit 
specifically  we plan to recognize revenues from the license development accounting unit using a proportional performance methodology  resulting in the de recognition of amounts recorded in the deferred revenues  related party  account as we complete various milestones underlying the development services 
for instance  we have and will continue to recognize some of the deferred revenues  related party as revenues  related party  when we complete a pre clinical trial  or obtain regulatory approval in a specific jurisdiction 
determining what portion of the deferred revenues  related party balance to recognize as each milestone is completed involves substantial judgment 
in allocating the balance of the deferred revenues  related party to various milestones  we had in depth discussions with our operations personnel regarding the relative value of each milestone to the joint venture and olympus 
we also considered the cost of completing each milestone relative to the total costs we plan to incur in completing all of the development activities  since we believe that the relative cost of completing a milestone is a reasonable proxy for its fair value 
the accounting policy described above could result in revenues being recorded in an earlier accounting period than had other judgments or assumptions been made by us 

table of contents government grants o we are eligible to receive grants from the nih related to our research on adipose derived cell therapy to treat myocardial infarctions 
there are no specific standards under us gaap that prescribe the recognition or classification of these grants in the statement of operations 
absent such guidance  we have established an accounting policy to recognize nih grant revenues at the lesser of qualifying costs incurred and not previously recognized  plus any allowable grant fees  for which cytori is entitled to grant funding  or  the amount determined by comparing the research outputs generated to date versus the total outputs that are expected to be achieved under the entire arrangement 
o our accounting policy could theoretically defer revenue recognition beyond the period in which we have earned the rights to such fees 
however  we selected this accounting policy to counteract the possibility of recognizing revenues from the nih arrangement too early 
for instance  if our policy permitted revenues to be recognized solely as qualifying costs were incurred  we could alter the amount of revenue recognized by incurring more or less cost in a given period  irrespective of whether these costs correlate to the research outputs generated 
on the other hand  if revenue recognition were based on output measures alone  it would be possible to recognize revenue in excess of costs actually incurred  this is not appropriate since qualifying costs remain the basis of our funding under the nih grant 
the application of our accounting policy  nonetheless  involves significant judgment  particularly in estimating the percentage of outputs realized to date versus the total outputs expected to be achieved under the grant arrangement 
back up supply arrangement we agreed to serve as a back up supplier of products in connection with our dispositions of specific thin film assets to mast 
specifically  we agreed to supply thin film product to mast at our cost for a defined period of time  which has since then expired 
when we actually delivered products under the back up supply arrangements in  however  we recognized revenues in the financial statements at the estimated selling price which we would receive in the marketplace 
we used judgment  based on historical data and expectations about future market trends  in determining the estimated market selling price of products subject to the back up supply arrangements 
the amount of the deferred gain recognized as revenue is equal to the excess of the fair value of products sold  based on historical selling prices of similar products  over our manufacturing cost 
presentation we have presented amounts earned under our nih research arrangement as research grant revenue 
we believe that the activities underlying the nih agreement constituted a portion of our ongoing major or central operations 
moreover  the government obtains rights under the arrangement  in the same manner but perhaps not to the same extent as a commercial customer that similarly contracts with us to perform research activities 
for instance  the government and any authorized third parties may use our federally funded research and or inventions without payment of royalties to us 

table of contents goodwill impairment testing in late  we purchased stemsource  inc and recognized over  in goodwill associated with the acquisition  of which  remains on our balance sheet as of december  as required by statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we must test this goodwill at least annually for impairment as well as when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that impairment may exist 
moreover  this testing must be performed at a level of the organization known as the reporting unit 
a reporting unit is at least the same level as a company s operating segments  and sometimes even one level lower 
our two reporting units are  in fact  our two operating segments 
specifically  the process for testing goodwill for impairment under sfas involves the following steps company assets and liabilities  including goodwill  are allocated to each reporting unit for purposes of completing the goodwill impairment test 
the carrying value of each reporting unit that is  the sum of all of the net assets allocated to the reporting unit is then compared to its fair value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its carrying amount  goodwill may be impaired additional testing is required 
when we last completed our goodwill impairment testing in  the fair values of our two reporting units each exceeded their respective carrying values 
accordingly  we determined that none of our reported goodwill was impaired 
the application of the goodwill impairment test involves a substantial amount of judgment 
for instance  sfas requires that assets and liabilities be assigned to a reporting unit if both of the following criteria are met the asset will be employed in or the liability relates to the operations of a reporting unit 
the asset or liability will be considered in determining the fair value of the reporting unit 
we developed mechanisms to assign company wide assets like shared property and equipment  as well as company wide obligations such as borrowings under our ge loan facility  to our two reporting units 
in some cases  certain assets were not allocable to either reporting unit and were left unassigned 
the most complex and challenging asset to assign to each reporting unit was our acquired goodwill 
as noted previously  all of our recorded goodwill was generated in connection with our acquisition of stemsource in however  when we first acquired stemsource  we determined that a portion of the goodwill related to the macropore biosurgery reporting unit 
the amount of goodwill allocated represented our best estimate of the synergies notably future cost savings from shared research and development activities that the macropore biosurgery reporting unit would obtain by virtue of the acquisition 
finally  with the consultation and assistance of a third party  we estimated the fair value of our reporting units by using various estimation techniques 
in particular  in  we estimated the fair value of our macropore biosurgery reporting unit based on an equal weighting of the market values of comparable enterprises and discounted projections of estimated future cash flows 
clearly  identifying comparable companies and estimating future cash flows as well as appropriate discount rates involve judgment 
on the contrary  we estimated the fair value of our regenerative cell reporting unit solely using an income approach  as we believe there are no comparable enterprises on which to base a valuation 
the assumptions underlying this valuation method involve a substantial amount of judgment  particularly since our regenerative cell business has yet to generate any revenues and does not have a commercially viable product 
the combined value of our goodwill is consistent with the market s valuation 
again  the manner in which we assigned assets  liabilities  and goodwill to our reporting units  as well as how we determined the fair value of such reporting units  involves significant uncertainties and estimates 
the judgments employed may have an effect on whether a goodwill impairment loss is recognized 

table of contents dispositions in  we sold most of the assets and intellectual property rights in our non japan thin film product line to mast 
as is common in the life sciences industry  the sale agreements contained provisions beyond the simple transfer of net assets to the acquiring enterprises for a fixed price 
specifically  as part of the arrangement  we also agreed to perform the following services provide training to mast personnel on production and other aspects of the thin film product lines  and provide a back up supply of thin film products to mast  at cost  for a specified period of time 
disposing of assets and product lines is not one of our core ongoing or central activities 
accordingly  determining the appropriate accounting for these transactions involved some of our most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
in particular  we made assumptions around the appropriate manner and timing in which to recognize the gain on disposal for each transaction in the statement of operations 
we initially deferred recognition of the gain related to our disposition of certain thin film assets  which occurred in may again  the asset purchase agreement governing the thin film sale obligated us to perform certain actions for the benefit of the buyer mast for a defined period of time  such as serving as a back up supplier 
we concluded  due to the arbitration proceedings settled in august that we completed our remaining performance obligations during the third quarter of accordingly  we recognized the remaining deferred gain on sale of assets as gain on sale of assets 
we also recognized a portion of the deferred gain when we sold products to mast under the back up supply agreement in refer to the revenue recognition section of this critical accounting policies and significant estimates discussion for further details 
variable interest entity olympus cytori joint venture fasb interpretation no 
revised  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
fin r requires a variable interest entity vie to be consolidated by its primary beneficiary 
evaluating whether an entity is a vie and determining its primary beneficiary involves significant judgment 
in concluding that the olympus cytori joint venture was a vie  we considered the following factors under fin r  an entity is a vie if it has insufficient equity to finance its activities 
we recognized that the initial cash contributed to the joint venture formed by olympus and cytori  would be completely utilized by the first quarter of moreover  it was highly unlikely that the joint venture would be able to obtain the necessary financing from third party lenders without additional subordinated financial support such as personal guarantees by one or both of the joint venture stockholders 
accordingly  the joint venture will require additional financial support from olympus and cytori to finance its ongoing operations  indicating that the joint venture is a vie 
in fact  in the first quarter of  we contributed  each to fund the joint venture s ongoing operations 
moreover  olympus has a contingent put option that would  in specified circumstances  require cytori to purchase olympus s interests in the joint venture for a fixed amount of  accordingly  olympus is protected in some circumstances from absorbing all expected losses in the joint venture 
under fin r  this means that olympus may not be an at risk equity holder  although olympus clearly has decision rights over the operations of the joint venture 
because the joint venture is undercapitalized  and because one of the joint venture s decision makers may be protected from losses  we have determined that the joint venture is a vie under fin r 
because of the complexities in applying fin r  it is reasonable to expect that others may reach a different conclusion 
as noted previously  a vie is consolidated by its primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is defined in fin r as the entity that would absorb the majority of the vie s expected losses or be entitled to receive the majority of the vie s residual returns or both 
significant judgment was involved in determining the primary beneficiary of the joint venture 
under fin r  we believe that olympus and cytori are de facto agents and  together  will absorb more than of the joint venture s expected losses and residual returns 
ultimately  we concluded that olympus  and not cytori  was the party most closely related with the joint venture and  hence  its primary beneficiary 
our conclusion was based on the following factors the business operations of the joint venture will be most closely aligned to those of olympus ie  the manufacture of devices 
olympus controls the board of directors  as well as the day to day operations of the joint venture 
the application of fin r involves substantial judgment  and others may arrive at a conclusion that cytori should consolidate the joint venture 
had we consolidated the joint venture  though  there would be no effect on our net loss or shareholders equity at december  or for the year then ended 
however  certain balance sheet and income statement captions would have been presented in a different manner 
for instance  we would not have presented a single line item entitled investment in joint venture in our balance sheet but  instead  would have performed a line by line consolidation of each of the joint venture s accounts into our financial statements 

table of contents net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we have established a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of such assets 
we periodically evaluate the recoverability of the deferred tax asset 
at such time as it is determined that it is more likely than not that deferred assets are realizable  the valuation allowance will be reduced 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of  as of december  to reflect the estimated amount of deferred tax assets that may not be realized 
we increased our valuation allowance by approximately  during the year ended december  the valuation allowance includes approximately  related to stock option deductions  the benefit of which  if realized  will eventually be credited to equity and not to income

the internal revenue code limits the future availability of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that arose prior to certain cumulative changes in a corporation s ownership resulting in a change of control of cytori 
due to prior ownership changes as defined in irc section  a portion of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are limited in their annual utilization

recent accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain hybrid instruments an amendment of fasb statements nos 
and sfas 
sfas allows companies to elect an accounting policy choice for so called hybrid instruments 
a hybrid instrument is a contract that contains one or more embedded derivatives 
in many cases  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedge accounting sfas requires that an embedded derivative be separated from the host contract and accounted for at fair value in the financial statements 
sfas removes the mandatory requirement to bifurcate an embedded derivative if the holder elects to account for the entire instrument that is  both the host contract and the embedded derivative at fair value  with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
sfas is effective for all hybrid instruments acquired or issued on or after september  and may be applied to hybrid financial instruments that had been bifurcated under sfas in the past 
the adoption of sfas has not had a significant effect on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
this is an interpretation of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
it prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of fin is not expected to have a significant effect on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the emerging issues task force on issue no 
 how sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement eitf 
eitf requires a company to disclose its accounting policy ie gross vs 
net basis relating to the presentation of taxes within the scope of eitf furthermore  for taxes reported on a gross basis  an enterprise should disclose the amounts of those taxes in interim and annual financial statements for each period for which an income statement is presented 
the guidance is effective for all periods beginning after december  the adoption of eitf is not expected to have a significant effect on our financial statements 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements 
sab requires registrants to quantify misstatements using both an income statement rollover and balance sheet iron curtain approach and evaluate whether either approach results in a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
if prior year errors that had been previously considered immaterial now are considered material based on either approach  no restatement is required so long as management properly applied its previous approach and all relevant facts and circumstances were considered 
if prior years are not restated  the cumulative effect adjustment is recorded in opening accumulated earnings deficit as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending on or after november   with earlier adoption encouraged 
the adoption of sab has not had a significant effect on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements 
sfas applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and accordingly  does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a significant effect on our financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates and in foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate exposure we are not subject to market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates on our long term obligations as they bear a fixed rate of interest 
our exposure relates primarily to short term investments 
these short term investments  reported at an aggregate fair market value of  as of december   consist primarily of investments in debt instruments of financial institutions and corporations with strong credit ratings and united states government obligations 
these securities are subject to market rate risk as their fair value will fall if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by basis points from the levels prevailing at december   for example  and assuming average investment duration of seven months  the fair value of the portfolio would not decline by a material amount 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risk inherent in these securities 
however  we do attempt to reduce such risks by generally limiting the maturity date of such securities  diversifying our investments and limiting the amount of credit exposure with any one issuer 
while we do not always have the intent  we do currently have the ability to hold these investments until maturity and  therefore  believe that reductions in the value of such securities attributable to short term fluctuations in interest rates would not materially affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
changes in interest rates would  of course  affect the interest income we earn on our cash balances after re investment 
foreign currency exchange rate exposure our exposure to market risk due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our cash balances in europe and japan 
transaction gains or losses resulting from cash balances and revenues have not been significant in the past and we are not engaged in any hedging activity in the euro  the yen or other currencies 
based on our cash balances and revenues derived from markets other than the united states for the year ended december   a hypothetical adverse change in the euro or yen against the us dollar would not result in a material foreign currency exchange loss 
consequently  we do not expect that reductions in the value of such sales denominated in foreign currencies resulting from even a sudden or significant fluctuation in foreign exchange rates would have a direct material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
notwithstanding the foregoing  the indirect effect of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may affect international demand for our products 
in addition  interest rate fluctuations may affect our customers buying patterns 
furthermore  interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations may broadly influence the united states and foreign economies resulting in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
under our japanese thin film agreement with senko  we would receive payments in the nature of royalties based on senko s net sales  which would be yen denominated 
we expect such sales or royalties to begin in
