item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
management s overview epiq is a provider of technology based solutions for the legal and fiduciary services industries 
our products and services assist clients with the administration of complex legal proceedings  including electronic litigation discovery  bankruptcy administration and class action administration 
we have two operating segments case management and document management 
our case management segment generates revenue primarily through integrated technology based products and services that support client engagements for electronic discovery  class action and mass tort  and bankruptcy proceedings that can last several years and has a revenue profile that typically includes a recurring component 
our document management segment generates revenue primarily through legal noticing services  reimbursement for costs incurred related to postage on mailing services  media campaign and advertising management and document custody services 
document management revenue is generally less recurring due to the unpredictable nature of the frequency  timing  and magnitude of the clients business requirements 
the number of new bankruptcy filings each year may vary based on the level of consumer and business debt  the general economy  interest rate levels and other factors 
for the government fiscal years ended september    and  the administrative office of the us courts reported approximately million  million  and million new bankruptcy filings  respectively 
we believe an important indicator of future bankruptcy filings is the level of consumer and business debt outstanding 
the most recent available federal reserve flow of funds accounts of the united states  dated december   reported increases in both consumer and business debt outstanding as compared with the same period of the prior year 
for our chapter bankruptcy services  our end user customers are professional bankruptcy trustees 
the application of chapter bankruptcy regulations has the practical effect of discouraging trustee customers from incurring direct administrative costs for computer system expenses 
as a result  we provide our chapter services to trustee customers at no direct charge  and our trustee customers maintain deposit accounts for bankruptcy cases under their administration at a designated banking institution 
we have marketing arrangements with various banks under which we provide chapter bankruptcy trustee case management software and related services and the bank provides the chapter bankruptcy trustee with deposit related banking services 
our most significant marketing arrangement is with our primary depository institution  bank of america 
under this arrangement  we primarily receive revenue based on the aggregate amount of trustee deposits and the number of chapter trustees which we refer to collectively as volume based fees 
these volume based fees compensate us for the software license  hardware and postcontract customer support services that we provide to the chapter bankruptcy trustees 
prior to october  our primary depository institution engaged us to provide the trustees with software upgrades in the first and second quarter of each year 
these software upgrades were documented in arrangements which were separate from our volume based fee arrangement 
once the upgrade was delivered to the trustees and we had provided satisfactory evidence of the delivery  we would invoice the primary depository institution for the agreed upon amount and recognize revenue related to the software upgrade 
in october  we entered into a new arrangement the arrangement with the primary depository institution 
as a part of the arrangement  we agreed to continue to perform each of our first and second quarter software upgrades through the term of the arrangement  and the primary depository institution agreed to compensate us for these upgrades on terms similar to our historical terms when we delivered the upgrades on a standalone basis 
as the arrangement included volume based pricing related to our software license  hardware and postcontract customer support services  as well as pricing related to software upgrades and special projects  the arrangement was considered a bundled arrangement 
as the arrangement involved the delivery of software  we accounted for this arrangement pursuant to statement of position  software revenue recognition sop 
for bundled arrangements  sop requires that for separate elements of the arrangement  such as software upgrades  we must be able to establish vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value 
vsoe is established based on the price charged when the same element is sold on a standalone basis 
although we historically sold software upgrades on a standalone basis  each software upgrade is considered a separate product and  therefore  we determined that the price of prior software upgrades cannot be used to establish the price of future software upgrades 
as the primary financial institution was our only payee for software upgrades during the period of the arrangement  we were unable to establish vsoe for the software upgrades 
under sop  if vsoe cannot be established for software upgrades  then consideration received under the arrangement  except for consideration related to the provision of hardware and hardware maintenance  must be deferred until all software upgrades have been delivered 
under the terms of the arrangement  the final software upgrade was delivered in the second quarter of although  during the period of the arrangement  we continued to invoice  and the primary financial institution continued to pay  our volume based fees related to software licenses and postcontract customer support as well as our semi annual software upgrades  we did not recognize these amounts as revenue 
instead  these amounts were recorded as deferred revenue liability through the first quarter of substantially all deferred revenue was recognized during the second quarter of when the final upgrade was delivered 
the remaining amount of deferred revenue was recognized during the third quarter of when the arrangement terminated 
throughout the period of the arrangement  we continued to recognize revenue related to the hardware and hardware maintenance we provided to chapter trustees as this revenue is accounted for pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for leases 
this revenue is a relatively minor component of the arrangement 
during february  we entered into a new arrangement with our primary depository institution  which became effective october  as specified software upgrades and special projects are not contained in this contract  this arrangement does not require the deferral of revenue 
as a result  the revenue is recognized as explained under critical accounting policies revenue recognition software arrangements below 
we have acquired a number of businesses during the past several years 
in january  we acquired poorman douglas and expanded our product and service offerings to include class action  mass tort  and other similar legal proceedings 
in october  we acquired hilsoft to enhance our ability to provide specialized media placement services related to class action  mass tort and bankruptcy noticing 
in november  we acquired nmatrix to expand our product and service offerings to include electronic discovery 
in may  we acquired epiq advisory services to expand our capabilities in claims preference services 
critical accounting policies we consider our accounting policies related to revenue recognition  share based compensation  business combinations  goodwill  and identifiable intangible assets to be critical policies in understanding our historical and future performance 
revenue recognition 
we have agreements with clients pursuant to which we deliver various case management and document management services each month 
significant sources of revenue include fees contingent upon the month to month delivery of case management services defined by client contracts  such as claims processing  claims reconciliation  professional services  call center support  and conversion of data into an organized  searchable electronic database 
the amount we earn varies based primarily on the size and complexity of the engagement  hosting fees based on the amount of data stored  deposit based fees from financial institutions  primarily based on a percentage of total liquidated assets placed on deposit at that financial institution by our bankruptcy trustee clients  to whom we provide  at no charge  software licenses  limited hardware and hardware maintenance  and postcontract customer support pcs services  legal noticing services to parties of interest in bankruptcy and class action matters  including media campaign and advertising management  in which we coordinate notification through various media outlets  such as print  radio and television  to potential parties of interest for a particular client engagement  and reimbursement for costs incurred related to postage on mailing services 
non software arrangements case and document management services related to electronic discovery  corporate restructuring  and class action revenue  which are billed based on volume  are evaluated pursuant to emerging issues task force eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
for each of these contractual arrangements  we have identified the following deliverables and or services electronic discovery data processing hosting corporate restructuring consulting claims management printing and reproduction mailing and noticing document management class action consulting notice campaigns toll free customer support web site design hosting claims administration distribution based on our evaluation of each element  we have determined that each element delivered has standalone value to our customers because we or other vendors sell such services separately from any other services deliverables 
we have also obtained objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of each element based either on the price we charge when we sell an element on a standalone basis or based on third party evidence of fair value of such services 
lastly  our arrangements do not include general rights of return 
accordingly  each of the service elements in our multiple element case and document management arrangements qualifies as a separate unit of accounting under eitf we allocate revenue to the various units of accounting in our arrangements based on the fair value of each unit of accounting  which is generally consistent with the stated prices in our arrangements 
as we have evidence of an arrangement  revenue for each separate unit of accounting is recognized each period in accordance with staff accounting bulletin topic  revenue recognition sab topic 
as the services are rendered  our fee becomes fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
payments received in advance of satisfaction of the related revenue recognition criteria are recognized as a customer deposit until all revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied 
software arrangements for our chapter bankruptcy trustee arrangements  we provide our trustee clients with a software license  hardware lease  hardware maintenance  and postcontract customer support pcs services  all at no charge to the trustee 
the trustees place their liquidated estate deposits with a financial institution with which we have an arrangement 
we earn contingent monthly fees from the financial institutions based on the dollar level of average monthly deposits placed by the trustees with that financial institution  from the financial institution related to the software license  hardware lease  hardware maintenance  and pcs services 
we account for the software license and pcs elements in accordance with statement of position  software revenue recognition sop 
since we have not established vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of the software license  we do not recognize any revenue on delivery of the software 
the software element is deferred and included with the remaining undelivered element  which is pcs 
this revenue  when recognized  is included as a component of case management services revenue 
revenue related to pcs is entirely contingent on the placement of liquidated estate deposits by the trustee with the financial institution 
accordingly  except for the arrangement described in the following paragraph  we recognize this contingent usage based revenue consistent with the guidance provided by the american institute of certified public accountants technical practice aid tpa  fair value in multiple element arrangements that include contingent usage based fees and software revenue recognition as the fee becomes fixed or determinable at the time actual usage occurs and collectibility is probable 
this occurs monthly as a result of the computation  billing and collection of monthly deposit fees contractually agreed to 
at that time  we have also satisfied the other revenue recognition criteria contained in sop  since we have persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
effective october   we entered into an arrangement with our primary depository financial institution under which we delivered two specified upgrades annually with the last specified upgrade occurring in the second quarter of this arrangement included specific pricing for each software upgrade and certain special projects in addition to the contingent deposit based pricing related to the software license  hardware  hardware maintenance  and pcs to each trustee client 
therefore  the software upgrades and special projects are part of a bundled arrangement 
each software upgrade is considered a separate and discrete product and  as we do not sell each software upgrade on a standalone basis  we were unable to establish vsoe of the fair value of the software upgrades 
as a result  the licensed software  software upgrade  special projects and pcs are a combined unit of accounting 
revenue for this combined unit of accounting  when recognized  is included as a component of case management services revenue 
since we did not have vsoe of the fair value of each separate upgrade  we deferred recognition of substantially all revenue under this arrangement until the final upgrade was delivered 
the ongoing costs related to this arrangement were recognized as expense when incurred 
on delivery of the final upgrade during the second quarter of  the only remaining undelivered element was pcs services 
in accordance with sop  on delivery of the final software upgrade  we recognized revenue previously deferred on a proportionate basis over the three year term of the contract 
as the contract terminated september   during we recognized approximately million of revenue which had been deferred as of december  we also provide our trustee clients with certain hardware  such as desktop computers  monitors  and printers  and hardware maintenance 
we retain ownership of all hardware provided and  based on guidance provided in eitf  determining whether an arrangement contains a lease  we account for this hardware as a lease 
as the hardware maintenance arrangement is an executory contract similar to an operating lease  we use guidance related to contingent rentals in operating lease arrangements for hardware maintenance as well as for the hardware lease 
since the payments under all of our arrangements are contingent upon the level of trustee deposits and the delivery of upgrades and other services  there remain important uncertainties regarding the amount of unreimbursable costs yet to be incurred by us  we account for the hardware lease as an operating lease in accordance with sfas  accounting for leases 
therefore  all lease payments  based on the estimated fair value of hardware provided  were accounted for as contingent rentals under eitf issue no 
 accounting for contingent rent and sab topic  which requires that we recognize rental income when the changes in the factor on which the contingent lease payment is based actually occur 
this occurs at the end of each period as we achieved our target when deposits are held at the depository financial institution as  at that time  evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the amount has become fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
this revenue  which is less than ten percent of our total revenue  is included as a component of case management services revenue 
reimbursements our case and document management businesses both have revenue related to the reimbursement of certain costs  primarily postage 
consistent with guidance provided by eitf no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  reimbursed postage and other reimbursable direct costs are recorded gross in the consolidated statement of operations as operating revenue from reimbursed direct costs and as reimbursed direct costs 
share based compensation 
effective january   we began accounting for share based compensation under sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
sfas no 
r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award and to recognize that cost over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
r  during the year ended december  we recognized expense related to share options issued prior to but unvested as of january  as well as expense related to share options issued subsequent to january  for share options issued prior to but unvested as of january   compensation expense was based on the fair value of those share options as calculated using the black scholes option valuation model at the date the share options were issued 
key assumptions for the black scholes option valuation model include expected volatility  expected term of share options granted  the expected risk free interest rate  and the expected dividend rate 
for share options issued during the year ended december   the share options were also valued using the black scholes option valuation models and with key assumptions related to expected volatility  expected term of share options granted  the expected risk free interest rate  and the expected dividend rate 
we estimate our expected volatility based on implied volatilities from traded share options on our stock and on our stock s historical volatility 
we have estimated the expected term of our share options based on the historical exercise pattern of groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior 
the expected risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant 
historically  we have not paid dividends and we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future  accordingly  our expected dividend rate is zero 
we recognize this expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the last separately vesting portion of the award 
due to the numerous assumptions involved in calculating share based compensation expense  the expense recognized in our consolidated financial statements may differ significantly from the value realized by employees on exercise of the share based instruments 
in accordance with the methodology prescribed by sfas r  we do not adjust our recognized compensation expense to reflect these differences 
recognition of share based compensation expense had  and will likely continue to have  a material affect on our direct costs and general and administrative line items within our consolidated statements of operations and also may have a material affect on our deferred income taxes and additional paid in capital line items within our consolidated balance sheets 
adoption of sfas no 
r affects the classification within our consolidated statement of cash flows of certain tax benefits as certain tax benefits formerly classified as an operating cash flow are now classified as a financing cash flow 
to date  the only share based compensation we have issued is share options 
business combination accounting 
we have acquired a number of businesses during the last several years  and we may acquire additional businesses in the future 
business combination accounting  often referred to as purchase accounting  requires us to determine the fair value of all assets acquired  including identifiable intangible assets  and liabilities assumed 
the cost of the acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in amounts equal to the fair value of each asset and liability  and any remaining acquisition cost is classified as goodwill 
this allocation process requires extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows to be generated by the acquired assets 
certain identifiable intangible assets  such as customer lists and covenants not to compete  are amortized on a straight line basis over the intangible asset s estimated useful life 
the estimated useful life of amortizable identifiable intangible assets ranges from one to fourteen years 
goodwill is not amortized 
accordingly  the acquisition cost allocation has had  and will continue to have  a significant impact on our current operating results 
goodwill 
we assess goodwill  which is not subject to amortization  for impairment as of each july and also at any other date when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may exceed their fair value 
this assessment is performed at a reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is a component of a segment that constitutes a business  for which discrete financial information is available  and for which the operating results are regularly reviewed by management 
we develop an estimate of the fair value of each reporting unit  using both a market approach and an income approach 
if potential for impairment exists  the fair value of the reporting unit is subsequently measured against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities  excluding goodwill  to estimate an implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
for each reporting unit  the fair value estimate for our annual assessment was consistent with the fair value estimate for our annual assessment 
a change in events or circumstances  including a decision to hold an asset or group of assets for sale  a change in strategic direction  or a change in the competitive environment could adversely affect the fair value of one or more reporting units 
the estimate of fair value is highly subjective and requires significant judgment 
if we determine that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than the reporting unit s carrying value  then we will recognize an impairment charge 
if goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet becomes impaired during a future period  the resulting impairment charge could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
our recognized goodwill totaled million as of december  identifiable intangible assets 
each period we evaluate whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated useful life of each identifiable intangible asset 
if events and circumstances warrant a change to the estimate of an identifiable intangible asset s remaining useful life  then the remaining carrying amount of the identifiable intangible asset would be amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life 
furthermore  information developed during our annual assessment  or other events and circumstances  may indicate that the carrying value of one or more identifiable intangible assets is not recoverable and its fair value is less than the identifiable intangible asset s carrying value and would result in recognition of an impairment charge 
a change in the estimate of the remaining life of one or more identifiable intangible assets or the impairment of one or more identifiable intangible assets could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
our identifiable intangible assets carrying value  net of amortization  was million as of december  results of operations for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  to enhance comparability of the results for the year ended december  to the prior year  we separately identify the operating results of recently acquired entities  nmatrix  hilsoft  and epiq advisory services collectively  the recently acquired entities  which were not included in our operating results for all or a substantial portion of the prior year 
revenue total revenue from operations of million for the year ended december  represents an approximate million  or  increase compared with million of revenue for the prior year 
total revenue includes operating revenue from reimbursed direct costs  which are presented as a separate line item captioned operating revenue from reimbursed direct costs on our consolidated statement of operations 
while operating revenue from reimbursed direct costs may fluctuate significantly from period to period  these fluctuations have a minimal effect on our income loss from operations as we realize little or no margin from this revenue 
operating revenue before reimbursed direct costs  also presented as a separate line item on our consolidated statement of operations  increased million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the same period in the prior year 
this increase is primarily the result of an approximate million increase in case management revenue combined with an approximate million increase in document management revenue 
all revenue is directly related to a segment and changes in revenue by segment are discussed below 
operating expenses direct cost of services increased approximately million  or to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
this increase is primarily attributable to an approximate million increase in direct costs of services related to our recently acquired entities 
changes by segment are discussed below 
direct cost of bundled software license  software upgrade and postcontract customer support services increased approximately million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year primarily as a result of increased compensation costs 
changes by segment are discussed below 
reimbursed direct costs increased approximately million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
this increase directly corresponds to the increase in operating revenue from reimbursed direct costs 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
approximately million of this increase is attributable to our recently acquired entities 
the remainder of the increase is primarily attributable to the combination of a million increase in compensation expense  primarily related to the recognition of share based compensation expense resulting from the adoption of sfas r  and increases in administrative expenses to support the expansion of our business  including an approximate million increase in travel and promotional expense 
changes by segment are discussed below 
depreciation and software and leasehold amortization expenses increased million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year  primarily as a result of an approximate million increase related to our recently acquired entities 
the remainder of the increase is primarily the result of a million increase in internally developed software amortization due to our continued investment in software development 
changes by segment are discussed below 
amortization of intangibles increased approximately to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year  primarily related to an increase in identifiable intangible assets related to our recently acquired entities 
all expense related to amortization of identifiable intangible assets is directly related to a segment and changes in identifiable intangible amortization expense by segment are discussed below 
acquisition related expenses of million for the year ended december  result from non capitalized expenses for bonuses  legal  accounting and valuation services  and travel incurred in connection with potential and completed transactions compared to million for the prior year 
interest expense interest expense increased million  to million for the year ended december  compared with million of interest expense for the prior year 
this increase primarily relates to an approximate million increase in interest expense related to our credit facility  primarily as a result of an increase in borrowings to finance our november electronic discovery acquisition 
effective tax rate our effective tax rate to record tax expense was for the year ended december  compared with an effective rate to record the tax benefit related to our net loss of for the prior year 
the change in our effective tax rate compared to the prior year s benefit is primarily the result of the effect of nondeductible expenses on pre tax income in versus a pre tax loss in our tax rate is higher than the statutory federal rate of primarily due to state taxes 
several of our subsidiaries operate in new york city and are subject to state and local tax rates which are higher than the tax rates assessed by other jurisdictions where we operate 
deferred revenue recognized during was related primarily to lower tax rate jurisdictions leading to a lower effective tax rate than what we expect in the future 
net income loss we had net income of million for the year ended december  compared with a net loss of million for the prior year 
this change is primarily the result of an million increase in revenue from case management bundled software license  software upgrade and postcontract customer support services  partly offset by million in tax expense for the year ended december  compared with a tax benefit of million for the prior year  a million increase in depreciation and software and intangible asset amortization expenses  a million increase in interest expense  and a million increase in share based compensation expense 
the increase in case management bundled revenue  as more fully explained under the case management segment caption below  primarily related to the recognition during of revenue which was deferred beginning in october the change in tax expense is largely the result the recognition of income during compared with a loss during the prior year 
the increase in depreciation and software and intangible asset amortization expense is largely attributable to the depreciation and amortization of assets acquired by acquisition during and  primarily assets related to our electronic discovery acquisition 
the increase in interest expense is primarily the result of additional bank debt incurred to finance these acquisitions 
the increase in share based compensation expense resulted from the adoption as of january   of the sfas r  which resulted in recognition of expense related to issued and unvested stock options 
business segments the following management discussion and analysis is presented on a basis consistent with our segment disclosure contained in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
case management segment case management operating revenue before reimbursed direct costs increased approximately million to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
our recently acquired entities accounted for approximately million of the increase 
the remainder of the increase is primarily attributable to an million increase in revenue from case management bundled software license  software upgrades and postcontract customer support services 
this increase primarily relates to a bundled arrangement which began october  and ended september  as of december   we had deferred recognition of million in revenue pending delivery of a final specified software upgrade under the contract provisions 
as a result of this final delivery  we recognized the million of previously deferred revenue during additionally  we recognized  through the end of the arrangement  revenue for bundled software license  software upgrades and postcontract customer support services delivered during we also recognized revenue related to software licenses and postcontract customer support services delivered under a new arrangement  which commenced october  these increases in revenue were partly offset by an approximate million decline in professional fees  primarily as a result of fewer class action client retentions 
case management direct costs  general and administrative expenses  and depreciation and software amortization increased million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the same period in the prior year 
our recently acquired entities accounted for approximately million of the increase 
the remainder of this increase is primarily attributable to an approximate million increase in outside service costs 
our case management cost structure is relatively stable and generally does not fluctuate materially with changes in operating revenues 
amortization of case management s identifiable intangible assets increased to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
this increase is primarily attributable to the amortization related to the identifiable intangible assets acquired in the nmatrix acquisition 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements provides a summary of the total identified intangible assets and the scheduled amortization expense related to these identified intangible assets over the next five years 
document management segment document management operating revenue before reimbursed direct costs increased approximately million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in operating revenue before reimbursed direct costs related to recently acquired entities  partly offset by a decline in noticing services primarily as a result of fewer class action client retentions combined with a decrease in our bankruptcy noticing requirements 
document management revenues  including revenue related to media campaigns and services  can fluctuate materially from period to period based on clients business requirements 
document management direct costs  general and administrative expenses  and depreciation and software amortization increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
this increase primarily results from an approximate million increase in costs related to recently acquired entities  partly offset by an approximate decrease in compensation expense related to reduced staffing 
our document management cost structure is more variable than case management and will fluctuate based on document management business requirements delivered 
amortization of document management s identifiable intangible assets increased to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
this increase is primarily attributable to amortization related to intangible assets acquired in the hilsoft acquisition 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements provides a summary of the total identified intangible assets and the scheduled amortization expense related to these identified intangible assets over the next five years 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  consolidated results revenue total revenue from operations of million for the year ended december  represents an approximate million  or  increase compared with million of revenue for the prior year 
total revenue includes operating revenue from reimbursed direct costs  which are presented as a separate line item captioned operating revenue from reimbursed direct costs on our consolidated statement of operations 
while operating revenue from reimbursed direct costs may fluctuate significantly from period to period  these fluctuations have a minimal effect on our income loss from operations as we realize little or no margin from this revenue 
operating revenue before reimbursed direct costs  also presented as a separate line item on our consolidated statement of operations  increased million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the same period in the prior year 
all revenue is directly related to a segment and changes in revenue by segment are discussed below 
operating expenses direct cost of services decreased approximately million  or to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
excluding our subsidiaries acquired during  direct costs of services decreased million  or approximately  compared with the prior year 
this decrease is primarily the result of a decrease in cost of advertising 
changes by segment are discussed below 
direct cost of bundled software license  software upgrade and postcontract customer support services increased approximately million to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year primarily as a result of increased compensation costs 
changes by segment are discussed below 
reimbursed direct costs increased approximately to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
this increase directly corresponds to the increase in operating revenue from reimbursed direct costs 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
excluding our subsidiaries acquired during  general and administrative expenses increased million  or approximately  compared with the prior year 
this increase primarily results from the increase in the scope and complexity of our business  and is primarily the result of increases in compensation and related expenses  travel  and professional services 
changes by segment are discussed below 
depreciation and software and leasehold amortization expenses increased million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
excluding our subsidiaries acquired during  depreciation and software and leasehold amortization expenses increased million  or approximately  compared with the prior year primarily as a result of increased software amortization 
changes by segment are discussed below 
amortization of identifiable intangible assets decreased million to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
all expense related to amortization of identifiable intangible assets is directly related to a segment and changes in identifiable intangible amortization expense by segment are discussed below 
acquisition related expenses of million for the year ended december  and million for the prior year result from non capitalized expenses for bonuses  legal  accounting and valuation services  and travel incurred in connection with potential and completed transactions 
interest expense interest expense increased million  to million for the year ended december  compared with million of interest expense for the prior year 
this increase related to various components variable interest expense related to our credit facilities and fixed interest expense related to our convertible debt increased million to million during the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year primarily as a result of an increase in our variable interest rate  partly offset by a decrease in weighted average borrowings outstanding during the year 
amortization of loan fees related to our credit facilities and our convertible debt offering decreased million to million during the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
this decrease is primarily a result of amortization related to a short term subordinated borrowing under the credit facility used to finance the acquisition of poorman douglas in january all fees related to this subordinated borrowing were amortized during our convertible debt facility includes a provision allowing the convertible debt holders to extend the debt maturity from three years to six years 
under sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  this provision is accounted for as an embedded option 
at inception  the embedded option was valued at million and the convertible debt balance was reduced by the same amount 
the convertible debt accretes approximately million each quarter such that  at the end of three years  the convertible debt balance will total million 
the embedded option must be revalued at each period end based on the probability weighted discounted cash flows related to the additional interest rate payments which would be made if the convertible debt maturity is extended an additional three years 
while the changes in fair value of the embedded option and carrying value of the convertible debt do not affect our current cash flow  the aggregate of these changes in value is accounted for as a current income or expense item and is included on our accompanying consolidated statement of operations as a component of interest expense 
during the year ended december   we recognized expense related to the convertible debt accretion and change in value of the embedded option of million  compared with million of such expense in the prior year 
if the embedded option is eventually exercised  the value assigned to the embedded option will be amortized to income as a reduction to our convertible debt interest expense over the periods payments are made 
if the option is not exercised by some or all convertible debt holders  any remaining related value assigned to the embedded option will be recognized as a gain during that period 
debt extinguishment during  we replaced the senior portion of the credit facility used to finance the poorman douglas transaction with our keybank credit facility 
as a result  during the year ended december   we recognized a million charge for the write off of loan fees related to the terminated credit facility 
we did not recognize any debt extinguishment expense during effective tax rate our effective tax rate to record the tax benefit related to our loss from continuing operations increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the change in our effective tax benefit rate compared to the prior year is primarily the result of discrete events  including characterization of the loss from disposal of our discontinued operations from a business loss to a non business loss and an increase in our research and expenditure credit 
our tax benefit rate is higher than the statutory federal rate of primarily due to state taxes 
our corporate restructuring and electronic discovery businesses operate primarily in new york city and are subject to state and local tax rates which are higher than the tax rates assessed by other jurisdictions where we operate 
net loss our net loss decreased to a million net loss for the year ended december  compared with a million net loss for the prior year 
this decrease in our net loss was primarily the result of an million increase in revenue  primarily resulting from the inclusion of revenue from our electronic discovery business acquired during november  and a million decrease in direct costs  primarily resulting from a decrease in media campaign and advertising direct costs 
this decrease in our net loss was partly offset by a million increase in our general and administrative expenses  a million decrease in our tax benefit primarily resulting from the reduced pre tax loss  and a million decrease of income from operations of our discontinued infrastructure segment compared with business segments the following management discussion and analysis is presented on a basis consistent with our segment disclosure contained in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
case management segment case management operating revenue before reimbursed direct costs increased approximately to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
our electronic discovery business  which was acquired on november   accounted for approximately million of the increase in operating revenue before reimbursed direct costs 
the remainder of the increase is primarily attributable to a million increase in class action operating revenues before reimbursed direct costs resulting from the timing of several large cases and a million increase resulting from a net increase in bankruptcy professional services 
case management direct costs  general and administrative expenses  and depreciation and software amortization increased million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the same period in the prior year 
our electronic discovery business  which was acquired on november   accounted for approximately million of the increase 
exclusive of electronic discovery  direct and administrative expenses  including depreciation and software amortization  increased by million  or approximately 
this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in reimbursed expenses and expenses related to the expansion of our bankruptcy service offerings 
our case management cost structure is relatively stable and generally does not fluctuate materially with changes in operating revenues 
amortization of case management s identifiable intangible assets decreased million to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
this decrease is primarily attributable to certain intangible assets acquired in the bsi acquisition that became fully amortized during  largely offset by an increase in amortization related to intangible assets acquired in the nmatrix acquisition 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements provides a summary of the total identified intangible assets and the scheduled amortization expense related to these identified intangible assets over the next five years 
document management segment document management operating revenue before reimbursed direct costs decreased approximately million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
this decrease is primarily attributable to a decline in media campaign and advertising services 
our media campaign and advertising services are primarily connected with class action and bankruptcy customers for whom we provide case administration services 
media campaign and advertising services vary significantly depending on the characteristics of the case 
generally  cases in which the specific identity of members of the plaintiff class is unknown will require significantly more media campaign and advertising services than cases in which the specific identity of the members of the plaintiff class is known 
during  we had several large cases in which the specific identity of the members of the plaintiff class was unknown and  therefore  required extensive media campaign and advertising services 
during  the identities of the members of the plaintiff class on our large cases were known and  therefore  did not require extensive media campaign and advertising services 
document management operating revenue from reimbursed direct costs of million for the year ended december  increased approximately compared with the same period in the prior year 
operating revenue from reimbursed direct costs has little or no margin and  accordingly  this increase in operating revenue from reimbursed direct costs did not have a material effect on our income from operations 
document management revenues  including revenues related to media campaign and services  can fluctuate materially from period to period based on clients business requirements 
document management direct costs  general and administrative expenses  and depreciation and software amortization decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
this decrease primarily results from a decrease in cost of media campaign and advertising  related to the decline in media campaign and advertising service revenue discussed above  partly offset by an increase in reimbursed expenses  the inclusion of hilsoft operating expenses  and an increase in expenses paid to third parties for production services 
our document management cost structure is more variable than case management and will fluctuate based on document management business requirements delivered 
amortization of document management s identifiable intangible assets decreased million to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
this decrease is primarily attributable to certain intangible assets acquired in the bsi acquisition that became fully amortized during  partly offset by an increase in amortization related to intangible assets acquired in the hilsoft acquisition 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements provides a summary of the total identified intangible assets and the scheduled amortization expense related to these identified intangible assets over the next five years 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities during the year ended december   our operating activities provided net cash of million 
the primary sources of cash from operating activities was net income of million  adjusted for million of non cash charges and credits  primarily deferred tax expense of million  share based compensation of million  and depreciation and amortization expense of million 
these sources of cash were partly offset by a million net use of cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the most significant change in operating assets and liabilities was a million decrease in deferred revenue  primarily as a result of recognition of previously deferred amounts related to a three year arrangement that ended september  this use of cash was partly offset by a million decrease in income taxes refundable  primarily as a result of the receipt of refunds due to us  a million increase in accounts payable and other liabilities  primarily as a result of the recognition of lease expense in excess of cash lease payments and normal fluctuations  and a million decrease in trade accounts receivable 
trade accounts receivable will fluctuate from period to period depending on the timing of collections 
changes in operating assets and liabilities as a direct result of assets acquired or liabilities assumed have been excluded from our consolidated statements of cash flows 
however  subsequent to acquisition  cash flows related to these acquired assets and assumed liabilities are reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
for example  accounts receivable and accounts payable acquired or assumed as a part of the transaction are not reflected  respectively  as a use or source of cash 
however  the subsequent collection or payment  respectively  of accounts receivable and accounts payable acquired or assumed as a part of the transaction are reflected as an operating source or use of cash  respectively 
investing activities during the year ended december   we used cash of approximately million to purchase property and equipment 
our property and equipment purchases consisted primarily of computer related hardware to support our electronic discovery and bankruptcy businesses 
enhancements to our existing software and development of new software is essential to our continued growth and we used cash of approximately million to fund internal costs related to development of software for which technological feasibility has been established 
we also used approximately million of cash to partly fund an acquisition 
we believe that cash generated from operations will be adequate to fund our anticipated property  equipment and software spending over the next year 
financing activities during the year ended december   we paid approximately million as a principal reduction on our senior term loan  we paid million as a principal reduction on deferred acquisition debt  we paid million due on capital leases  and we repaid  net of borrowings  million of our senior revolving loan 
this financing use of cash was partly offset by million of net proceeds from stock issued in connection with the exercise of employee share options 
as a result of the adoption of sfas r  we also classify a portion of the tax benefit  referred to as excess tax benefit  that we realize on exercise of employee share options as a financing cash flow 
the effect of this accounting change was to recognize million of excess tax benefit as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow 
as of december   our borrowings consisted of million from the contingent convertible subordinated notes including the fair value of the embedded option  million under our senior term loan  million under our senior revolving loan  and approximately million of obligations related to capitalized leases and deferred acquisition price 
our convertible debt of million matures on june  the convertible notes will require the use of cash at their scheduled maturity in june if the note holders do not extend the maturity of the notes  at their option  and do not convert the notes into shares of our common stock 
if the maturity of the notes is extended or if they are converted into shares of our common stock prior to the scheduled maturity of those notes  then there will be no cash requirements associated with those convertible notes  other than the regular payment of interest on the outstanding notes 
we anticipate continuing to pay interest on the notes from cash flow from operations  and we anticipate paying the principal of any maturing notes from the sources discussed below 
as of december   significant financial covenants  all as defined within our credit facility agreement  include a leverage ratio not to exceed to  a senior leverage ratio not to exceed to  a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than to  and a current ratio of not less than to 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants in our credit facility  including all financial covenants 
we may pursue acquisitions in the future 
covenants contained in our credit facility and in our convertible notes may limit our ability to consummate an acquisition 
pursuant to the terms of our credit facility  we generally cannot incur indebtedness outside the credit facility with the exception of capital leases and additional subordinated debt  with a limit of million of aggregate subordinated debt 
furthermore  for any acquisition we must be able to demonstrate that  on a pro forma basis  we would be in compliance with our covenants during the four quarters prior to the acquisition and we must obtain bank permission for any acquisition for which cash consideration exceeds million or total consideration exceeds million 
we believe that the funds generated from operations plus our existing cash resources and amounts available under our senior revolving loan facility will be sufficient over the next months  and for the foreseeable future thereafter  to finance currently anticipated working capital requirements  software expenditures  property and equipment expenditures  common share price protection payments  if any  related to common shares issued in conjunction with the acquisition of our electronic discovery business  principal payments due under the credit facility  deferred acquisition price agreements and capital leases  interest payments due on our outstanding borrowings  and payments for other contractual obligations 
as noted above  if the holders of our outstanding convertible notes do not either i extend the maturity of those notes  at the option of the note holders  or ii convert the notes into shares of our common stock in accordance with the terms of the notes  those notes  in the outstanding principal amount of million  will mature on june  if those notes mature at that time  our cash flow from operations from the date of this report through that maturity date is not anticipated to be sufficient to pay those notes after the uses of anticipated cash flow from operations to meet our other normal uses of cash described above 
management believes we could increase liquidity to fund payment of these notes through a restructuring our credit facility  through the disposition of non strategic assets  or through the issuance of debt or equity securities 
off balance sheet arrangements although we generally do not utilize off balance sheet arrangements in our operations  we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business 
our operating lease obligations are disclosed below under contractual obligations and also in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as discussed more fully in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we guaranteed the price for approximately million shares of our common stock issued in connection with the acquisition of nmatrix 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments  excluding periodic interest payments  as of december  payments due by period contractual obligation total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term obligations and future accretion employment agreements capital lease obligations operating leases total a portion of the bsi  hilsoft  and epiq advisory services purchase prices were paid in the form of non interest bearing notes or below market rate notes  which were discounted using an imputed rate of   and  respectively  per annum 
the discounts are accreted over the life of the note and each period s accretion is added to the principal of the respective note 
the amount in the above contractual obligation table includes both the notes principal  as reflected on our december  consolidated balance sheet  and all future accretion 
if certain revenue objectives are satisfied  we will make additional payments  not to exceed million  over the next five years to the former owners of hilsoft 
such payments  if any  are not included in the above contractual obligation table 
as of december   we had not made or accrued any additional payments 
convertible debt is included at stated value of the principal redemption and excludes adjustments related to the embedded option  which will not be paid in cash 
any conversion to our common stock of part or all of the convertible debt will reduce our cash obligation related to the convertible debt 
in conjunction with acquisitions  we have entered into employment agreements with certain key employees of the acquired companies 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas permits the measurement of specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value on a contract by contract basis  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period 
we do not anticipate that adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements  sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
fas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
management is still evaluating the impact  if any  that the adoption of sfas will have on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 fin accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of sfas  accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize  measure  present  and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
under fin  tax positions shall initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities 
such tax positions shall initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts 
fin also revises disclosure requirements to include an annual tabular rollforward of unrecognized tax benefits 
the provisions of this interpretation are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will be required to apply the provisions of fin to all tax positions upon initial adoption with any cumulative effect adjustment to be recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings 
we are currently evaluating what effect the adoption of fin will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued staff position no 
fas r  amendment of fasb staff position r fsp r 
fsp r  which amends fsp r  addresses instruments originally issued as employee compensation and later modified solely to reflect an equity restructuring that occurs when the holders are no longer employees 
in that situation  no change in the recognition or measurement due to change in classification of those instruments will result if i there is no increase in the fair value of the award  or an antidilution provision is not added to the terms of the award in contemplation of an equity restructuring  and ii all holders of the same class of equity instruments are treated in the same manner 
the guidance in fsp r is to be applied in the first reporting period beginning after october  we do not anticipate that adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued staff position no 
fas r  technical corrections of fasb statement no 
r fsp r 
fsp r was issued to make several technical corrections to sfas r 
these include exemption for non public entities from disclosing the aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding fully vested share options  revision to the computation of the minimum compensation cost that must be recognized  indication that at the date the illustrative awards were no longer probable of vesting  any previously recognized compensation cost should have been reversed  and changes to the definition of short term inducement to exclude an offer to settle an award 
the guidance in fsp r is effective in the first reporting period beginning after october  early application is permitted in periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued 
we do not anticipate that adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices  interest rates  indices  volatilities  correlations or other market factors  such as liquidity  will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments 
our convertible debt and credit facility borrowings create market risks for us 
we do not actively manage these market risks 
during  we issued million of convertible notes with a fixed interest rate 
while we do not have cash flow risk related to this instrument  the instrument does contain an embedded option related to the right of security holders to extend the maturity of the convertible notes which creates an earnings risk 
a increase in our stock value would result in a million increase in the fair value of the embedded option and a corresponding decrease in pre tax earnings 
a decrease in our stock value would result in a million decrease in the fair value of the embedded option and a corresponding increase in pre tax earnings 
the estimated changes in fair value were calculated using a pricing model that incorporates assumptions regarding future volatility  interest rates and credit risk 
at december   we have borrowings outstanding under a credit facility 
interest on borrowings under our credit facility is computed at a variable rate based on the libor rate and the prime rate and results in a market risk related to interest rates 
a increase or decrease in the libor rate and the prime rate would increase or decrease  respectively  our annual pre tax interest expense on variable rate borrowings outstanding as of december  by approximately million
