item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition  the changes in our financial condition and our results of operations 
our discussion is organized as follows recent developments 
this section provides a general description of recent events and significant transactions that we believe are important in understanding our financial condition and results of operations 
overview 
this section provides a general description of our business and operating history 
critical accounting policies and estimates 
this section contains a discussion of the accounting policies that we believe are important to our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application 
in addition  all of our significant accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies and estimates  are summarized in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
results of operations 
this section provides an analysis of our results of operations presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations by comparing the results for the year ended december  to the results for the year ended december  and comparing the results for the year ended december  to the results for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources 
this section provides an analysis of our cash flows and a discussion of our outstanding debt and commitments  both firm and contingent  that existed as of december  included in the discussion of outstanding debt is a discussion of our financial capacity to fund our future commitments and a discussion of other financing arrangements 
recent developments on march   we announced positive interim antibody results from our ongoing double blind  placebo controlled randomized phase trial of riquent 
analyses of interim antibody data indicate that patients treated with mg or mg per week doses of riquent had greater reductions in antibodies to dsdna than patients treated with mg per week or placebo 
the results showed a significant dose response when comparing all riquent treated patients to placebo treated patients p  and each riquent dose group to the placebo dose group p for mg  p for mg and mg 
on february   we announced that we had made continued progress in enrolling patients in our phase clinical trial of riquent in that we had enrolled patients in the study and clinical trial sites were open to enroll patients  including newly added sites in europe and mexico 
in addition  we also announced that following recent discussions with the fda  we have implemented several enhancements to further strengthen the phase study  which remains under special protocol assessment 
these enhancements include focus on higher doses all new patients entering the study will be randomized in equal numbers to receive weekly doses of either mg or mg of riquent or placebo  with no further patients randomized to the mg dose group 
increase sample size the study sample size is increased from approximately to approximately patients  which is expected to increase the likelihood of achieving a statistically significant outcome for the individual dose groups when compared with placebo as well as overall 

table of contents broaden analysis of patient population the primary endpoint will be assessed in all patients and will no longer be restricted to the high affinity subpopulation 
we believe that the increased binding capability of higher doses will eliminate the need for an affinity measurement prior to treatment 
combine current studies to increase efficiency and enhance the quality of data  we also combined the phase clinical pharmacology study with the phase study so that riquent blood levels will be collected in the same patient population as the definitive efficacy data 
on january   we announced that we would initiate a multi dose clinical study of riquent in lupus patients to evaluate the ability of higher doses of riquent to further reduce antibodies to dsdna 
this study is part of our overall clinical development program of riquent  which includes the ongoing phase clinical benefit trial to evaluate the use of riquent in preventative and acute settings 
subsequently  in february  this phase clinical pharmacology study was combined with the phase study 
on january   we announced that we had regained compliance with the nasdaq stock market minimum bid price rule and that we were eligible to remain listed on the nasdaq global market 
on march   we announced that deirdre y 
gillespie  md was appointed to serve as our new president and chief executive officer following the resignation of steven b 
engle on march  we also announced that our board of directors had appointed craig r 
smith  md  a current independent director  to serve as chairman of the board 
on june   we announced that our maa had been accepted for review by the emea for potential approval to market riquent in the eu 
the maa was filed with the emea on march  the emea s review of the maa would follow its centralized marketing authorization procedure 
riquent has already received orphan medicinal product designation in europe  which will provide years of market exclusivity from the date of the eu s authorization  if any 
on july   we announced that michael j 
b 
tansey  md  md had joined the company as chief medical officer on a part time basis  whereby of his time is devoted to his position with the company 
effective december   dr 
tansey became a full time employee  assuming the title of executive vice president and chief medical officer 
on august   we announced that we had reactivated enrollment in our phase trial of riquent 
on september   we announced that we had made considerable progress on our phase trial of riquent in that we had added new clinical trial sites able to screen and enroll patients for a total of sites in the united states and in asia 
on october   we announced that we had requested the withdrawal of our maa 
in a preliminary assessment of the maa  the emea reviewers indicated that additional clinical data would be needed prior to potential approval 
based on our review of the assessment  we believe that the ongoing clinical studies of riquent should provide the necessary data  however  the data will not be available within the timeframe that the emea regulations allow for the review of the current riquent application 
therefore  we decided to withdraw the current application  and plan to refile the maa after the completion of the ongoing clinical trials  if they are successful 
on november   we announced that we had made further progress in enrolling patients and opening sites for our phase clinical trial of riquent 
as of november  patients had been enrolled in the study  more than additional patients were in screening for potential enrollment and we had activated clinical trial sites  including newly added sites in europe 

table of contents overview since our inception in may  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the research and development of technology and potential drugs to treat antibody mediated diseases 
we have never generated any revenue from product sales and have relied on public and private offerings of securities  revenue from collaborative agreements  equipment financings and interest income on invested cash balances for our working capital 
we expect that our research and development expenses will increase significantly in the future 
for example  we are conducting and expanding a phase clinical trial of riquent which the fda has indicated appears to satisfy the requirement that we conduct an additional randomized  double blind study 
this study is expected to involve approximately patients and take two to three years to complete 
therefore  we expect to expend substantial amounts of capital resources for the clinical development and manufacturing of riquent 
we may also devote substantial additional capital resources to establish commercial scale manufacturing capabilities and to market and sell potential products 
these expenses may be incurred prior to or after any regulatory approvals that we may receive 
in addition  our research and development expenses may increase if we initiate any additional clinical studies of riquent or if we increase our activities related to any additional drug candidates 
we will need additional funds to finance our future operations 
our activities to date are not as broad in depth or scope as the activities we may undertake in the future  and our historical operations and the financial information included in this report are not necessarily indicative of our future operating results or financial condition 
we expect our net loss to fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing of expenses incurred and the revenues earned from any potential collaborative arrangements that we may establish 
some of these fluctuations may be significant 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
our business is subject to significant risks  including  but not limited to  the risks inherent in research and development efforts  including clinical trials  the lengthy  expensive and uncertain process of seeking regulatory approvals  the need for additional financing or a collaborative partner  uncertainties associated with both obtaining and enforcing patents  the potential enforcement of the patent rights of others against us  uncertainties regarding government reforms regarding product pricing and reimbursement levels  technological change  competition  manufacturing uncertainties  our lack of marketing experience  the uncertainty of receiving future revenue from product sales or other sources such as collaborative relationships  and the uncertainty of future profitability 
even if our product candidates appear promising at an early stage of development  they may not reach the market for numerous reasons  including the possibilities that the products will be ineffective or unsafe during clinical trials  will fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals  will be difficult to manufacture on a large scale  will be uneconomical to market or will be precluded from commercialization by the proprietary rights of third parties or competing products 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to patent costs and clinical regulatory expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements see note to our consolidated financial statements 
impairment and useful lives of long lived assets we regularly review our long lived assets for impairment 
our long lived assets include costs incurred to file our patent applications 
we evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets by measuring the carrying amount of the assets against the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with them 
at the time such evaluations indicate that the future undiscounted cash flows of certain long lived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets  the assets are adjusted to their fair values 
the estimation of the undiscounted future cash flows 
table of contents associated with long lived assets requires judgment and assumptions that could differ materially from the actual results 
while we believe our current and historical operating and cash flow losses are indicators of impairment  we believe the future cash flows to be received from the long lived assets will exceed the assets carrying value 
we have recognized approximately million in impairment losses for each of the years ended december  and there were no impairment losses recognized for the year ended december  costs related to successful patent applications are amortized using the straight line method over the lesser of the remaining useful life of the related technology or the remaining patent life  commencing on the date the patent is issued 
legal costs and expenses incurred in connection with pending patent applications have been capitalized 
we expense all costs related to abandoned patent applications 
if we elect to abandon any of our currently issued or unissued patents  the related expense could be material to our results of operations for the period of abandonment 
the estimation of useful lives for long lived assets requires judgment and assumptions that could differ materially from the actual results 
in addition  our results of operations could be materially impacted if we begin amortizing the costs related to unissued patents 
accrued clinical regulatory expenses we review and accrue clinical trial and regulatory related expenses based on work performed  which relies on estimates of total costs incurred based on patient enrollment  completion of studies and other events 
we follow this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the costs applicable to various stages of a clinical trial can be made 
accrued clinical regulatory costs are subject to revisions as trials progress to completion 
revisions are charged to expense in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
historically  revisions have not resulted in material changes to research and development costs  however a modification in the protocol of a clinical trial or cancellation of a trial could result in a charge to our results of operations 
share based compensation we adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
r  share based payments sfas r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the application of the accounting standard as of january   the first day of our fiscal year 
our consolidated statement of operations as of and for the year ended december  reflects the impact of sfas r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our consolidated statements of operations for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas r 
share based compensation expense recognized under sfas r for the year ended december  was approximately million 
as of december   there was approximately million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested share based payment awards granted under all equity compensation plans 
total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures 
we currently expect to recognize the remaining unrecognized compensation cost over a weighted average period of years 
additional share based compensation expense for any new share based payment awards granted after december  under all equity compensation plans cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on  among other matters  the amounts of share based payment awards granted in the future 
prior to january   we had adopted the disclosure only provision of sfas no 
 accounting and disclosure of stock based compensation sfas 
accordingly  we had not previously recognized compensation expense  except for compensation expense related to stock options granted to consultants and restricted stock granted to certain members of management 
had we recognized compensation expense in accordance with sfas for the year ended december  and  our net loss would have increased by approximately million and approximately million  respectively  or and  respectively  per basic and diluted share 
new accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings 

table of contents sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently assessing the impact of sfas on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in september  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
sab addresses the process and diversity in practice of quantifying financial statement misstatements resulting in the potential build up of improper amounts on the balance sheet 
sab is effective for annual periods ending after november  the adoption of sab did not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position as of and for the year ended december  in september  fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the changes to current practice resulting from the application of sfas relate to the definition of fair value  the methods used to measure fair value  and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we currently do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in june  fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin provides guidance on the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosures  and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and is required to be adopted by us in fiscal we are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas changed the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principles and changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition methods 
the adoption of sfas did not affect our consolidated results of operations and financial condition as of and for the year ended december  its effects on future periods will depend on the nature and significance of any future accounting changes subject to sfas results of operations years ended december   and research and development expense 
our research and development expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the increase in research and development expenses in from resulted primarily from an increase in riquent related drug production and clinical trial expenses of approximately million 
in addition  the increase was due to share based compensation expense recorded in connection with the adoption of sfas r of approximately million and an increase in riquent related consulting expenses of approximately million 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in termination benefits  mainly relating to severance  of approximately million that was recorded in in connection with the termination of research and development personnel  and the savings in salaries and related expenses as a result of this reduction in personnel 
our research and development expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million in the decrease in research and development expenses in from resulted primarily from a reduction in expenses related to the purchase of raw materials for the production of riquent of approximately million and a reduction in consulting and professional services of approximately million due to a decrease in activities related to the development of riquent 
also contributing to these decreases were the cost savings related to our march restructuring 

table of contents research and development expense of million for the year ended december  consisted of million for lupus research and development related expense and million for ssao research and development related expense 
total lupus research and development expense consisted primarily of salaries and other costs related to manufacturing  clinical and research personnel  riquent related drug production and clinical trial expenses  fees for consulting and professional outside services and depreciation expense 
total ssao research and development expense consisted primarily of salaries and other costs related to research and development personnel  research supplies  rent and lease expense  depreciation expense and fees for pharmacology  toxicology and other ssao related studies 
we expect that our research and development expense will increase significantly in the future 
for example  we are conducting and expanding a clinical trial of riquent that the fda has indicated appears to satisfy the requirement that we conduct an additional randomized  double blind study 
this study is expected to involve approximately patients and take two to three years to complete 
as patient enrollment expands in our phase trial as modified  our expenses for the manufacturing of riquent will also increase 
additionally  our research and development expenses may increase significantly if we initiate any additional clinical studies of riquent or if we increase our activities related to the development of additional drug candidates 
general and administrative expense 
our general and administrative expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the increase in general and administrative expense in from resulted primarily from share based compensation expense recorded in connection with the adoption of sfas r of approximately million 
the increase was also due to the expense recorded in the first quarter of for severance paid to the former chairman and chief executive officer of approximately million and an increase in general corporate consulting and professional outside services of approximately million 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in termination benefits  mainly relating to severance  of approximately million that was recorded in in connection with the termination of general and administrative personnel  and the savings in salaries and related expenses as a result of this reduction in personnel 
our general and administrative expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million in the decrease in general and administrative expense in from resulted primarily from a reduction in consulting fees for pre marketing and other general corporate activities of approximately million 
this decrease was partially offset by the termination benefits recorded in connection with the march restructuring noted above 
general and administrative expense will increase in the future to support our ongoing clinical trials as patient enrollment and the manufacturing of riquent increases 
additionally  general and administrative expense may increase in the future if there is an increase in research and development or commercialization activities 
interest income and expense 
our interest income increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the increase in interest income in was due to higher average balances of cash and short term investments and higher average interest rates on our investments as compared to our interest income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for due to higher average interest rates on our investments and higher average balances of cash and short term investments as compared to interest expense was comparable for the years ended december  and december  interest expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million in the decrease in interest expense in as compared to was due to lower principal balances on outstanding notes payable obligations because there were no new debt obligations entered into in net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards 
as of december   we had available net operating loss carryforwards and research tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  for federal income tax purposes  which will begin to expire in approximately million of the federal net operating loss carryforward expired in and approximately million of the federal research tax credit carryforward expired in in addition  approximately million of the federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in unless utilized and approximately million of the federal research tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 
table of contents unless utilized 
as of december   we had available net operating loss carryforwards and research tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  for california income tax purposes  which will begin to expire in unless utilized 
approximately million of the california net operating loss carryforward is set to expire in unless utilized 
pursuant to sections and of the internal revenue code  annual use of our net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards may be limited if a cumulative change in ownership of more than occurs within a three year period 
liquidity and capital resources from inception through december   we have incurred a cumulative net loss of approximately million and have financed our operations through public and private offerings of securities  revenues from collaborative agreements  equipment financings and interest income on invested cash balances 
from inception through december   we had raised million in net proceeds from sales of equity securities 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  as compared to million as of december  our working capital as of december  was million  as compared to million as of december  the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments resulted from the use of our financial resources to fund our manufacturing and clinical trial activities  research and development efforts  and for other general corporate purposes 
we invest our cash in united states government backed securities  debt instruments of entities with strong credit ratings and money market funds 
as of december   we classified all of our investments as available for sale securities because we expect to sell them in order to support our current operations regardless of their maturity dates 
as of december   available for sale securities and cash equivalents of million have stated maturity dates of one year or less and million have maturity dates after one year 
securities that have a maturity date greater than one year have their interest rate reset periodically within time periods not exceeding days 
as of december   approximately million of equipment million net of depreciation is financed under notes payable obligations 
in december  we entered into a credit facility to fund equipment purchases up to million until the end of the second quarter of in addition  we lease our office and laboratory facilities and certain equipment under operating leases 
we have also entered into non cancelable purchase commitments for an aggregate of million with third party manufacturers of materials to be used in the production of riquent 
we intend to use our current financial resources to fund our obligations under these purchase commitments 
in the future  we may increase our investments in property and equipment if we expand our research and development and manufacturing facilities and capabilities 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  long term debt obligations include interest 
payment due by period in thousands less than more than total year years years years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total we intend to use our financial resources to fund the current clinical studies of riquent  possible future clinical trials  manufacturing activities  research and development efforts and for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
the amounts that we actually spend for each purpose may vary significantly depending on a number of factors  including the results from current and future clinical trials  the continued analysis of the clinical trial data of riquent  the outcome of our meetings with regulatory authorities  the timing of any regulatory applications and approvals  and technological developments 
expenditures also will depend on any establishment of collaborative arrangements and contract research as well as the availability of other funding or financings 
we anticipate that our existing cash  cash investments and the interest earned thereon  will be sufficient to fund our operations as currently planned through at least december  this projection is based on the assumption that we do not raise any additional funds  either through the sale of additional securities or a collaborative agreement with a 
table of contents corporate partner and that we do not engage in any significant commercialization activities or significant activities in our other research programs 
we will continually evaluate our planned activities 
if we do not raise any additional funds in  we may take one or more significant cost reducing measures including reducing our workforce and or suspending the enrollment of additional patients into the current phase trial 
any significant change in our planned activities or in the assumptions underlying our cash projection referred to above could result in a change to such cash projection 
we have no current means of generating cash flow from operations 
our lead drug candidate  riquent  will not generate revenues  if at all  until it has received regulatory approval and has been successfully manufactured  marketed and sold 
this process  if completed  will take a significant amount of time 
our other drug candidates are much less developed than riquent 
there can be no assurance that our product development efforts with respect to riquent or any other drug candidate will be successfully completed  that required regulatory approvals will be obtained or that any product  if introduced  will be successfully marketed or achieve commercial acceptance 
accordingly  we must continue to rely on outside sources of financing to meet our capital needs for the foreseeable future 
we will continue to seek capital through any number of means  including by issuing our equity securities and by establishing one or more collaborative arrangements 
however  there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all  and our negotiating position in capital raising efforts may worsen as we continue to use existing resources or if the development of riquent is delayed or terminated 
there is also no assurance that we will be able to enter into further collaborative relationships 
in the future  it is possible that we will not have adequate resources to support continuation of our business activities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our excess cash in interest bearing investment grade securities which we sell from time to time to support our current operations 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions or transactions in any material fashion 
although the investment grade securities that we hold are subject to changes in the financial standing of the issuer of such securities  we do not believe that we are subject to any material risks arising from the maturity dates of the debt instruments or changes in interest rates because the interest rates of the securities in which we invest that have a maturity date greater than one year are reset periodically within time periods not exceeding days 
we currently do not invest in any securities that are materially and directly affected by foreign currency exchange rates or commodity prices
