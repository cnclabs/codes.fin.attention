item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and and notes thereto included in this report 
overview we are a regional  vertically integrated provider of solid waste services 
we were founded by our chairman of the board of directors in we operate primarily in north carolina  south carolina  virginia  tennessee and georgia  providing solid waste collection  transfer  recycling  processing and disposal services for commercial  industrial  municipal and residential customers 
at december   we operated collection operations  transfer stations  approximately county convenience drop off centers  recycling facilities and nine landfills in the southeastern us we had revenues of million and operating income of million in the year ended december   and revenues of million and operating income of million in the year ended december  total revenues attributable to services provided are as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  collection residential commercial industrial disposal and transfer recycling service recycled commodity sales other total service revenues from through december   we acquired  either by merger or asset purchase  solid waste collection or disposal operations  with eight being acquired in  being acquired in and nine being acquired in all but four of these acquisitions were accounted for as asset purchases 
accordingly  the results of operations of these acquired businesses have been included in our financial statements only from the respective dates of acquisition and have affected period to period comparisons of our operating results 
during the year ended december   we did not have any significant acquisitions requiring the presentation of the acquired company s historical or the combined company s pro forma financial statements 
we anticipate that a significant part of our future growth will come from acquiring additional solid waste collection  transfer and disposal businesses and  therefore  we expect that additional acquisitions could continue to affect period to period comparisons of our operating results 
current levels of population growth and economic development in the southeastern us and our strong market presence in the region should provide an opportunity to increase our revenues and market share 
as we add customers in existing markets  our density should improve  which we expect will increase our collection efficiencies and profitability 

table of contents executive summary in we continued to focus on our initiatives for achieving positive results and improving our performance 
they are strengthening our competitive position in desired markets  internalizing more of our waste volume  increasing revenues from our landfill operations  and employing best practices to deliver exceptional service 
our performance for was impacted by the business climate we operate within  which saw increased service delivery costs primarily due to higher fuel prices and costs to transfer waste  and increased compliance costs primarily related to compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of despite these challenges  our revenues increased to million and our revenues per man hour improved by nearly 
we have continued to look for and find ways to improve our efficiency and productivity 
in  we rerouted for efficiency over  route days  or about percent of our commercial and residential work  and improved productivity on these routes in the range of to 
in addition  we have increased employee training and centered our efforts on fleet maintenance  data management  and customer pricing 
we believe these efforts will better position our company for growth in service revenue growth of was primarily comprised of internal growth and of net acquisition growth 
of that internal growth  approximately was due to pricing 
we implemented a pricing strategy to adjust pricing on accounts that were not meeting standards  and in some cases  we chose to give up accounts that refused reasonable price increases  resulting in a negative volume component of internal growth for energy surcharges contributed additional growth of in as we continued to adjust pricing to cover certain inflationary costs  as discussed below 
acquisition growth was during  impacted by business acquisitions and six business dispositions over the two year period ended december  revenues from acquisition activity are considered in acquisition growth until the first anniversary date of the acquisition 
all acquisitions in and were tuck ins and a continuation of our plan to expand in selected markets in order to achieve better route density and leverage our overhead cost structure 
we have experienced  as have others in our industry sector  increased operating costs which include higher fuel costs  third party disposal fees  and transfer costs 
most significantly  our average fuel cost per gallon increased approximately in we implemented a fuel surcharge program based upon a regional fuel index  which is designed to recover most of the fuel cost increases 
our capital expenditures of approximately million increased by million over the prior year 
these capital expenditures included million primarily related to cell construction at our landfills 
in  we paid million in dividends compared to million in despite higher capital spending and increased dividend payments  our debt to total capitalization ratio of at december  improved over the prior year ratio of 
we believe our million revolving credit facility  which matures in october  provides sufficient capital in combination with our cash flow from operating activities to fund our near term growth strategy  capital expenditures and dividends 
general our branch waste collection operations generate revenues from fees collected from commercial  industrial and residential collection and transfer station customers 
we derive a substantial portion of our collection revenues from commercial and industrial services that are performed under one year to five year service agreements 
our residential collection services are performed either on a subscription basis with individual households  or under contracts with municipalities  apartment owners  homeowners associations or mobile home park operators 
residential customers on a subscription basis are billed quarterly in advance and provide us with a stable source of revenues 
a liability for future service is recorded upon billing and revenues are recognized during the month in which services are actually provided 
municipal contracts in our existing markets are typically awarded  at least initially  on a competitive bid basis and thereafter on a bid or negotiated basis and usually range in duration from one to five years 
municipal contracts provide consistent cash flow during the terms of the contracts 

table of contents our prices for our solid waste services are typically determined by the collection frequency and level of service  route density  volume  weight and type of waste collected  type of equipment and containers furnished  the distance to the disposal or processing facility  the cost of disposal or processing  and prices charged in our markets for similar services 
our ability to pass on cost increases is sometimes limited by the terms of our contracts 
long term solid waste collection contracts typically contain a formula  generally based on a predetermined published price index  for automatic adjustment of fees to cover increases in some  but not all  operating costs 
at december   we operated approximately convenience sites under contract with nine counties in order to consolidate waste in rural areas 
these contracts  which are usually competitively bid  generally have terms of one to five years and provide consistent cash flow during the term of the contract since we are paid regularly by the local government 
at december   we also operated recycling processing facilities as part of our collection and transfer operations where we collect  process  sort and recycle paper products  aluminum and steel cans  pallets  plastics  glass and other items 
our recycling facilities generate revenues from the collection  processing and resale of recycled commodities  particularly recycled wastepaper 
through a centralized effort  we resell recycled commodities using commercially reasonable practices and seek to manage commodity pricing risk by spreading the risk among our customers 
we also operate curbside residential recycling programs in connection with our residential collection operations in most of the communities we serve 
operating expenses for our collection operations include labor  fuel  equipment maintenance and tipping fees paid to landfills 
at december   we operated or transferred from transfer stations that reduce our costs by improving our utilization of collection personnel and equipment and by consolidating the waste stream to gain more favorable disposal rates 
at december   we owned or operated nine landfills 
operating expenses for these landfill operations include labor  equipment  legal and administrative  ongoing environmental compliance  host community fees  site maintenance and accruals for closure and post closure maintenance 
cost of equipment sales primarily consists of our cost to purchase the disposal compactors and containers that we resell 
we capitalize certain expenditures related to pending acquisitions or development projects that meet stringent capitalization criteria 
indirect acquisition and project development costs  such as executive and corporate overhead  public relations and other corporate services  are expensed as incurred 
our policy is to charge against net income any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances net of any portion thereof that we estimate to be recoverable  through sale or otherwise relating to any operation that is permanently shut down  any acquisition that is not consummated and any landfill development project that is not expected to be successfully completed 
engineering  legal  permitting  construction and other costs directly associated with the acquisition or development of a landfill  together with associated interest  are capitalized 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses include management salaries  clerical and administrative overhead  professional services  costs associated with our marketing and sales force and community relations expense 
property and equipment are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the assets using the straight line method 
other income has not historically been material to our results of operations 
to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations

total revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was attributable primarily to increases in residential collection revenue of million  commercial collection revenue of million  and industrial revenue of million 
the following table provides the components of service revenue growth service revenue growth price volume energy surcharge total internal growth commodities acquisitions  net of dispositions total service revenue growth 
table of contents service revenue growth of was comprised of internal growth and of net acquisition growth 
of that internal growth  approximately was due to pricing 
we implemented a pricing strategy to adjust pricing on accounts that were not meeting standards and 
in some cases  we chose to give up accounts that refused reasonable price increases  resulting in a negative volume component of internal growth for energy surcharges contributed additional growth of in as we continued to adjust pricing to cover certain inflationary costs 
cost of operations 
costs of operations including equipment sales increased million  or  to million in from million in cost of operations as a percentage of revenue decreased in to from in the prior year period 
the following table summarizes the components of cost of operations as a percentage of revenue change labor and related benefits landfill fees  transfer and disposal fuel repairs and maintenance fleet insurance other total cost of service operations cost of equipment sales cost of operations including equipment sales disposal costs continue to decrease as a percentage of revenue as more of the waste we collect is disposed into our landfills 
casualty and workers compensation insurance costs were lower due to favorable insurance pricing as well as an improved experience rating 
fuel costs increased on a per gallon basis for the year ended december   compared with the same period in selling  general administrative expenses 
sg a increased million  or  to million in from million in sg a as a percentage of revenues decreased to in from in the following table summarizes the components of sg a expenses amounts in thousands change labor and related benefits provision for doubtful accounts professional fees insurance rent travel and entertainment utilities other total sg a 
table of contents labor and related benefits increased as we increased our administrative headcount  incentive based compensation  stock option expense and our provision for unvested earned leave benefits 
the decrease in our provision for doubtful accounts was primarily due to the collection in of an approximately million receivable previously included in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the decrease in professional fees is primarily attributable to reduced reliance on external resources for sarbanes oxley compliance 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of property and equipment on a straight line basis from to years  amortization of landfill costs on a units of consumption basis as the landfill airspace is consumed  amortization of landfill asset retirement costs as the landfill airspace is consumed  and amortization of intangible assets with a definite life over to years  using either a declining balance approach or straight line basis  based on the economic benefit we expect to receive 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in as a result of fixed asset and intangible asset additions 
included in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  was a favorable adjustment related to change in estimated lives and salvage values of certain collection vehicles and approximately million in additional landfill amortization resulting from our annual sfas no 
landfill review 
gain on sale of property and equipment and other assets 
the amounts reflected for and represent gains on sale of operating assets  typically facilities and collection vehicles 
asset impairment 
the amounts represented in represent impairment of fixed assets temporarily taken out of service 
the amounts primarily represent impairment of capitalized landfill development costs as we determined the likelihood of successful completion was less than probable 
interest expense net of interest income 
interest expense net of interest income decreased in primarily due to repayment of debt with proceeds from the sale of a landfill operation 
income tax expense 
the effective income tax rate increased to in from a rate of in primarily due to revaluing our deferred tax liabilities at a higher estimated deferred tax rate of  resulting from apportionment and re assessment of state tax planning strategies 
discontinued operations 
income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes increased million from in  we disposed of certain operations in the atlanta market area 
in  we disposed of a landfill operation effective april  in the jacksonville  florida market  resulting in a cumulative after tax gain of million 
these dispositions are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as if they had occurred on january  net income 
net income increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to overall higher gross margin and the gain on the sale of discontinued operations  partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization  sg a costs  and income tax expense 

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
total revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was primarily attributable to increases in the residential  commercial  disposal and transfer  and convenience site product lines 
the following table provides the components of service revenue growth service revenue growth price volume energy surcharge total internal growth commodities acquisitions  net of dispositions total service revenue growth our service revenue growth of was comprised of of acquisition growth and of internal growth 
we were more effective in initiating price increases in due to a disciplined approach towards customer profitability analysis and utilizing our pricing optimization software 
pricing increased  or million  and energy related surcharges increased  or million  versus we implemented a fuel surcharge program based upon a regional fuel index  which is designed to recover most of the increase in fuel costs 
internal volume was up  primarily in the areas of residential  commercial  and disposal transfer 
cost of operations 
cost of operations including equipment sales increased million  or  to million in from million in cost of operations as a percentage of revenues decreased from to for and  respectively 
the following table summarizes the components of cost of operations as a percentage of revenue change labor and related benefits landfill fees  transfer and disposal fuel repairs and maintenance fleet insurance other total cost of service operations cost of equipment sales cost of operations including equipment sales reduced disposal fees due to greater internalization of waste into our landfills 
fuel costs per gallon increased over insurance costs were lower in due to reduced insurance premiums resulting from assumption of higher deductibles versus we also experienced reduced severity and frequency of auto and worker s compensation claims 

table of contents selling  general administrative expenses 
sg a increased million  or  to million in from million in sg a as a percentage of revenues decreased to in from in the following table summarizes the components of sg a expenses amounts in thousands change labor and related benefits provision for doubtful accounts professional fees insurance rent travel and entertainment utilities other total sg a additional headcount to meet increased compliance needs 
includes a charge of approximately million to write off or reserve for accounts receivable of a major customer 
increased compliance costs  primarily related to sarbanes oxley act section compliance of million and million for settlement of a legal matter 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million in from million in depreciation and amortization  as a percentage of revenues  decreased to in from in landfill site and cell amortization expense was million higher due to increased landfill tonnage 
other intangible asset amortization expense increased approximately million due to amortization of customer lists 
gain on sale of collection and hauling operations 
we recognized a gain on sale of collection and hauling operations totaling approximately million in from the sale of operations in mississippi and tennessee 
asset impairment 
we recognized a million impairment charge in related to our determination that certain landfill permitting efforts had a less than probable chance of success 
the remaining million in and million in related to impairment of fixed assets temporarily taken out of service 
interest expense net of interest income 
interest expense net of interest income decreased in primarily due to interest capitalized in relation to ongoing construction projects  partially offset by increased borrowings to fund acquisitions as well as a higher average interest rate on outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
income tax expense 
income tax expense increased million to million in from million in primarily due to higher pre tax income 
the effective tax rate increased to in from a rate of in primarily due to an increase in our estimated deferred income tax liabilities 
discontinued operations 
income from discontinued operations increased in primarily due to the gain recognized upon disposition of the assets of the discontinued operations 
net income 
net income increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was attributable to the changes explained above  most notably  increased sales revenue 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our working capital at december  was a negative million and a negative million at december  the negative amounts were primarily the result of using cash generated from operations for capital expenditures and acquisitions  both long term assets 
our strategy in managing our working capital has been to apply the cash generated from operations that remains available after satisfying our working capital and capital expenditure requirements to reduce indebtedness under our bank revolving credit facility and to minimize our cash balances 
we generally finance our working capital requirements from internally generated funds and bank borrowings 
in addition to internally generated funds  we have in place financing arrangements to satisfy our currently anticipated working capital needs in we have a revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of lending institutions for which bank of america acts as agent 
this million credit facility provides expansion capacity up to million through october virtually all of our assets and those of our subsidiaries  including our interest in the equity securities of our subsidiaries  secure our obligations under the revolver 
pursuant to an intercreditor agreement with bank of america  prudential insurance shares in the collateral pledged under the revolver 
in addition  our subsidiaries have guaranteed our obligations under the prudential term loan facilities 
the revolver bears interest at a rate per annum equal to  at our option  either a bank of america base rate or at the eurodollar rate libor plus  in each case  a percentage rate that fluctuates  based on our leverage ratio  from to for base rate borrowings and to for libor rate borrowings 
the revolver requires us to maintain financial covenants and satisfy other requirements  such as minimum net worth  net income  and limits on our capital expenditures and indebtedness 
it also requires the lenders approval of acquisitions in some circumstances 
we were in compliance with these financial covenants as of december  and december  as of december   an aggregate of approximately million was outstanding under the revolver  with an average interest rate on outstanding borrowings of approximately 
availability under this facility was approximately million as of december  after consideration of outstanding letters of credit 
we have two million term facilities with prudential  of which million in the aggregate was outstanding as of december  principal repayments are due annually on each of the facilities 
the prudential facilities require us to maintain financial covenants  such as minimum net worth  net income  and limit our capital expenditures and indebtedness 
we were in compliance with these financial covenants as of december  and december  interest on the two prudential facilities is paid quarterly  based on fixed rates for the two facilities of and  respectively 
on september   we entered into a million income tax exempt variable rate bond with sampson county  north carolina for the funding of expansion at our landfill in that county 
this bond payable was in addition to our existing million sampson facility 
both bonds are backed by a letter of credit issued by wachovia bank na as a participating lender under our bank of america syndication 
the average interest rate on outstanding borrowings under both sampson facilities was approximately and at december  and  respectively 
as of december   we had the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year to years to years over years long term debt expected landfill liabilities disposal agreemements purchase commitments operating leases capital leases total contractual cash obligations 
table of contents includes recorded principal amounts outstanding as december  of million under our revolver  million under the prudential term facilities  and million under the sampson bond facilities 
our revolver allows us to borrow up to million  with further expansion capacity available upon lenders approval  provided we are in compliance with the facility s loan covenants 
includes projected interest assuming the various debt facilities are held to maturity at current rates 
as disclosed in note of our consolidated financial statements  we have entered into various interest rate swaps  which fixed the interest rate for a portion of our debt through as of december   the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements recorded on our consolidated balance sheet was an asset of approximately million 
additionally  we have entered into commodity contracts to hedge our recycling revenue received for old corrugated cardboard 
the commodity contracts have a term of three years 
the fair values of the cardboard commodity contracts are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as a liability of approximately million as of december  we also use heating oil option agreements to manage a portion of our exposure to fluctuations in diesel fuel oil prices 
the fair value of the fuel commodity contract was recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as an asset of approximately  as of december  the above table does not include any obligations for these arrangements 
liabilities are based on current costs and include capping  closure  post closure and environmental remediation costs 
these costs represent the expected landfill liabilities we will incur for final capping  closure and post closure for the airspace consumed to date 
we will recognize additional liabilities for these types of costs as airspace is consumed in each landfill 
these obligations are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets 
agreements whereby we agree to deliver a minimum amount of waste at a set rate 
these obligations are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets based on actual volume 
represents purchase obligations not yet recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
represents future minimum lease payments under our existing operating leases 
these payments are not recorded as obligations in our consolidated balance sheets with the exception of any deferred rental credits due to lease escalation clauses 
includes recorded principal amounts outstanding as of december  of million under capital lease agreements as well as anticipated interest payments 
we use financial surety bonds for a variety of corporate guarantees 
the two largest uses of financial surety bonds are for municipal contract performance guarantees and landfill closure and post closure financial assurance required under applicable environmental regulations 
environmental regulations require demonstrated financial assurance to meet closure and post closure requirements for landfills 
in addition to surety bonds  these requirements may also be met through alternative financial assurance instruments  including insurance and letters of credit 
amount of commitment expiration per period commercial commitments total amounts committed less than year to years over years in thousands standby letters of credit performance bonds total commercial commitments net cash provided by operating activities totaled million for the year ended december  and consisted of net income of million plus non cash adjustments eg depreciation and amortization  etc 
of million and net changes in assets liabilities of million 

table of contents for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was million 
of this  million was used to fund the cash portion of acquisitions  offset by million provided from the sale of collection and hauling operations  and million was used for capital expenditures  of which million was for landfill expansion  with the balance primarily for investments in equipment  consisting primarily of trucks and containers 
cash inflows from investing activities included million received from the sale of property and equipment and other assets 
for the year ended december   capital expenditures were million  compared to million in we currently expect capital expenditures for to be approximately million 
in  million of the expected capital expenditures are earmarked for landfill site and cell construction and equipment 
we have funded and expect to fund our capital expenditures principally through internally generated funds and borrowings under existing credit facilities 
as an owner and potential acquirer of additional new landfill disposal facilities  we might also be required to make significant expenditures to bring newly acquired disposal facilities into compliance with applicable regulatory requirements  obtain permits for newly acquired disposal facilities or expand the available disposal capacity at any such newly acquired disposal facilities 
the amount of these expenditures cannot be currently determined because they will depend on the nature and extent of any acquired landfill disposal facilities  the condition of any facilities acquired and the permitting status of any acquired sites 
we expect we would fund any capital expenditures to acquire solid waste collection and disposal businesses  to the extent we could not fund such acquisitions with our common stock  and any regulatory expenses for newly acquired disposal facilities through borrowings under our existing credit facilities 
we have financial obligations relating to closure and post closure costs  or long term care of disposal facilities that we operate or for which we are or might become responsible 
landfill closure and post closure costs include estimated costs to be incurred for final closure of landfills and estimated costs for providing required post closure monitoring and maintenance of landfills 
we estimate these future cost requirements based on our interpretation of the technical standards of the epa s subtitle d regulations 
our estimate of capping  final closure of our operating facilities  and post closure monitoring costs considers when the costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates 
we provide accruals for these future costs generally for a term of years after final closure of any landfill  and will provide additional accruals for these and other landfills we might acquire or develop in the future  based on engineering estimates of consumption of airspace over the useful lives of such facilities 
due to the inherent uncertainties related to the total costs for capping  final closure of our operating facilities and post closure monitoring costs  there can be no assurance that our ultimate financial obligations for actual closure or post closure costs will not exceed the amount accrued and reserved or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to insurance policies or trust funds 
such a circumstance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
for the year ended december   net cash used in financing activities was million  which primarily included net repayments of long term debt including capital leases of million and dividends paid of million 
additionally  we received approximately million from stock option exercises 
cash flows from operations discontinued in and have not been presented separately in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
the impact of these dispositions on prior year operating  financing  and investing activities is insignificant  with the exception of the million cash proceeds from the sale of the discontinued operations in at december   we had approximately million of long term and short term borrowings outstanding including capital leases and approximately million in letters of credit including performance bonds 
the ratio of our total debt including capital leases to total capitalization was at december   compared to as of december  off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had the following off balance sheet arrangements one of our wholly owned subsidiaries entered into a franchise agreement with camden county  north carolina  effective november  see item legal proceedings 
pursuant to the franchise agreement  we have agreed to indemnify the county  its officers  employees and agents  which would include the county commissioners  against all claims arising out of the franchise agreement 
as a result  we are liable for the expenses of  and any damages or other awards ultimately determined against  those defendants 
this arrangement has not materially affected our financial position  results of operations or liquidity during the year ended december  nor is it expected to have a material impact on our future financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
newly adopted accounting pronouncements for discussion of the new accounting standards that affect us  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 

table of contents application of critical accounting policies and estimates we have established various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in the preparation of our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we consider our critical accounting policies to be those accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions that have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities 
the estimates and assumptions we use are based on historical experience and other factors  which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and our results of operations for the reporting periods 
we believe the following are critical accounting policies that require the most significant estimates and assumptions that are particularly susceptible to a significant change in the future allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
our estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon historical collection trends  type of customer  such as municipal or non municipal  the age of the outstanding receivables and existing economic conditions 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and  respectively 
self insurance reserves we assume the risks for medical  dental  workers compensation  and casualty insurance exposures up to certain loss thresholds set forth in separate insurance contracts 
our insurance accruals are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported and are developed by our management with assistance from third party experts 
the insurance accruals are influenced by our past claims experience factors  which have a limited history 
if we experience insurance claims or costs above or below our historically evaluated levels  our estimates could be materially affected 
the frequency and amount of claims or incidents could vary significantly over time  which could materially affect our self insurance liabilities 
additionally  the actual costs to settle the self insurance liabilities could materially differ from the original estimates and cause us to incur additional costs in future periods associated with prior year claims 
landfills we have material financial commitments for final capping  closure and post closure obligations with respect to our landfills 
we develop our estimates of final capping  closure and post closure obligations using input from our third party engineers and internal accounting 
our estimates are based on our interpretation of current requirements and proposed regulatory changes and are intended to approximate fair value 
absent quoted market prices  the estimate of fair value should be based on the best available information  including the results of present value techniques in accordance with statement of financial accounting concepts  or sfac  no 
 using cash flow and present value in accounting measurements 
in general  we rely on third parties to fulfill most of our obligations for final capping  closure and post closure 
accordingly  the fair market value of these obligations is based upon quoted and actual prices paid for similar work 
we intend to perform some of these capping  closure and post closure obligations using internal resources 
where internal resources are expected to be used to fulfill an asset retirement obligation  we have added a profit margin onto the estimated cost of such services to better reflect their fair market value as required by statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
when we then perform these services internally  the added profit margin is recognized as a component of operating income in the period earned 
sfac no 
further states that an estimate of fair value should include the price that marketplace participants are able to receive for bearing the uncertainties in cash flows 
however  when utilizing discounted cash flow techniques  reliable estimates of market premiums may not be obtainable 
in this situation  sfac no 
indicates that it is not necessary to consider a market risk premium in the determination of expected cash flows 
in the waste industry  there is not an active market that can be utilized to determine the fair value of these activities as there is no market that exists for selling the responsibility for final capping  closure and post closure obligations independent of selling the landfill in its entirety 
accordingly  we believe that it is not possible to develop a methodology to reliably estimate a market risk premium and have excluded a market risk premium from our determination of expected cash flows for landfill asset retirement obligations in accordance with sfac no 
once we have determined the estimates of final capping  closure and post closure obligations  we then inflate those costs to the expected time of payment and discount those expected future costs back to present value 
we are currently inflating these costs in current dollars until the expected time of payment using an inflation rate of and are discounting these costs to present value using a credit adjusted  risk free discount rate between and 
the credit adjusted  risk free rate is based on the risk free interest rate adjusted for our credit standing 
management reviews these estimates at least once per year 
significant changes in future final capping  closure and post closure cost estimates and inflation rates typically result in both a current adjustment to the 
table of contents recorded liability and corresponding adjustment to the landfill asset  based on the landfill s capacity that has been consumed  and a change in liability and asset amounts to be recorded prospectively over the remaining capacity of the landfill 
any change related to the capitalized and future cost of the landfill asset is then recognized in amortization expense prospectively over the remaining capacity of the landfill 
changes in our credit adjusted  risk free rate do not change recorded liabilities  but subsequently recognized obligations are measured using the revised credit adjusted risk free rate 
we record the estimated fair value of final capping  closure and post closure obligations for our landfills based on the landfills capacity that has been consumed through the current period 
this liability and corresponding asset is accrued on a per ton basis 
the estimated fair value of each final capping event will be fully accrued when the tons associated with such capping event have been disposed in the landfill 
additionally  the estimated fair value of total final capping  closure and post closure costs will be fully accrued for each landfill at the time the site discontinues accepting waste and is closed 
capping accruals generally consider the installation of flexible membrane and geosynthetic clay liners  drainage and compacted soil layers  and topsoil over portions of the landfill where total airspace has been consumed 
closure and post closure accruals consider estimates for methane gas control  leachate management and ground water monitoring and other operational and maintenance costs to be incurred after the site discontinues accepting waste  which is generally expected to be for a period of up to years after final site closure 
daily maintenance activities  which include many of these costs  are incurred during the operating life of the landfill and are expensed as incurred 
daily maintenance activities include leachate disposal  surface water  groundwater  and methane gas monitoring and maintenance  other pollution control activities  mowing and fertilizing the landfill cap  fence and road maintenance  and third party inspection and reporting costs 
for purchased disposal sites  we assess and record present value based final capping  closure and post closure obligations at the time we assume such responsibilities 
such liabilities are based on the estimated final capping  closure and post closure costs and the percentage of airspace consumed related to such obligations as of the date we assumed the responsibility 
thereafter  we account for the landfill and related final capping  closure and post closure obligations consistent with the policy described above 
interest accretion on final capping  closure and post closure obligations is recorded using the effective interest method and is recorded as final capping  closure and post closure expense  which is included in operating costs on the statement of operations 
in the united states  the closure and post closure obligations are established by the environmental protection agency s subtitles c and d regulations  as implemented and applied on a state by state basis 
the costs to comply with these obligations could increase in the future as a result of legislation or regulation 
we routinely review our investment in operating landfills to determine whether the costs of these investments are realizable 
judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on regulatory factors  market conditions and operational performance of our landfills 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that our landfill carrying costs are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
while the precise amounts of these future obligations cannot be determined  at december   we estimate total landfill closure and post closure costs of approximately million for the airspace consumed to date 
our estimate of these costs considers when the costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates 
we had accrued approximately million for such projected costs as of december  and subsequently paid approximately million in we provide accruals for these future costs generally for a term of years after final closure of any landfill  and will provide additional accruals for these and other landfills we might acquire or develop in the future  based on engineering estimates of consumption of airspace over the useful lives of such facilities 
there can be no assurance that our ultimate financial obligations for actual closure or post closure costs will not exceed the amount accrued and reserved or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to insurance policies or trust funds 
such a circumstance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
derivative financial instruments we utilize cash flow hedge agreements to manage a portion of our risks related to fluctuation in interest rates and certain commodity prices 
the fair values of all derivative instruments are recorded as assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
we formally document our hedge relationships  including identifying the hedge instruments and hedged items  as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for entering into the hedge transaction 
our interest rate swap derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in order to qualify for hedge accounting  criteria must be met  including a requirement that both at inception of the hedge  and on an ongoing basis  the hedging relationship is expected to be highly effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk during the term of the hedge 
when it is determined that a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge  we discontinue hedge accounting  and any gains or losses on the derivative instrument are recognized in earnings 

table of contents acquisitions and dispositions acquisition purchase price is allocated to identified intangible assets and tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition  with any residual amounts allocated to goodwill 
the purchase price allocations are considered preliminary until we are no longer waiting for information that we have arranged to obtain and that is known to be available or obtainable 
although the time required to obtain the necessary information will vary with circumstances specific to an individual acquisition  the allocation period for finalizing purchase price allocations generally does not exceed one year from the consummation of a business combination 
we often consummate single acquisitions of multiple solid waste collection or disposal operations 
for each separately identified solid waste collection or disposal operation acquired in a single acquisition  we perform an initial allocation of total purchase price to the acquired operation based on our relative fair value 
following this initial allocation of total purchase price to the acquired operation  we further allocate the identified intangible assets and tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed for each solid waste collection or disposal operation based on our estimated fair value at the dates of acquisition  with any residual amounts allocated to either goodwill or landfill site costs 
from time to time  we consummate acquisitions in which we exchange operations we own for operations owned by another solid waste company 
these exchange transactions require us to estimate the fair market value of either the operations we receive or the operations we dispose of  whichever is more clearly evident 
to the extent that the fair market value of the operations we dispose of differs from the fair market value of the operations we obtain  cash is either remitted or received to offset the difference in fair market values 
from time to time  we dispose of certain operations that no longer fit our strategy 
the tangible assets and certain intangible assets sold are removed at book value 
goodwill is removed based on the relative fair value of the business being sold to the fair value of the reporting unit 
we accrue additional consideration when it is probable the funds will be received  generally at the time of receipt 
intangible assets on an ongoing basis  we perform an annual impairment test 
at least quarterly  we also analyze whether an event has occurred that would more likely than not reduce its enterprise fair value below its carrying amount and  if necessary  will perform a goodwill impairment test between annual dates 
impairment charges are recognized as operating expenses 
we adopted july as our annual assessment date 
we completed our annual impairment test as of july  and determined that there was no goodwill impairment 
intangible assets with a definite life are amortized over their expected lives  typically five to ten years see note to our notes to consolidated financial statements on a straight line or accelerated basis to match the economic benefit received 
asset impairment we review long lived assets for impairment on a market by market basis whenever events or changes in the circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable 
if an evaluation is required  the projected future net cash flows on an undiscounted basis attributable to each market would be compared to the carrying value of the long lived assets including an allocation of goodwill  if appropriate of that market 
if an impairment is indicated  the amount of the impairment is measured based on the fair value of the asset 
we also evaluate the remaining useful lives to determine whether events and circumstances warrant revised estimates of such lives 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure of market risk quantitative disclosures 
we entered into interest rate swap agreements in march to modify the interest characteristics of our outstanding long term debt and designated the qualifying instrument as a cash flow hedge 
under the terms of the agreements  the interest rate swaps hedged notional debt value of million 
these swaps are in effect for the period november through february  with fixed rates of 

table of contents our cash flows are impacted by fluctuations in commodity pricing 
to reduce our risk to market fluctuations  we enter into commodity swap contracts to hedge our cash flows from the sale of old corrugated cardboard  or occ 
the notional amounts hedged under these agreements represent approximately of our current occ volume 
we have used heating oil option agreements to manage a portion of our exposure to fluctuation in diesel fuel oil prices 
to date  such agreements have not been significant to our financial condition and results of operations 
on december   we entered into a heating oil hedge contract  effective january   to cap our exposure on million gallons of diesel fuel at per gallon 
the hedge coverage represented approximately of our first quarter diesel fuel requirements  and expired on march  in november  we entered into a heating oil hedge contract  effective december   to cap our exposure on million gallons of diesel fuel at per gallon through april in may  we entered into a heating oil hedge contract  effective june   to cap our exposure on approximately million gallons of diesel fuel at per gallon through may in august  we entered into a heating oil contract  effective september   to cap our exposure on approximately million gallons of diesel fuel at per gallon through june we currently use approximately million gallons of fuel per year 
at this rate of consumption  a cost change of per gallon would have a  impact on our annual operating income  prior to any recoveries from fuel surcharges 
the following table below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates of our long term debt at december  by expected maturity dates 
fair values have been determined based on our incremental borrowing rate of as of december  thereafter total carrying value total fair value in thousands fixed rate variable rate qualitative disclosures 
our primary exposure relates to interest rate risk on long term and short term borrowings  the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to meet interest expense payments and not exceed financial covenants  and the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to obtain adequate financing to fund future acquisitions 
we manage interest rate risk on outstanding long term and short term debt through the use of fixed and variable rate debt 
while we cannot predict the impact interest rate movements will have on existing debt  we continue to evaluate our financial position on an ongoing basis
