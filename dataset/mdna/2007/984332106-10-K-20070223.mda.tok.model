summary we believe the search queries  page views  click throughs and related marketing services revenues and fees revenues correlate to the number and activity level of users across our offerings on the yahoo properties 
in the fourth quarter of  we launched a new search marketing system  referred to as project panama  and we have been transitioning our advertisers on to the new system gradually in the united states and will begin transitioning our advertisers in international markets in the second quarter of we believe the new search marketing system  including the new ranking model which was launched in the united states in the first quarter of  will enable us to provide a more relevant search experience to users  more valuable customer leads to advertisers  and additional opportunities to our distribution partners 
by providing a platform for our users that brings together our search technology  content  and community while allowing for personalization and integration across devices  we seek to become more essential to  increase our share of  and deepen the engagement of  our users with our products and services

marketing services revenue 
marketing services revenue for the year ended december  increased by approximately  million  or percent  as compared to the prior year 
our marketing services revenue in was impacted by declining revenues from our relationship with microsoft corporation microsoft  which completed the transition of its united states search business in house during marketing services revenue for the year ended december  increased by approximately  million  or percent  as compared to the year over year growth in marketing services revenue in  despite the impact of microsoft s transition  and in can be attributed to a combination of factors that have driven increased marketing service revenue across the yahoo properties both domestically and internationally 
these included an increase in our user base and activity levels on the yahoo properties  which resulted in a higher volume of search queries  page views and click throughs 
on the yahoo properties  our number of unique users worldwide as of december  was approximately percent higher than the number of unique users as of december   which was percent higher than december  unique users refers to our internal estimates of the number of people who visited the yahoo properties in a given month 

table of contents during the year ended december   we refined our method for computing changes in the volume of page views and searches and average revenue per page view and search to include only page views which include searches on the yahoo properties and searches performed on our affiliate network sites  and to exclude the impact of content match links 
since the introduction of the content match offering in  the growth in the number of content match links on our affiliate network sites has been significant but the related revenues have not been proportionate  resulting in a disproportionate impact on our volume and revenue yield measures as computed under our prior methodology 
using this refined method  which we believe more accurately reflects trends in our volume and revenue yield measures  the combined number of page views and searches increased by approximately percent in the year ended december   compared to the prior year 
the combined number of page views and searches increased by approximately percent in the year ended december   compared to the same period in using our refined method 
the increases in the volume of page views and searches can be attributed to an increased number of users  an increased number of affiliates  and an expanded offering of properties which increased our inventory of page views 
the combined average revenue per page view and search increased by approximately one percent in the year ended december   compared to the same period in our combined revenue per page view and search in benefited as we expanded our offerings on the yahoo properties  introduced new inventory with different yields and better monetized our inventory 
the combined average revenue per page view and search increased by approximately percent in the year ended december   compared to the same period in this increase resulted primarily from sales mix changes from period to period as we expanded our offerings on the yahoo properties and introduced new inventory with differing yields 
we believe our growing number of users  advertisers and inventory  both on and off our network  over the past couple of years has been driving the increases in our marketing services revenues 
we believe our expanding offerings  including our enhanced algorithmic search technology  contribute to our growing number of users 
as our user base increases  we generate a higher number of page views  which we view as inventory  and process a higher number of search queries which potentially result in a higher number of impressions and paid clicks 
we also believe that our growing audience of users makes the yahoo properties more attractive to advertisers and increases their spending on marketing services 
further  we believe the growth in users on the yahoo properties and on the internet overall reflects the increasing acceptance  importance and dependence of users on the internet 
as a result of the increasing online audience  we believe advertisers are shifting a greater percentage of their spending from traditional media to the internet to reach this growing audience 
fees revenue 
for the year ended december   fees revenue increased approximately million  or percent  as compared to the prior year 
the year over year growth is associated with an increase in the number of paying users for our fee based services  which numbered million as of december   compared to million as of december   an increase of percent 
the impact of this increase in our number of paying users was offset by a reduction in the average monthly revenues per paying user 
for the year ended december   fees revenue increased approximately million  or percent  as compared to of which million related to acquisitions 
approximately million was associated with an increase in the number of paying users for our fee based services  which were million as of december  compared to million as of december   an increase of percent 
our increased base of paying users was due to user growth across most of our offerings  with the largest growth generated from new internet broadband subscribers 
our fee based services include internet broadband services  sports  music  games  personals  and premium mail offerings  as well as our services for small businesses 
average monthly revenue per paying user decreased to approximately for the year ended december   compared to approximately for the same periods in and the decline in average monthly revenue per paying user reflects the continued growth of paying users in our services with lower fees 
we currently expect marketing services revenue to increase in absolute dollars for compared to as we seek to increase users and traffic on our yahoo properties by providing a more relevant search experience to users  providing more relevant and valuable customer leads to advertisers from our new search marketing system  by continuously improving our technologies to expand our offerings  and by further benefiting from expected growth

primary currencies include euros  british pounds  japanese yen  korean won  and australian dollars 
the statements of income of our international operations are translated into united states dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period 
to the extent the united states dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in reduced revenues  operating expenses and net income for our international segment

as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable debt securities totaling billion  compared to billion as of december  during the year ended december   we invested billion in direct and structured stock repurchases  million in net capital expenditures  including million for purchase of land in santa clara  california  and a net million in acquisitions 
the cash used for these investments was offset by billion cash generated from operating activities  million from the issuance of common stock as a result of the exercise of employee stock options  and million of excess tax benefits from stock based awards which was reported as a reduction of cash flows from operating activities and an increase to cash flows from financing activities 
as of december   approximately billion of earnings held by our foreign subsidiaries and a corporate joint venture are designated as indefinitely invested outside the united states 
if these funds were required for our operations in the united states  we would be required to accrue and pay additional taxes to repatriate these funds 
currently  we do not anticipate a need to repatriate these funds to our united states operations 
we invest excess cash predominantly in marketable debt securities that are liquid  of high quality investment grade  and the majority of which have effective maturities of less than two years 
we also invest excess cash to support our growing infrastructure needs and expand our operations  as consideration for acquisitions and strategic investments  to repurchase shares of our stock and in other transactions 
as of december   certain of our marketable debt securities had a fair value below cost due to the changes in market rates of interest and yields on these securities 
we evaluate these investments periodically for possible other than temporary impairment and review factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis  the financial condition of the issuer  and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time which may be sufficient for an anticipated recovery in market value 
we have the intent and ability to hold these securities for a reasonable period of time sufficient for a forecasted recovery of fair value up to or beyond the initial cost of the investment and expect to realize the full value of all of these investments upon maturity or sale 
we expect to continue to generate positive cash flow from operations in management believes existing cash  cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt securities  together with any cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet normal operating requirements including capital expenditures for the next months 
however  we may sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities to further enhance our liquidity position  and the sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
cash flow changes cash provided by operating activities is driven by our net income  adjusted for non cash items  and non operating gains and losses from sales of investments 
non cash adjustments include depreciation  amortization of intangible assets  stock based compensation expense  tax benefits from stock based awards  deferred income taxes  and

cash provided by operating activities was greater than net income in mainly due to the net impact of non cash adjustments to income 
in each of the three years ended december    and  cash flows from operations were reduced by the increase in our accounts receivable balance  mainly reflecting increases in revenues 
the days of sales outstanding metric increased over the three years ended december  additionally  in the years ended december    and  there were significant increases in accrued expenses and other liabilities that positively impacted cash flow from operations 
these increases were mainly due to higher accrual balances for tac payments to affiliates arising from increased revenue 
cash used in investing activities is primarily attributable to capital expenditures  purchases and sales of marketable debt and equity securities  as well as acquisitions including our strategic investments 
our capital expenditures totaled million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
our capital expenditures have been primarily used for purchases and internal development of information technology assets and real estate to support our expanding offerings  our increased number of users and our international growth 
our capital expenditures in included million for purchase of land in santa clara  california 
we invested a net of million in acquisitions  including strategic investments  in  compared to  million and million in and  respectively 
acquisitions and investments in included cash outlays for our investments in yahoo  gmarket inc and right media inc our acquisitions in included net cash consideration of approximately billion for our investment in alibaba  billion for the purchase of the outstanding interests in our joint ventures in europe and korea and million for the verdisoft acquisition 
the acquisitions of  kelkoo  and musicmatch were the main cash outlays for acquisitions in our cash proceeds from the net sales and maturities of marketable debt securities were million in  compared to cash proceeds of million in and net purchases of million in additionally  we generated cash in the amounts of  million and million in and  respectively  from the sale of non strategic marketable equity securities for which there was no comparable activity in cash provided by used in financing activities is driven by our financing activities relating to employee option exercises and stock repurchases 
our cash proceeds from employee option exercises were million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in compared to was primarily a result of a reduced number of employees exercising options in the increase in was a result of the increase in our employee numbers and an increase in the weighted average exercise prices of our options when compared to during  we used billon in the direct purchase of million shares of our common stock at an average price of per share 
during  we used million in the direct repurchase of million shares of our common stock at an average price of per share 
there were no comparable transactions in in  we entered into structured stock repurchase transactions  which settle in cash or stock depending on the market price of our common stock on the date of maturity  resulting in a total cash outlay of billion 
this billion cash outlay was offset by cash receipts of million from the settlement of a structured stock repurchase transactions entered into in  for a net cash usage of million for these transactions in in  we entered into structured stock repurchase transactions resulting in a total cash outlay of billion 
this billion cash outlay was offset by cash receipts of billion from the settlement of structured stock repurchase transactions in  for a net cash usage of billion for these transactions in during  we entered into structured stock repurchase transactions resulting in a total cash outlay of million  which were offset by cash receipts of million from the settlement of structured stock repurchase transactions  for a net cash usage of million for these transactions in additionally  in  excess tax benefits from stock based awards of million was included as a source of cash flows from financing activities 
upon adoption of sfas r on january   we have included as part of our cash flows from financing activities  the benefit of tax deductions related to stock based awards in excess of the gross tax benefits expected at the grant date of the related stock based awards 
this amount is shown as a reduction to cash flows from operating activities and an increase to cash flows from financing activities 
net cash flows remain unchanged from what would have been reported prior to the adoption of sfas r 

table of contents financing in april  we issued million of zero coupon senior convertible notes the notes which are due in april these notes are convertible into yahoo common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events 
each  principal amount of the notes will be convertible prior to april if the market price of our common stock reaches a specified threshold for a defined period of time or specified corporate transactions occur 
upon conversion  we have the right to deliver cash in lieu of common stock 
as of december   the market price condition for convertibility of the notes was satisfied with respect to the fiscal quarter beginning january  and ending march  we may be required to repurchase all of the notes following a fundamental change of the company  such as a change of control  prior to maturity at face value 
we may not redeem the notes prior to their maturity

stock repurchases in march  following the completion of the billion stock repurchase program that was authorized in and extended in  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to billion of our outstanding shares of common stock over the next five years  dependent on market conditions  share price and other factors 
under this program  during the year ended december   we repurchased million shares of common stock at an average price of per share  including million shares received upon the maturity of structured stock repurchase transactions  and substantially completed this program in october total cash consideration for the stock repurchases in was billion which consisted of billion direct stock repurchases  billion as a result of settlements of structured stock repurchase transactions originally entered into in  and billion as a result of settlements of structured stock repurchase transactions originally entered into in see note stockholders equity in the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
in october  our board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program for us to repurchase up to billion of our outstanding shares of common stock from time to time over the next five years  depending on market conditions  share price  and other factors 
we believe that additional repurchases made under appropriate market conditions are a prudent use of cash currently available to us in order to enhance long term stockholder value 
repurchases may take place in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  including derivative transactions  and may be made under a rule b plan 
subsequent to december  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock under the current stock repurchase program at an average price of per share  for a total amount of million 
capital expenditures capital expenditures have generally comprised purchases of computer hardware  software  server equipment  furniture and fixtures  and real estate 
capital expenditures  net were million in  including million for a land purchase in santa clara  california  compared to million in our capital expenditures in are expected to be consistent with levels as we continue to invest in the expansion of the yahoo properties and our offerings 
this level of expenditure  together with the increase in operating lease commitments  is consistent with our increased headcount and operational expansion  and we anticipate that this will continue in the future as business conditions merit

we have entered into various non cancelable operating lease agreements for our offices throughout the united states  and for our international subsidiaries with original lease periods up to years and expiring between and see note commitments and contingencies in the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we are obligated to make payments under contracts to provide sponsored search and or display advertising services to our affiliates  which represent traffic acquisition costs 
we are obligated to make payments under various arrangements with vendors and other business partners  principally for marketing  bandwidth and content arrangements 
other commitments in the ordinary course of business  we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers  vendors  lessors  business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters  including  but not limited to  losses arising out of our breach of agreements  services to be provided by us  or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties 
in addition  we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us  among other things  to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers 
we have also agreed to indemnify certain former officers  directors and employees of acquired companies in connection with the acquisition of such companies 
we maintain director and officer insurance  which may cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to indemnify our directors and officers 
it is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement 
such indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses 
historically  we have not incurred material costs as a result of obligations under these agreements and we have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in our consolidated financial statements 
in  we reversed an earn out accrual related to a prior acquisition  which resulted in a million reduction to operating expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
as of december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
in february  we committed to invest up to million through july to acquire rights to intellectual property 
license payments associated with the acquired rights will be amortized over the useful life of the related intellectual property 

table of contents critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
our revenues are generated from marketing services and fees 
marketing services revenue is generated from several offerings including the display of textual  rich media advertisements  display of text based links to the advertiser s websites  listing based services  and commerce based transactions 
fees revenue includes revenue from a variety of consumer and business fee based services 
while the majority of our revenue transactions contain standard business terms and conditions  there are certain transactions that contain non standard business terms and conditions 
in addition  we may enter into certain sales transactions that involve multiple element arrangements arrangements with more than one deliverable 
we also enter into arrangements to purchase goods and or services from certain customers 
as a result  significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting for these transactions including whether an arrangement exists  how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among potential multiple elements  when to recognize revenue on the deliverables  whether all elements of the arrangement have been delivered  whether the arrangements should be reported gross as a principal versus net as an agent  and whether we receive a separately identifiable benefit from purchase arrangements with our customers for which we can reasonably estimate fair value 
in addition  our revenue recognition policy requires an assessment as to whether collection is reasonably assured  which inherently requires us to evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers 
changes in judgments on these assumptions and estimates could materially impact the timing or amount of revenue recognition 
deferred income tax asset valuation allowance 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred income tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including our operating results  ongoing tax planning and forecasts of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes 
the valuation allowance decreased by billion during the year ended december  the decrease included a million release to additional paid in capital and a million release to goodwill 
the remaining decrease in the valuation allowance of billion relates to deferred income tax assets pertaining to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards resulting from the exercise of employee stock options in prior years and represents tax benefits in excess of stock based compensation expense as determined under apb see note income taxes in the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units  and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows  and determining appropriate discount rates  growth rates and other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit which could trigger impairment 
see note goodwill in the consolidated 
table of contents financial statements for additional information 
based on our impairment test  there would have to be a significant unfavorable change to our assumptions used in such calculations for an impairment to exist 
we amortize other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives 
we record an impairment charge on these assets when we determine that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
the carrying value is not recoverable if it exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
when there is existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment of intangible assets based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model 
our estimates of future cash flows attributable to our other intangible assets require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results and are subject to many factors 
different assumptions and judgments could materially affect the calculation of the fair value of our other intangible assets which could trigger impairment 
investments in equity interests 
we account for investments in entities in which we can exercise significant influence but do not own a majority equity interest or otherwise control using the equity method 
in accounting for these investments we record our proportionate share of these entities net income or loss  one quarter in arrears 
we review all of our investments in equity interests for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be fully recoverable 
the impairment review requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment 
investments identified as having an indication of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the impairment is other than temporary and this analysis requires estimating the fair value of the investment 
the determination of the fair value of the investment involves considering factors such as the following the stock prices of public companies in which we have an equity investment  current economic and market conditions  the operating performance of the companies including current earnings trends and undiscounted cash flows  quoted stock prices of comparable public companies  and other company specific information including recent financing rounds 
the fair value determination  particularly for investments in privately held companies  requires significant judgment to determine appropriate estimates and assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could affect the calculation of the fair value of the investments and the determination of whether any identified impairment is other than temporary 
stock based compensation expense 
effective january  we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method and therefore have not restated prior periods results 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  we recognize stock based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and therefore only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest over the service period of the award 
prior to sfas r adoption  we accounted for share based payments under apb and accordingly  generally recognized stock based compensation expense related to restricted stock awards and stock options with intrinsic value that we exchanged in connection with acquisitions and accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
calculating stock based compensation expense requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected term of the stock based awards  stock price volatility  and the pre vesting option forfeiture rate 
we estimate the expected life of options granted based on historical exercise patterns  which we believe are representative of future behavior 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock on the date of grant based on the implied volatility of publicly traded options on our common stock  with a term of one year or greater 
we believe that implied volatility calculated based on actively traded options on our common stock is a better indicator of expected volatility and future stock price trends than historical volatility 
therefore  expected volatility for the year ended december  was based on a market based implied volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience of our stock based awards that are granted  exercised and cancelled 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations  and changes in the market values of our investments 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we invest excess cash in marketable debt instruments of the united states government and its agencies  and in high quality corporate issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we protect and preserve invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
as of december  and  we had investments in short term marketable debt securities of approximately billion and billion  respectively 
such investments had a weighted average yield of approximately percent and percent  respectively 
as of december  and  we had investments in long term marketable debt securities of approximately billion and billion  respectively 
such investments had a weighted average yield of approximately percent and percent  respectively 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million and million decrease approximately percent  respectively  in the fair value of our available for sale debt securities as of december  and the fair market value of the zero coupon senior convertible notes the notes issued by yahoo and due in april is subject to interest rate risk and market risk due to the convertible feature of the notes 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the fair market value of the notes will also increase as the market price of the yahoo stock increases and decrease as the 
table of contents market price falls 
the interest and market value changes affect the fair market value of the notes but do not impact our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
as of december  and  the fair value of the notes was approximately billion and billion  respectively  based on quoted market prices 
foreign currency risk 
international revenues accounted for approximately percent of total revenues in  compared to percent of total revenues in international revenues in increased million  or percent  compared to the prior year 
the growth in our international operations has increased our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
revenues and related expenses generated from our international subsidiaries are generally denominated in the functional currencies of the local countries 
primary currencies include euros  british pounds  japanese yen  korean won and australian dollars 
the statements of income of our international operations are translated into united states dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period 
to the extent the united states dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in reduced revenues  operating expenses and net income for our international segment 
similarly  our revenues  operating expenses and net income will increase for our international segment  if the united states dollar weakens against foreign currencies 
the application of our average foreign currency exchange rates to our international revenues and segment operating income before depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation expense in would have had an immaterial impact on our reported results 
using the average foreign currency exchange rates from  our international revenues for would have been lower than we reported by approximately million and our international segment operating income before depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation expense would have been lower than we reported by million 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we convert the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries and our investments in equity interests into united states dollars in consolidation 
if there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates  the conversion of the foreign subsidiaries financial statements into united states dollars will lead to a translation gain or loss which is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income which is part of stockholders equity 
in addition  we have certain assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the relevant entity s functional currency 
changes in the functional currency value of these assets and liabilities create fluctuations that will lead to a transaction gain or loss 
in the year ended december   we recorded net foreign currency transaction gains  realized and unrealized  of approximately million  net losses of million and net gains of million in and  respectively  which were recorded in other income  net on the consolidated statements of income 
investment risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and current and long term investments in a variety of securities  including both government and corporate obligations and money market funds 
as of december  and  net unrealized losses on these investments were not material 
we are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our investments 
we invest in equity instruments of public companies for business and strategic purposes and have classified these securities as available for sale 
these available for sale equity investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the stock market and the industries in which these companies participate 
we have realized gains and losses from the sale of investments  as well as impairment charges on some of our investments 
in  we recorded an impairment loss of million on an available for sale equity investment  compared to million recorded in our investments in available for sale equity securities were not material as of december  and our objective in managing exposure to stock market fluctuations is to minimize the impact of stock market declines to earnings and cash flows 
using a hypothetical reduction of percent in the stock price of these equity securities  the fair value of our equity investments would decrease by approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively
