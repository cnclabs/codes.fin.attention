item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general we are a self administered and self managed reit and we primarily own real estate that we net lease to tenants 
as of december   we owned properties  including a tenancy in common interest in one property  and participated in seven joint ventures that owned a total of six properties including two vacant properties held for sale 
these properties are located in states 
we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended 
to qualify as a reit  we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that we currently distribute at least of ordinary taxable income to our stockholders 
we intend to comply with these requirements and to maintain our reit status 
our principal business strategy is to acquire improved  commercial properties subject to long term net leases 
we acquire properties for their value as long term investments and for their ability to generate income over an extended period of time 
we have borrowed funds in the past to finance the purchase of real estate and we expect to do so in the future 
our rental properties are generally leased to corporate tenants under operating leases substantially all of which are noncancellable 
substantially all of our lease agreements are net lease arrangements that require the tenant to pay not only rent  but also substantially all of the operating expenses of the leased property  including maintenance  taxes  utilities and insurance 
a majority of our lease agreements provide for periodic rental increases and certain of our other leases provide for increases based on the consumer price index 
during the year ended december   we purchased single tenant properties located in states  for a total consideration of million 
these purchases include our april acquisition of properties for a consideration of million that are net leased to a single tenant under a master lease 
an aggregate of million of first mortgage financing was completed with respect to ten of these properties and we assumed a pre existing first mortgage loan of million on the properties purchased in april we are a venturer in two joint ventures organized for the purpose of acquiring and owning megaplex stadium style movie theaters 
we own a equity interest and are the managing member in each of these ventures with the same co venturer 
one of our movie theater joint ventures sold all five of its movie theater properties in october for million and realized a gain of million on the sale  after the payment of closing expenses and brokerage fees 
in connection with this sale  the joint venture paid million in prepayment premiums to its mortgage lender  which is reflected as interest expense on the books of the joint venture and not netted against the gain on sale 
this movie theater joint venture does not currently own any real property 
the second movie theater joint venture sold one movie theater property in september for million and three movie theater properties in october for million  and realized an aggregate gain of million on the sales  after the payment of closing expenses and brokerage fees 
in connection with these sales  the joint venture paid million in prepayment premiums to its mortgage lenders  which is reflected as interest expense and not netted against the gain on sale 
at december   the second movie theater joint venture owned one property  
of an acre of vacant land located in monroe  new york and sold this property in march our equity investment in these joint ventures at december  was  net of distributions 
as of december   we are also a joint venturer in five additional joint ventures  each of which owns one single tenanted property 
our equity investment in these five joint ventures at december  was million  net of distributions 
at december   excluding mortgages payable of our unconsolidated joint ventures  we had outstanding mortgages payable  aggregating million in principal amount  all of which are secured by first liens on individual real estate investments with an aggregate carrying value  as adjusted for intangibles  of approximately million before accumulated depreciation 
the mortgages bear interest at fixed rates ranging from to  and mature between and in addition  we had one loan payable outstanding with a principal amount of million  bearing interest at and maturing in results of operations outlook we anticipate that in we will use any available cash after taking into account required cash distributions to shareholders  funds derived from the placement of additional mortgages and a credit line to acquire additional properties  either directly or through joint ventures 
as a result  we anticipate that we will acquire and own additional properties and unless we experience an unexpected number of lease terminations and or cancellations in taking into consideration the lease expirations and terminations that we know will occur in  and without giving effect to any re letting of such properties  we anticipate that our revenues will increase in comparison of years ended december  and december  rental revenues rental revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in rental revenues is substantially due to rental revenues earned during the year ended december  on properties acquired by us between january and december operating expenses depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in depreciation and amortization was due to the acquisition of properties between january and december general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was due to a number of factors  including a  increase in payroll and payroll related expenses resulting primarily from compensation paid to our president elected effective january  for all of  while we did not have any payroll expenses for our president for five months in  as well as from staff increases 
an increase of  relates to professional fees incurred in connection with an investigation by the securities and exchange commission described elsewhere in this report part i item legal proceedings and investigations by our audit committee

federal excise tax of  was accrued at december   based on taxable income generated but not yet distributed 
there was no such tax for the year ended december  real estate expenses decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december   resulting primarily from unusual repair items incurred in the year ended december  at three properties 
other income and expenses our equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures decreased by million  or  to a loss of million for the year ended december  from income of million for the year ended december  this decrease resulted primarily from million of prepayment premiums  of which  or million is our share  paid by two of our joint ventures upon the sales of its nine movie theater properties 
such sales also contributed to an operating income decrease from these ventures of million  of which  is our share  caused by a decrease in rental income  offset in part by a decrease in mortgage interest expense and depreciation 
the decrease in earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures also resulted from a  provision for valuation adjustment  of which  or  was our share  by one of our joint ventures which owns a vacant property 
these decreases were offset  in part  by a million provision for valuation adjustment taken in the year ended december  by one of our movie theater joint ventures against its vacant parcel of land  of which  or million  was our share

this sale was part of a sale which closed on october  pursuant to which an unrelated party purchased one movie theater from us and eight movie theaters from two of our joint ventures 
this increase was offset in part by net gains of million in the year ended december  on the sale of five of our properties 
the increase in discontinued operations also resulted from an increase in income from operations caused by a  provision for valuation adjustment that was recorded in the year ended december  against one of the properties which was sold later in that year 
comparison of years ended december  and december  rental revenues rental revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in rental revenues is substantially due to rental revenues earned during the year ended december  on fourteen properties acquired by us between march and november operating expenses depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in depreciation and amortization was due to the acquisition of fourteen properties between march and november general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was due to a number of factors  the largest of which totaling  and representing approximately of the increase relates to the fees of special counsel retained by our audit committee in connection with its investigation into certain financial dealings of our former president and chief executive officer

the decrease in our equity in earnings of joint ventures year versus year was also a result of the vacancy due to the rejection of the lease by the bankrupt tenant of a retail property owned by a joint venture in which we have a equity position  and the sale in by this venture of its bankruptcy claim against the former tenant 
the decrease in our equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures was offset in part by our share of income earned by two joint ventures organized in the second half of additionally  in  the operator of one of the movie theaters owned by one of our joint ventures sold its business to an independent third party  which sale resulted in the payment to us in of rental arrearages totaling  we have a interest in this joint venture and the payment resulted in an additional  in equity earnings to us for the year ended december  an additional increase in equity earnings to us in resulted from rent payments from the new tenant of this movie theater and the write off during the year ended december  of the entire balance of the unbilled rent receivable relating to this movie theater 
interest and other income decreased by  or to  for the year ended december  the primary reason for the decrease was the receipt by us in of  of net acquisition fees from a joint venture we organized in that year 
the net acquisition fee reflects a reduction based on our ownership in the joint venture 
this decrease was offset  in part  by an increase of  in interest income earned in from the investment of funds obtained from mortgage financings and property sales 
interest expense increased by million  or  million of which resulted from mortgages placed on twelve properties between september and december and the assumption of a mortgage in connection with the purchase of one property in november the increases were offset by a  decrease in interest on a mortgage which was paid in full at its maturity during may interest expense related to our line of credit increased by  due to borrowings made to facilitate the purchase of several properties

liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents  our revolving credit facility and cash generated from operating activities  including mortgage financings 
we are a party to a credit agreement  as amended  with vnb new york corp  bank leumi  usa  manufacturers and traders trust company and israel discount bank of new york which provides for a million revolving credit facility 
the credit facility is available to us to pay down existing mortgages  to fund the acquisition of additional properties or to invest in joint ventures

net proceeds received from the sale or refinancing of properties are required to be used to repay amounts outstanding under the facility if proceeds from the facility were used to purchase or refinance the property 
the facility is guaranteed by our subsidiaries that own unencumbered properties and is secured by the outstanding stock of subsidiary entities 
as of december  and as of march   there is no outstanding balance under the facility 
we are in the process of amending our credit facility which will extend the maturity date from march  to march  and will reduce the interest rate from its current rate to the lower of libor plus or the bank s prime rate 
all other material terms and conditions contained in our current credit facility will remain the same 
we will pay a commitment fee and other expenses of approximately  in connection with this amendment 
we are actively engaged in seeking additional property acquisitions and are involved in various stages of negotiation with respect to the acquisition of additional net leased properties 
we will use our available cash and cash equivalents  cash provided from operations  cash provided from mortgage financings and funds available under our credit facility to fund acquisitions 
the following sets forth our contractual cash obligations as of december   which relate to interest and amortization payments and balances due at maturity under outstanding mortgages secured by our properties for the periods indicated amounts in thousands caption payment due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years 
del mortgages and loan payable interest and amortization      mortgages and loan payable balances due at maturity      total  del 
as of december   we had outstanding approximately million in long term mortgage and loan indebtedness excluding mortgage indebtedness of our unconsolidated joint ventures  all of which is non recourse subject to standard carve outs 
we expect that debt service payments of approximately million due in the next three years will be paid primarily from cash generated from our operations 
we anticipate that loan maturities of approximately million due in the next three years will be paid primarily from mortgage financings or refinancings 
if we are not successful in refinancing our existing indebtedness or financing our unencumbered properties  our cash flow  funds available under our credit facility and available cash  if any  may not be sufficient to repay all maturing debt when payments become due  and we may be forced to sell additional equity or dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms 
in addition  we  as ground lessee  are obligated to pay rent under a ground lease for a property owned in fee by an unrelated third party 
the annual fixed leasehold rent expense is as follows more than total years     we had no outstanding contingent commitments  such as guarantees of indebtedness  or any other contractual cash obligations at december  cash distribution policy we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended 
to qualify as a reit  we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that we distribute currently at least of our ordinary taxable income to our stockholders 
it is our current intention to comply with these requirements and maintain our reit status 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to corporate federal  state or local income taxes on taxable income we distribute currently in accordance with the internal revenue code and applicable regulations to our stockholders 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal  state and local income taxes at regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a reit for four subsequent tax years 
even if we qualify for federal taxation as a reit  we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and to federal income taxes on our undistributed taxable income ie  taxable income not distributed in the amounts and in the time frames prescribed by the internal revenue code and applicable regulations thereunder and are subject to federal excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income 
it is our intention to pay to our stockholders within the time periods prescribed by the internal revenue code no less than  and  if possible  of our annual taxable income  including taxable gains from the sale of real estate and recognized gains on the sale of securities 
it will continue to be our policy to make sufficient cash distributions to stockholders in order for us to maintain our reit status under the internal revenue code 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
significant accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to an understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management  as a result they are subject to a degree of uncertainty 
these significant accounting policies include revenues our revenues  which are substantially derived from rental income  include rental income that our tenants pay in accordance with the terms of their respective leases reported on a straight line basis over the initial term of each lease 
since many of our leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals  straight line basis accounting requires us to record as an asset and include in revenues  unbilled rent receivables which we will only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease 
accordingly  our management must determine  in its judgment  that the unbilled rent receivable applicable to each specific tenant is collectible 
we review unbilled rent receivables on a quarterly basis and take into consideration the tenant s payment history  the financial condition of the tenant  business conditions in the industry in which the tenant is engaged and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located 
in the event that the collectability of an unbilled rent receivable is in doubt  we would be required to take a reserve against the receivable or a direct write off of the receivable  which would have an adverse affect on net income for the year in which the reserve or direct write off is taken and would decrease total assets and stockholders equity 
value of real estate portfolio we review our real estate portfolio on a quarterly basis to ascertain if there has been any impairment in the value of any of our real estate assets in order to determine if there is any need for a provision for valuation adjustment 
in reviewing the portfolio  we examine the type of asset  the economic situation in the area in which the asset is located  the economic situation in the industry in which the tenant is involved and the timeliness of the payments made by the tenant under its lease  as well as any current correspondence that may have been had with the tenant  including property inspection reports 
for each real estate asset owned for which indicators of impairment exist  recognition of impairment is required if the calculated value is less than the asset s carrying amount 
we generally do not obtain any independent appraisals in determining value but rely on our own analysis and valuations 
any provision taken with respect to any part of our real estate portfolio will reduce our net income and reduce assets and stockholders equity to the extent of the amount of the valuation adjustment  but it will not affect our cash flow until such time as the property is sold 
purchase accounting for acquisition of real estate the fair value of the real estate acquired is allocated to the acquired tangible assets  consisting of land and building  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases and other value of in place leases based in each case on their fair values 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property which includes land and building is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant  and the as if vacant value is then allocated to land and building based on management s determination of relative fair values of these assets 
the allocation made by management may have a positive or negative effect on net income and may have an effect on the assets and liabilities on the balance sheet 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
all of our long term mortgage debt bears interest at fixed rates and accordingly  the effect of changes in interest rates would not impact the amount of interest expense that we incur under these mortgages 
our credit line is a variable rate facility which is sensitive to interest rates 
therefore  our primary market risk exposure is the effect of changes in interest rates on the interest cost of draws on our line of credit 
under current market conditions  we do not believe that our risk of material potential losses in future earnings  fair values and or cash flows from near term changes in market rates that we consider reasonably possible is material 
the fair market value fmv of our long term debt is estimated based on discounting future cash flows at interest rates that our management believes reflect the risks associated with long term debt of similar risk and duration 
the following table sets forth our long term debt obligations by scheduled principal cash flow payments and maturity date  weighted average interest rates and estimated fmv at december  amounts in thousands caption for the year ended december there after total fmv
