overview operating results 
during  the combination of high commodity prices and record annual production resulted in record annual earnings and cash flow from operations 
production for averaged  boe d  higher than our average production during  with production increases in every operating area 
commodity prices  on a boe basis net to us  increased between the fiscal year end and virtually all expenses increased during  on both an absolute and per boe basis  as we experienced cost increases in almost every aspect of our business 
overall industry costs continue to increase  the primary reason for higher operating costs and depreciation and depletion rates per boe in operating expenses were also impacted by higher energy costs electrical and fuel charges and our continuing emphasis on tertiary operations 
general and administrative expenses increased between and primarily as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r relating to stock compensation and continued growth in personnel and inflation in the industry 
interest expense increased as a result of average debt levels that were higher than in  partially offset by million of capitalized interest expense  primarily relating to the unevaluated properties included in our acquisitions 
our commodity derivative contract mark to market adjustments were the only positive trend in expenses during  wherein we recognized a million gain in  as compared to a million loss in our derivative gain was primarily a result of our decision to enter into natural gas swaps in mid december covering between and of our forecasted natural gas production  followed by a decline in natural gas prices by year end 
as has been our practice for several years  we are reinvesting virtually all of our cash flow in new projects  with a desire to further increase our production and reserves 
during  our proved reserves increased from mmboe as of december  to mmboe as of december   replacing approximately of our production  over of which was from internal organic growth  with the balance from acquisitions 
the most significant reserve additions during were in the barnett shale 
we did not recognize many tertiary oil reserve additions during because of delays in getting projects completed and the related delays in associated production response and because of a transition in how proved tertiary oil reserves were being recognized see results of operations depletion  depreciation and amortization for a review of our reserve changes during and a discussion of our proved tertiary reserves 
net income for was million as compared to million for and million for the incremental net income during the was attributable to most of the factors noted above  principally higher production  partially offset by higher costs 
continued high commodity prices during also played a significant role in the results 
in addition to inflationary costs in our industry  we are experiencing more and more delays in obtaining goods and services 
this industry trend has caused us to experience higher costs than originally forecasted and to periodically fall behind schedule with regard to the timing of planned activities 
while there are preliminary signs that these trends are slowing as a result of the decline in commodity prices in late  unless commodity prices remain flat or continue to decrease  we believe that we are likely to see a resumption of these trends 
these rising costs  both for operating expenses and capital expenditures  and shortages of goods and services  contribute to delays in completing our planned projects and may cause delays and shortfalls in achieving our anticipated production and profitability targets 
see results of operations for a more thorough discussion of our operating results 
continued expansion of our tertiary operations 
since we acquired our first carbon dioxide tertiary flood in mississippi in  we have gradually increased our emphasis on these types of operations 
we particularly like this 
table of contents denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations play because of its risk profile  rate of return and lack of competition in our operating area 
generally  from east texas to florida  there are no known significant natural sources of carbon dioxide except our own  and these large volumes of co that we own drive the play 
please refer to the section entitled co operations below for a discussion of these operations  their potential  and the ramifications of our continuing emphasis on these operations 
having enough co 

to flood our tertiary oil fields is one of the most important ingredients  if not the key ingredient  to our tertiary operations 
during we increased our proved co reserve quantities by  from tcf as of december   to approximately tcf as of december  both of these quantities are on a working interest basis see co operations co 

resources for further information 
we are continuing to buy additional oil fields that are tertiary flood candidates see acquisitions below 
acquisitions 
tinsley and citronelle fields 
on january   we completed an acquisition of three producing oil properties that are future potential co tertiary oil flood candidates tinsley field approximately miles northwest of jackson  mississippi  citronelle field in southwest alabama  and the smaller south cypress creek field near the company s eucutta field in eastern mississippi 
in we began our tertiary development work at tinsley field  consisting primarily of planning  land and engineering work  with more extensive development and facility construction planned for the timing of tertiary development at citronelle field is uncertain as we will need to build a to mile extension of our free state pipeline co pipeline from jackson dome to east mississippi before flooding can commence  and south cypress creek will probably be flooded following our initial development of our other east mississippi properties 
the adjusted purchase price for these three properties was approximately million 
the acquisition was funded with proceeds of the million of senior subordinated notes issued in december and million of bank financing under the company s existing credit facility repaid in april with proceeds from our equity offering at that time 
during the fourth quarter of  these fields produced an average of  boe d  up slightly from the  boe d at the time of acquisition 
as of december   these fields had proved reserves of approximately million boes 
we operate all three fields and own the majority of the working interests 
delhi field 
during may  we purchased the delhi holt bryant unit delhi in northern louisiana for million  plus a reversionary interest to the seller after we have achieved million in net operating revenue  as defined 
delhi is also a future potential co tertiary oil flood candidate that will require construction of a co pipeline before flooding can commence  with current plans to make such a line an extension of the larger  new co pipeline currently planned from jackson dome to tinsley field 
our goal is to have this co line installed by  with initial oil production from tertiary operations currently anticipated during no significant oil production or proved oil reserves existed at delhi field at december  hastings field 
during november we entered into an agreement with a subsidiary of venoco  inc that gives us an option  between november  and november   to purchase their interest in hastings field  a strategically significant potential tertiary flood candidate located near houston  texas 
the agreement provides for the parties to agree upon a purchase price for the conventional proved reserves at the time of the exercise of the option  which may be paid in cash or through a volumetric production payment  failing an agreement as to price  the price will be determined by a pre designated independent petroleum engineering firm using specified criteria for calculation of the discounted present value of proved reserves at that time 
as consideration for the option agreement  we made an upfront payment of million and are required to make additional payments totaling million over the next twenty months 
we can extend the option period beyond november for up to seven additional years at an incremental cost of million per year 
none of the option payment amounts will be credited against the purchase price if we exercise the option 
if we exercise the option  we will be committed to make aggregate net capital expenditures in the field of approximately million over the subsequent five years to develop the field for tertiary operations  with an obligation to commence co injections in the field within three years following the option exercise 
hastings field is currently producing approximately  bbls d  although we currently have no economic interest in this production 
we believe that hastings field has significant potential oil reserves from tertiary flooding 
we plan to build a pipeline to transport co to this field  estimated at between and miles  from the southern end of our existing co pipeline which terminates near donaldsonville  louisiana 
based on very preliminary estimates  this pipeline is expected to cost between million and million  although this cost could vary significantly depending on the ultimate size of the pipeline  its pressure rating  its specific route  and other variables  all of which are unknown 
table of contents denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations at this time 
we are initiating studies related to construction of this line  with a goal of having it installed and operational within the next few years 
we anticipate initially transporting co to the hastings field from our natural co source at jackson dome  but ultimately plan to use manufactured anthropogenic sources of co for this tertiary operation 
see results of operations co resources for a discussion of an agreement we entered into during to purchase a man made source of co from a planned petroleum coke gasification project 
april equity offering 
on april   we closed the million sale net to denbury of  shares of common stock in a public offering 
we used the net proceeds from the offering to repay then current borrowings under our bank credit facility  which were million as of that date  principally incurred to partially fund our million acquisition of three properties in january capital resources and liquidity our current capital budget is million  excluding any potential acquisitions 
approximately of our budget is expected to be spent on tertiary related operations  approximately in the barnett shale area  and less than on exploration projects  with the balance spent on our conventional properties in mississippi or louisiana 
this capital program includes an estimated million to million for a co pipeline from our co source at jackson dome to tinsley and delhi fields  two oil fields acquired during based on futures commodity prices as of the end of january  this budget is million to million greater than our anticipated cash flow from operations  a much greater shortfall than we have had in recent years 
currently  we plan to fund the majority of this shortfall by refinancing our two existing co pipelines with genesis energy  co genesis by entering into some type of long term financing or sale transaction  effectively paying for the cost of the pipeline over an extended period of time and recouping our cash previously spent 
we would anticipate a similar financing with genesis for the new co pipeline from jackson dome to tinsley and delhi fields once it is completed  forecasted at this time to be during the first half of we have discussed with genesis that any such financings are conditioned upon genesis achieving certain goals  primarily the acquisition of other economic projects that are not related to denbury  based upon acquisition by genesis of of non denbury related acquisitions for every of financings or sales with denbury 
if genesis is not successful in acquiring properties from third parties or we cannot reach mutually agreeable terms with genesis to sell them these co pipeline assets  we would plan to fund the shortfall with conventional debt and could potentially reduce our capital budget later in the year 
as of february   we had million of bank debt outstanding on a million borrowing base see revised bank credit agreement below  leaving us significant incremental borrowing capacity  more than we currently plan or desire to use 
we monitor our capital expenditures on a regular basis  adjusting them up or down depending on commodity prices and the resultant cash flow 
therefore  during the last few years as commodity prices have increased  we have increased our capital budget throughout the year 
as a result of the recent cost inflation in our industry  many of our recent budget increases have related to escalating costs rather than additional projects 
in this inflationary environment  we often have to either increase our capital budget or consider the elimination of a portion of our planned projects 
we also continue to pursue additional acquisitions of mature oil fields that we believe have potential as future tertiary flood candidates 
these possible acquisitions are difficult to forecast and the purchase price can vary widely depending on the levels in the fields of existing production and conventional proved reserves and commodity prices 
any additional acquisitions would be funded  at least temporarily  with bank or other debt  although if significant  the acquisition would likely be ultimately funded with more permanent capital such as subordinated debt and or additional equity 
revised bank credit agreement 
on september   we entered into a sixth amended and restated credit agreement with our nine banks  led by jpmorgan chase bank  na  as administrative agent 
the new agreement i improved the credit pricing under the agreement  ii extended the term of the credit arrangements by two and one half years to september   iii increased the borrowing base from million to million  iv increased the maximum facility size from million to million  and v made other minor modifications 
under the new agreement  the commitment amount remained at million  an amount increased in december to million 
the borrowing base represents the amount that can be borrowed from a credit standpoint based on our assets  as confirmed by the banks  while the commitment amount is the amount the banks have committed to fund pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement 
the banks have the option to participate in 
table of contents denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations any borrowing request by us in excess of the commitment amount million  up to the borrowing base limit million  although the banks are not obligated to fund any amount in excess of the commitment amount 
at december   we had outstanding million principal amount of subordinated notes  approximately million of capital lease commitments  million of bank debt  and a working capital deficit of approximately million 
sources and uses of capital resources during  we spent million on oil and natural gas exploration and development  million on co exploration and development  and approximately million on property acquisitions  for total capital expenditures of approximately million 
our oil and natural gas exploration and development expenditures included approximately million spent on drilling  million spent on geological  geophysical and acreage expenditures and million incurred on facilities and recompletion costs 
we funded our total capital expenditures with million of cash flow from operations  million of equity  million of net bank borrowings  and a million increase in our accrued capital expenditures  with the balance funded with working capital  predominately cash from the december issuance of million of subordinated debt 
adjusted cash flow from operations a non gaap measure defined as cash flow from operations before changes in assets and liabilities as discussed below under results of operations operating results was million for  while cash flow from operations for the same period  the gaap measure  was million 
during  we spent million on oil and natural gas exploration and development expenditures  million on co exploration and development expenditures including approximately million for our co pipeline to east mississippi  and approximately million on property acquisitions  for total capital expenditures of approximately million 
our exploration and development expenditures included approximately million spent on drilling  million of geological  geophysical and acreage expenditures and million spent on facilities and recompletion costs 
our acquisition expenditures include the purchase of additional interest and acreage in the barnett shale area and purchase of two oil fields  cranfield and lake st 
john fields  which may be potential tertiary flood candidates in the future 
our million of capital expenditures included an increase of million in our accrued capital expenditures  with the remaining cash portion of our capital expenditures funded primarily with million of cash flow from operations and approximately million of short term investments remaining at december   from the sale of our offshore properties during additionally  we issued million of subordinated debt in december and raised million during from the sale of another volumetric production payment of co to genesis  along with a related long term co supply agreement with an industrial customer 
all of these sources not only funded our capital expenditures  but also increased our cash balance at year end to million  with a portion of such funds used in january to partially fund our million acquisition

long term contracts require us to deliver co to our industrial co customers at various contracted prices  plus we have a co delivery obligation to genesis pursuant to three volumetric production payments vpp entered into during through based upon the maximum amounts deliverable as stated in the industrial contracts and the volumetric production payments  we estimate that we may be obligated to deliver up to bcf of co to these customers over the next years  however  since the group as a whole has historically taken less co than the maximum allowed in their contracts  based on the current level of deliveries  currently we project that our commitment would likely be reduced to approximately bcf 
the maximum volume required in any given year is approximately mmcf d  although based on our current level of deliveries  this would likely be reduced to approximately mmcf d 
given the size of our proven co reserves at december  approximately tcf before deducting approximately bcf for the three vpps  our current production capabilities and our projected levels of co usage for our own tertiary flooding program  we believe that we will be able to meet these delivery obligations 
results of operations co operations overview 
our interest in tertiary operations has increased to the point that approximately of our capital budget is dedicated to tertiary related operations 
we particularly like this play as i it has a lower risk and is more predictable than most traditional exploration and development activities  ii it provides a reasonable rate of return at relatively low oil prices generally around a barrel at today s cost levels  depending on the specific field and area  and iii we have virtually no competition for this type of activity in our geographic area 
generally  from east texas to florida  there are no known significant natural sources of carbon dioxide except our own  and these large volumes of co 

that we own drive the play 
we talk about our tertiary operations by labeling operating areas or groups of fields as phases 
phase i is in southwest mississippi and includes several fields along our mile co 

pipeline that we acquired in the 
table of contents denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations most significant fields in this area are little creek  mallalieu  mccomb and brookhaven 
phase ii  which began with the early completion of our co 

pipeline to east mississippi  includes eucutta  soso  martinville and heidelberg fields 
with the properties acquired in our january acquisition see acquisitions above  we have labeled the planned operations at tinsley field  northwest of jackson dome  as phase iii 
phase iv includes cranfield and lake st 
john fields  two fields near the mississippi louisiana border located west of the phase i fields  and phase v is delhi field  a louisiana field we acquired in  located southwest of tinsley field see acquisitions 
ultimately  we also plan to ultimately flood citronelle field  another field acquired in  and hastings field  a field on which we acquired a purchase option in late we have not yet labeled these two fields as a specific phase 
co 

resources 
in february  we acquired the co source field located near jackson  mississippi  and a mile pipeline to transport it to our oil fields 
since february  we have acquired two producing wells and drilled additional co 

producing wells  significantly increasing our estimated proved co reserves from approximately bcf at the time of the acquisition to approximately tcf as of december   approximately bcf more than we estimate we need for our existing and currently planned phases of tertiary operations 
during  our proven co reserves increased approximately  or bcf  from tcf to tcf 
the estimate of tcf of proved co reserves is based on ownership of the co reserves  of which denbury s net revenue interest ownership is approximately tcf 
both reserve estimates are included in the evaluation of proven co reserves prepared by degolyer macnaughton 
in discussing the available co reserves  we make reference to the gross amount of proved reserves  as this is the amount that is available both for denbury s tertiary recovery programs and industrial users  as denbury is responsible for distributing the entire co production stream for both of these uses 
we currently estimate that it will take approximately bcf of co to develop and produce the proved tertiary recovery reserves we have recorded at december  today  we own every known producing co well in the region  providing us a significant strategic advantage in the acquisition of other properties in mississippi and louisiana that could be further exploited through tertiary recovery 
as of january  we estimate that we are capable of producing approximately mmcf d of co  over seven times the rate that we were capable of producing at the time of our initial acquisition in we continue to drill additional co wells  with three more wells planned for  in order to further increase our production capacity and potentially increase our proven co reserves 
our drilling activity at jackson dome will continue beyond as our current forecasts for the five phases which are specifically planned to date suggest that we will need approximately  mmcf d of co production by in addition to using co for our tertiary operations  we sell co to third party industrial users under long term contracts 
most of these industrial contracts have been sold to genesis along with the sale of a volumetric production payment for the co our average daily co production during  and was approximately million  million  and million cubic feet per day  of which approximately in  in  and in was used in our tertiary recovery operations  with the balance delivered to genesis under the volumetric production payments or sold to third party industrial users 
we spent approximately per mcf in operating expenses to produce our co 

during  more than our average of per mcf  principally as a result of higher oil commodity prices  which results in higher royalty payments  and higher labor  utilities and equipment rental expense 
during  we spent approximately per mcf to produce our co 
our estimated total cost per thousand cubic feet of co during was approximately  after inclusion of depreciation and amortization expense related to the co production  as compared to approximately during man made co sources 
we entered into an agreement and committed to purchase if the plant is built of the co 

production from a man made anthropogenic source of co  
a planned petroleum coke gasification project scheduled to be completed in this faustina plant  proposed to be located near donaldsonville  la  will convert petroleum coke into ammonia 
as a byproduct of the combustion  large quantities of co will be produced  estimated to be around mmcf d 
we plan to use this co in our tertiary operations program to recover oil 
the faustina agreement allows us to add the potential equivalent volume of an additional one tcf of co over the term of our contract 
construction of this plant has not yet begun  so we are not certain whether this plant will be built  although it currently appears likely 
we are in discussions with several other entities that are considering other types of coal or petroleum coke gasification plants 
the cost of this man made co 

will 
table of contents denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations likely be higher than co 

from our natural source  but the location of these plants could mitigate some of the incremental cost of transporting co from jackson dome 
further  we see these sources as a possible expansion of natural sources  assuming they are economical  and we believe that our potential ability to tie these sources together with pipelines will give us a significant advantage over our competitors in our geographic area in acquiring additional oil fields and in acquiring these future potential man made sources of co overview of tertiary economics 
initially  our tertiary operations were economic at oil prices below per bbl  although the economics have always varied by field 
our costs have escalated during the last few years due to general cost inflation in the industry  raising our current economic oil price to around per bbl  again dependent on the specific field 
our inception to date finding and development costs including future development and abandonment costs but excluding expenditures on fields without proven reserves for our tertiary oil fields through december   are approximately per boe 
currently  we forecast that these costs will range from to per boe over the life of each field  depending on the state of a particular field at the time we begin operations  the amount of potential oil  the proximity to a pipeline or other facilities  etc 
our operating costs for tertiary operations are expected to range from to per boe over the life of each field at today s prices  again depending on the field itself  however  our operating costs were in excess of this range 
oil quality is another significant factor that impacts the economics 
in phase i southwest mississippi  the light sweet oil produced from our tertiary operations receives near nymex prices  while the average discount to nymex for the lower quality oil produced from the fields in phase ii east mississippi  some of which we started flooding during  was per boe during  a differential that is significantly higher than our corporate historical averages and one that appears to increase as oil prices increase 
see oil and natural gas revenues below for a further discussion of our nymex differentials 
while these economic factors have wide ranges  our rate of return from these operations has generally been better than our rate of return on traditional oil and gas operations  and thus our tertiary operations have become our single most important focus area 
while it is extremely difficult to accurately forecast future production  we do believe that our tertiary recovery operations provide significant long term production growth potential at reasonable rates of return  with relatively low risk  and thus will be the backbone of our company s growth for the foreseeable future 
although we believe that our plans and projections are reasonable and achievable  there could be delays or unforeseen problems in the future that could delay or affect the economics of our overall tertiary development program 
we believe that such delays or price effects  if any  should only be temporary 
financial statement impact of co operations 
our increasing emphasis on co tertiary recovery projects has significantly impacted  and will continue to impact on our financial results and certain operating statistics 
first  there is a significant delay between the initial capital expenditures and operating expenses and the resulting production increases  as we must build facilities before co flooding can commence  and it usually takes six to months before the field responds to the injection of co co  oil production commences to the injection of co further  we may spend significant amounts of capital before we can recognize any proven reserves from fields we flood see analysis of tertiary recovery operations below 
even after a field has proven reserves  there will usually be significant amounts of additional capital required to fully develop the field 
secondly  these tertiary projects are usually more expensive to operate than our other oil fields because of the cost of injecting and recycling the co primarily due to the significant energy requirements to re compress the co back into a near liquid state for re injection purposes 
as commodity and energy prices increase  so do our operating expenses in these fields 
our operating cost during for our tertiary operations averaged per bbl for our producing tertiary fields  as compared to an estimated cost of around to per boe for a more traditional oil property 
we allocate the cost to produce and transport the co between co used in our own oil fields and co sold to commercial users including obligations covered by the volumetric production payments sold to genesis 
most of our co operating expenses are allocated to our oil fields and recorded as lease operating expenses on those fields at the time the co is injected 
since we expense all of the operating costs to produce and inject our co  the operating costs per barrel will be higher at the inception of co injection projects before oil production is realized in a particular field 
our total corporate operating expenses on a per boe basis will likely continue to increase as these operations constitute an increasingly larger percentage of our operations 
generally  these higher operating costs are somewhat offset by lower finding and development costs which helps to lower our overall depreciation and depletion rate see also overview of tertiary economics above 

table of contents denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations third  our net oil price relative to nymex prices may be affected by the oil produced from our tertiary operations see overview of tertiary operations above 
currently  all of our current oil production from tertiary operations is from fields that produce light sweet oil and receive oil prices close to  and sometimes actually higher than  nymex prices 
however  the oil produced from fields that we recently commenced flooding as part of phase ii generally sell at a significant discount to nymex because of the quality of the crude oil there 
the relative mix of this production  coupled with changing market conditions for the various types of crude  can cause our nymex differentials to fluctuate widely 
analysis of co tertiary recovery operating activities 
we currently have tertiary operations ongoing at little creek  mallalieu  mccomb and brookhaven fields in phase i and soso  martinville and eucutta fields in phase ii  as well as in various smaller adjacent fields 
we project that our oil production from these operations will increase substantially over the next several years as we continue to expand this program by adding additional projects and phases 
as of december   we had approximately mmbbls of proven oil reserves related to tertiary operations mmbbls of which was in phase i and the balance in phase ii and have identified and estimate significant additional oil potential in other fields that we own in this region 
we initiated co 

injections at tinsley field phase iii in january  although in very limited amounts  with more significant development expected there when the co pipeline to tinsley is completed  which we currently anticipate in the third or fourth quarter of we also expect to initiate flooding at cranfield and lockhart crossing fields in the second half of phase iv 
with regard to our proven tertiary reserves  was a transition year for us  as we added only mmbbls of tertiary related proved oil reserves during the year  primarily incremental oil reserves at mccomb and mallalieu fields both phase i 
previously  we booked most proven tertiary oil reserves near the start of a project as almost all the oil fields in phase i were analogous to little creek field our first flood and thus it was not necessary to have an oil production response to the co injections before they were considered proven 
conversely  our new floods after phase i are not analogous for the most part  as the tertiary floods will be in different geological formations 
therefore for these new phases  there must be an oil production response to the co injections before we can recognize proven oil reserves  even though we believe that these formations have a similar risk profile 
since many of our phase ii projects were delayed during  the production response needed to record any significant incremental tertiary oil reserves in this new area did not take place 
we anticipate booking significant amounts of proven tertiary oil reserves during and beyond  although the magnitude will depend on our progress with phases iii and iv  two areas we plan to initiate during  and the response from our new phase ii projects 
our average annual oil production from our co 

tertiary recovery activities has increased during the last few years  from  bbls d in to  bbls d during tertiary oil production represented approximately of our total corporate oil production during and approximately of our total corporate production of both oil and natural gas during the same period on a boe basis 
we expect that this tertiary related oil production will continue to increase  although the increases are not always predictable or consistent 
during  our co injections were less than we forecasted due to a series of different types of delays in obtaining equipment or completing facilities  resulting in a corresponding shortfall between our forecasted and actual tertiary oil production 
these delays are caused by various factors difficulties reentering certain injection wells  which has required that some wells be redrilled  delays in getting certain permits and right of ways  and a general tightening of available materials and equipment in the industry 
this temporary fluctuation in oil production does not indicate any issue with the proved and potential oil reserves recoverable with co  because the historical correlation between oil production and co injections remains high 
for our tertiary oil production  we anticipate a to increase in our average production rates for as compared to levels 
a detailed discussion of each of our tertiary oil fields and the development of each is included on pages under our tertiary oil fields with proven tertiary reserves

we also lease a portion of our recycling and plant equipment used in our tertiary operations  which further increases operating expenses 
over the last four years we have leased certain equipment that qualifies for operating lease treatment representing an underlying aggregate cost of approximately million as of december  we expect to enter into new leases for equipment during and representing additional underlying costs of approximately million 
these leases have been an attractive cost of financing due to their low imputed interest rates  which are fixed for seven to ten years

approximately million in capital expenditures is budgeted in for our phase ii properties east mississippi and approximately million for phase iii properties tinsley  plus an additional million for properties in other phases  making our combined co related expenditures just over of our million capital budget 
operating results adjusted cash flow from operations see discussion below regarding this non gaap measure and net income have increased each year during the last three years  along with rising commodity prices

cash flow from operations is the gaap measure as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
in our discussion herein  we have elected to discuss these two components of cash flow provided by operations 
adjusted cash flow from operations  the non gaap measure  measures the cash flow earned or incurred from operating activities without regard to the collection or payment of associated receivables or payables 
we believe that it is important to consider adjusted cash flow from operations separately  as we believe it can often be a better way to discuss changes in operating trends in our business caused by changes in production  prices  operating costs  and related operational factors  without regard to whether the earned or incurred item was collected or paid during that year 
we also use this measure because the collection of our receivables or payment of our obligations has not been a significant issue for our business  but merely a timing issue from one period to the next  with fluctuations generally caused by significant changes in commodity prices or significant changes in drilling activity 
the net change in assets and liabilities relating to operations is also important as it does require or provide additional cash for use in our business  however  we prefer to discuss its effect separately 
for instance  during  we had a million difference between our adjusted cash flow from operations and our gaap cash flow from operations 
the most significant factor was the transfer of approximately million of accrued production receivables relating to our offshore properties that existed as of the closing date to the offshore property purchaser 
this reduction in accrued production receivables during was not considered a collection of receivables for our gaap cash flow from operations 
in addition to the effect of transferred receivables  our other accrued production receivables increased during the year due to the increase in commodity prices  and we reduced our accounts payable and accrued liabilities by approximately million as a result of less overall activity as of year end 
during  we had a million increase to our gaap cash flow from operations resulting from the net change in assets and liabilities relating to operations 
this is primarily due to higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities associated with increased capital spending levels as compared to the prior year 
our accrual for production receivables was higher at the end of than a year earlier  due to higher oil and natural gas prices  partially offsetting the benefit of higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
during  we also had a million increase to our gaap cash flow from operations resulting from the same items as in  namely higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to the higher spending levels  partially offset by an increase in our accrued production receivable as a result of the higher production levels in

if last year s average production is adjusted to include this deferred production  the average production increase between the two years would be reduced to approximately 
of this adjusted annual increase  the january acquisition contributed approximately  boe d of the increase with  boe d attributable to the mississippi non co floods and  boe d to alabama fields  although a small portion of that increase was from our internal development efforts following the acquisition 
production in the mississippi non co floods area declined only modestly during before giving effect to the january acquisition related increase noted above and also during recent drilling activity in the heidelberg selma chalk natural gas has helped offset the gradual declines in oil production during and see co operations above for a discussion of the tertiary related production 
our onshore louisiana production for increased  boe d increase over the prior year s level  due primarily to production increases at thornwell and south chauvin fields as a result of and drilling activity in that area 
we drilled successful wells during  which boosted the production levels in early however  our louisiana production is currently declining  as evidenced by the decline between the third and fourth quarters of  as a result of depletion with insufficient new production to offset it as our success rate was not as good as it had been during since our budget for has been reduced in this area  it is unlikely that our production here will increase during our louisiana properties are generally shorter lived properties than our properties in most other areas  and therefore decline rather rapidly  requiring a consistent increase in new production in order to maintain production levels 
our production in the barnett shale area during increased  boe d increase over our level  also as a result of increased drilling activity  with wells drilled during  as compared to wells drilled during production from this area has increased every quarter during the last two years  with additional modest increases expected during most of as we plan to drill to wells in this area during  although this upward trend will not continue indefinitely 
these wells are characterized by steep decline rates in their first year of production as much as to  followed by a gradual leveling off of production and a resultant slow decline rate  giving them an overall long production life 

table of contents denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as a result of the sale of our offshore properties in july  total production decreased between fiscal year ends and if is adjusted to exclude offshore production  overall production increased approximately on a boe d basis during  anchored by the increased production from our tertiary operations and from our barnett shale play  generally offset by overall declines in production from our onshore conventional properties in mississippi and natural gas wells in louisiana 
our production for was weighted toward oil compared to in and in  and we expect a similar weighting toward oil in due to our increasing emphasis on tertiary operations  unless we make an acquisition that is predominantly natural gas 
oil and natural gas revenues 
our oil and natural gas revenues have increased for each of the last two years  primarily as a result of higher commodity prices  offset in part in by lower production as a result of our sale of offshore properties  but supplemented in by a increase in production levels 
between fiscal year end and  revenues increased by 
the increase in production in  as compared to production in  increased oil and natural gas revenues by million of the total revenue increase and the higher overall commodity prices in on a boe basis further increased revenue by million of the total revenue increase 
between and  revenues increased by 
the overall increase in commodity prices contributed million in additional revenues  of the increase  partially offset by an overall decrease in revenues of million a negative of the total revenue increase related to the lower production volumes 
our net average realized crude oil price has increased each year  averaging higher in over levels and higher in over levels 
our net average realized natural gas price decreased in as compared to levels  but the average price in was higher than during on a weighted average net price per boe  the increases in oil prices have more than offset the less consistent natural gas prices  resulting in a increase in price levels as compared to prices and a increase in prices as compared to levels 
our net revenue is also affected by the difference between our net average price and the nymex quoted price ie  the nymex differential 
during and continuing into and  the discount for our heavier  sour crude which predominantly applies to our eastern mississippi production increased significantly  lowering our overall net price relative to nymex 
our net oil price averaged below nymex during  increased to during  and further increased to during this occurred in spite of our increasing light sweet oil production from our phase i tertiary operations  which should have improved our overall net price as such crude receives near nymex prices and is becoming a higher percentage of our overall production 
however  as evident in and  the oil market is subject to significant and sudden changes and it is difficult to forecast these trends  although our experience indicates that the discount or nymex differential for our heavier sour crude increases as nymex oil prices increase 
our net natural gas prices relative to nymex fluctuate primarily as a result of the trend in the nymex prices during the month 
since most of our natural gas is sold on an index price that is set near the first of each month  the variance will decrease if nymex natural gas prices consistently decrease during the quarter and the opposite is true if prices are increasing 
our natural gas differentials relative to nymex improved in as compared to  primarily due to decreasing natural gas prices throughout most of the year  but the opposite was true during  when prices were generally rising 
during our natural gas price averaged above nymex  during we had an average discount to nymex of  and during we had an average premium of to nymex 
the nymex differential can also vary by area and our natural gas in the barnett shale area has a higher discount to nymex than the natural gas in louisiana 
since our production in the barnett area is growing and expected to increase again during  while our louisiana natural gas is generally declining  if prices remain consistent  we would expect our discount to nymex to gradually increase 
oil and natural gas derivative contracts

operating expenses 
our lease operating expenses have increased each year on both a per boe basis and in absolute dollars primarily as a result of i our increasing emphasis on tertiary operations see discussion of those expenses under co operations above  ii general cost inflation in our industry  iii increased personnel and related costs  iv higher fuel and energy costs to operate our properties  v increasing lease payments for certain of our tertiary operating facilities and equipment  and vi higher workover costs 
the adoption of sfas no 
r effective january  see overview operating results also added approximately million of non cash charges to operating expenses  representing the stock compensation expense pertaining to operating personnel 
during  operating costs averaged per boe  up from per boe in and per boe during operating expenses of our tertiary operations increased from million in to million during and million during  as a result of increased tertiary activity 
tertiary operating expenses were particularly impacted by higher power and energy costs  higher costs for co and payments on leased facilities and equipment see co operations above 
we expect this increase in tertiary operating costs to continue and to further increase our cost per boe as these costs become a more significant portion of our total production and operations 
workover expenses increased by over million during as compared to levels  with over one half of the increase relating to costs incurred on fields acquired during the year to bring them up to our operating standard 
workover expenses were higher in than in primarily due to expenses to repair a mechanical failure on one onshore louisiana well 
production taxes and marketing expenses generally change in proportion to commodity prices and therefore have been higher in each of the last three years along with the increasing commodity prices 
the sale of our offshore properties in also contributed to the increase in production taxes and marketing expenses on a per boe basis during and  as most of our offshore properties were exempt from severance taxes 
general and administrative expenses during the last three years  general and administrative g a expenses have increased on both a gross and per boe basis as outlined below year ended december  amounts in thousands except per boe and employee data gross g a expense state franchise taxes operator labor and overhead recovery charges capitalized exploration expense net g a expense average g a expense per boe employees as of december 
table of contents denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations gross g a expenses increased million  or  between and and million  or  between and the single biggest increase during was due to the adoption of sfas no 
r in january  which increased gross g a expense by approximately million during the year  representing the non cash charge for stock compensation stock options and stock appreciation rights pertaining to personnel charged to g a 
in addition  expenses include approximately million of non cash compensation expense associated with the amortization of deferred compensation resulting from the issuance of restricted stock to officers and directors during which was already being expensed prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
during  we also incurred a million charge to earnings related to the modification of the vesting terms of certain restricted stock and stock options previously granted to our former senior vice president of operations  associated with his departure  and the expensing of approximately  related to the retirement of our vice president of marketing 
g a also increased because of higher compensation costs due to additional employees  associated expenses and wage increases 
during we had a net increase of in our employee count related to our acquisitions and increased activity level and a increase during the prior year 
in addition  due to increased competitive pressures in the industry  our wages are increasing at a rate higher than general inflation and we expect this trend to continue 
as an example  in we granted a mid year pay raise to all employees in order to remain competitive with industry compensation levels 
during  we incurred approximately million to provide food  water  gasoline  and other essential supplies to our employees and charitable organizations in mississippi and louisiana following the hurricanes 
in addition  we have had higher professional service and consultant fees during  primarily related to sarbanes oxley compliance  investigation of hotline reports  and documentation and testing of our new software system that we began using in january  as well as increased maintenance costs as a result of the change to our new software system 
many of these expenses were also applicable in these increases were offset by the absence of approximately million of employee severance payments paid in related to the sale of our offshore properties in july higher operator overhead recovery charges resulting from incremental development activity helped to partially offset the increase in gross g a  partially reduced by the impact of the offshore property sale 
our well operating agreements allow us  when we are the operator  to charge a well with a specified overhead rate during the drilling phase and also to charge a monthly fixed overhead rate for each producing well 
as a result of the additional operated wells from acquisitions  additional tertiary operations  drilling activity during the past year  and increased compensation expense including the allocation of stock compensation to lease operating expense the amount we recovered as operator labor and overhead charges increased by between and and between and capitalized exploration costs increased in as compared to primarily due to increased compensation costs  most of which related to the expensing of stock based compensation associated with the adoption of sfas no 
r 
capitalized exploration costs were relatively unchanged between and as the personnel reductions associated with the sale of our offshore properties in july offset the other increases 
the net effect of the increases in gross g a expenses  operator overhead recoveries and capitalized exploration costs was a increase in net g a expense between and and a increase between and interest and financing expenses year ended december  amounts in thousands except per boe data cash interest expense non cash interest expense less capitalized interest interest expense interest and other income average net cash interest expense per boe average debt outstanding average interest rate cash interest expense less capitalized interest and other income on a boe basis

table of contents denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations interest expense increased in  primarily due to substantially higher average debt levels offset in part by higher interest capitalized on our significant unevaluated properties  primarily related to our acquisitions 
debt levels were unusually low in the first half of following the sale of our offshore properties in mid conversely  debt levels increased in the first quarter of following the million acquisition which closed at the end of january  funded by million of subordinated debt issued in december and million of bank debt borrowed at closing 
the bank debt was repaid in april with the proceeds from an equity sale made that month see overview april equity offering  but an additional million was subsequently borrowed to fund the delhi acquisition in may see overview recent acquisitions and an additional million for general working capital and the payment of the option on hastings field entered into in november  leaving us with total bank debt of million as of december  interest expense for decreased from levels primarily due to capitalized interest of million relating to the construction of our co pipeline to east mississippi and the payoff of our bank debt in the third quarter of with the proceeds from our offshore property sale 
as a result of lower production because of our offshore sale and production deferred as a result of the two hurricanes  interest expense on a per boe basis was not as positive as it was on an absolute basis

we adjust our dd a rate each quarter for significant changes in our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and costs  and thus our dd a rate could change significantly in the future 
our dd a rate increased between fiscal year end and  largely because we did not add many tertiary oil reserves during  which historically have had a lower finding and development cost than our overall company average 
we added approximately mmboe of reserves in the barnett shale during and approximately mmboe in our tertiary oil properties and only minor amounts elsewhere 
further  costs continued to climb in the industry throughout  causing us not only to exceed our cost estimates on our projects  but also to re evaluate and raise our future development costs on our proved undeveloped reserves 
lastly  we did not have any significant discoveries in our exploration program in louisiana  which further contributed to an increase in our dd a rate 
in general  was a transition year for us with regard to our tertiary oil reserves 
prior to  many of our tertiary floods could be considered proven near the start of a project as they were analogous to little creek field an already producing substantial tertiary flood and thus it was not necessary to have a production response to co 

injections before we recognized proved reserves 
conversely  most of our new floods  including two that we started during soso and martinville fields  are not analogous and thus must have an oil production response to the co 

injections before we can recognize tertiary proved oil reserves in these fields  even though we believe there is a similar risk profile in flooding these fields 
due to several delays throughout the year  the soso and martinville floods were completed so late in that there was not a significant production response before year end  a pre condition to booking proved reserves in these fields 

table of contents denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we allocated approximately million of our million january acquisition costs and virtually all of the second quarter million delhi acquisition costs to unevaluated properties to reflect the significant potential reserves that we considered to be part of these acquisitions 
as a result  these acquisitions did not materially affect our overall dd a rate  as the amount included in our full cost pool was a cost per boe relatively consistent with our overall dd a rate 
our dd a rate on a per boe basis increased between and  primarily due to rising costs and increases in capital spending 
during  we spent approximately million on acquisitions  of which approximately million was included in our full cost pool  with the balance becoming part of our unevaluated properties 
due to high commodity prices  our acquisition costs per boe was around per boe  contributing to the higher dd a rate 
in addition  most of our future development cost estimates on our proved undeveloped reserves have been increased to reflect the rising costs in the industry 
our dd a rate for our co

table of contents denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations approximately million of current income taxes as a result of the sale of our offshore properties  which was a gain for income tax purposes 
the taxes on the offshore sale were primarily alternative minimum taxes as we were able to offset the related regular tax with our net operating loss carryforwards that existed at that time 
we no longer have any net operating loss carryforwards 
in all three periods  the current income tax expense represents our anticipated alternative minimum cash taxes that we cannot offset with eor credits 
as of december   we had an estimated million of eor credit carryforwards that we can utilize to reduce a portion of our cash taxes 
these eor credits do not begin to expire until since the ability to earn additional enhanced oil recovery credits is reduced or even eliminated based on the level of oil prices  we do not expect to earn any eor credits during because of the high oil prices during if oil prices remain at current levels or increase further in the future  we will not earn any additional eor credits and once our existing eor credits are utilized  our cash taxes will also increase

table of contents denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations from time to time  we enter into various derivative contracts to provide an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future oil and natural gas production 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
these contracts have consisted of price floors  collars and fixed price swaps 
historically  we hedged up to of our anticipated production each year to provide us with a reasonably certain amount of cash flow to cover most of our budgeted exploration and development expenditures without incurring significant debt 
since and beyond  we have entered into fewer derivative contracts  primarily because of our strong financial position resulting from our lower levels of debt relative to our cash flow from operations 
we did make an exception in late when we swapped to of our forecasted natural gas production at a weighted average price of per mcf 
we did this to protect our projected cash flow primarily because we currently plan to spend million to million more than we expect to generate in cash flow from operations see capital resources and liquidity and we did not want to be exposed to the risk of lower natural gas prices 
these natural gas swaps had increased in value significantly during the short time we held them in see value discussion below  although by february   this positive market value was virtually gone as natural gas prices rebounded during the first part of when we make a significant acquisition  we generally attempt to hedge a large percentage  up to  of the forecasted proved production for the subsequent one to three years following the acquisition in order to help provide us with a minimum return on our investment 
as of december   we had derivative contracts in place related to our million acquisition that closed on january   on which we entered into contracts to cover of the estimated proved producing production at the time we signed the purchase and sale agreement 
while these derivative contracts related to the acquisition represent approximately of our estimated production  they are intended to help protect our acquisition economics related to the first three years of production from the proved producing reserves that we acquired

table of contents denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires that we select certain accounting policies and make certain estimates and judgments regarding the application of those policies 
our significant accounting policies are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the underlying assumptions and judgments by our management in their application  have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
following is a discussion of our most critical accounting estimates  judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in the preparation of our financial statements 
full cost method of accounting  depletion and depreciation and oil and natural gas reserves businesses involved in the production of oil and natural gas are required to follow accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry 
we apply the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties 
another acceptable method of accounting for oil and gas production activities is the successful efforts method of accounting 
in general  the primary differences between the two methods are related to the capitalization of costs and the evaluation for asset impairment 
under the full cost method  all geological and geophysical costs  exploratory dry holes and delay rentals are capitalized to the full cost pool  whereas under the successful efforts method such costs are expensed as incurred 
in the assessment of impairment of oil and gas properties  the successful efforts method follows the guidance of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  under which the net book value of assets are measured for impairment against the undiscounted future cash flows using commodity prices consistent with management expectations 
under the full cost method  the full cost pool net book value of oil and gas properties is measured against future cash flows discounted at using commodity prices in effect at the end of the reporting period 
the financial results for a given period could be substantially different depending on the method of accounting that an oil and gas entity applies 
in our application of full cost accounting for our oil and gas producing activities  we make significant estimates at the end of each period related to accruals for oil and gas revenues  production  capitalized costs and operating expenses 
we calculate these estimates with our best available data  which includes  among other things  production reports  price posting  information compiled from daily drilling reports and other internal tracking devices and analysis of historical results and trends 
while management is not aware of any required revisions to its estimates  there will likely be future adjustments resulting from such things as changes in ownership interests  payouts  joint venture audits  re allocations by the purchaser pipeline  or other corrections and adjustments common in the oil and natural gas industry  many of which will require retroactive application 
these types of adjustments cannot be currently estimated or determined and will be recorded in the period during which the adjustment occurs 
under full cost accounting  the estimated quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves used to compute depletion and the related present value of estimated future net cash flows therefrom used to perform the full cost ceiling test have a significant impact on the underlying financial statements 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is very complex  requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of all available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
the data for a given field may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors  including additional development activity  evolving production history and continued reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
as a result  material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 
although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that the reported reserve estimates represent the most accurate assessments possible  including the hiring of independent engineers to prepare the report  the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various fields make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in our financial statement disclosures 
over the last four years  denbury s annual revisions to its reserve estimates have averaged approximately of the previous year s estimates and have been both positive and negative 
changes in commodity prices also affect our reserve quantities 
during  and  the change to reserve quantities related to commodity prices was relatively small  less than in prior years  as prices were relatively high each year end 
these changes in quantities affect our dd a rate and the combined effect of changes in quantities and commodity prices impacts our full cost ceiling test calculation 
for example  we estimate that a increase in our estimate of proved reserves quantities would have lowered our fourth quarter dd a rate from per bbl to approximately per bbl and a decrease in our proved reserve quantities would have increased our dd a rate to approximately per bbl 
also  reserve quantities and their ultimate values are the primary factors in determining the borrowing base under our bank credit facility and are determined solely by our banks 

table of contents denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations there can also be significant questions as to whether reserves are sufficiently supported by technical evidence to be considered proven 
in some cases our proven reserves are less than what we believe to exist because additional evidence  including production testing  is required in order to classify the reserves as proven 
in other cases  properties such as certain of our potential tertiary recovery projects may not have proven reserves assigned to them primarily because we have not yet completed a specific plan for development or firmly scheduled such development 
we have a corporate policy whereby we generally do not book proved undeveloped reserves unless the project has been committed to internally  which normally means it is scheduled within the next one to two years or at least the commencement of the project is scheduled in the case of longer term multi year projects such as waterfloods and tertiary recovery projects 
therefore  particularly with regard to potential reserves from tertiary recovery our co operations  there is uncertainty as to whether the reserves should be included as proven or not 
we also have a corporate policy whereby proved undeveloped reserves must be economic at long term historical prices  which are usually significantly less than the year end prices used in our reserve report 
this also can have the effect of eliminating certain projects being included in our estimates of proved reserves  which projects would otherwise be included if undeveloped reserves were determined to be economic solely based on current prices in a high price environment  as was the case during the last three year ends 
see depletion  depreciation and amortization under results of operations above for a further discussion 
all of these factors and the decisions made regarding these issues can have a significant effect on our proven reserves and thus on our dd a rate  full cost ceiling test calculation  borrowing base and financial statements 
see also discussion of requirements to book proven tertiary oil reserves at results of operations depletion  depreciation and amortization 
asset retirement obligations we have significant obligations related to the plugging and abandonment of our oil and gas wells  the removal of equipment and facilities from leased acreage  and returning such land to its original condition 
sfas no 
requires that we estimate the future cost of this obligation  discount it to its present value  and record a corresponding asset and liability in our consolidated balance sheets 
the values ultimately derived are based on many significant estimates  including the ultimate expected cost of the obligation  the expected future date of the required cash payment  and interest and inflation rates 
revisions to these estimates may be required based on changes to cost estimates  the timing of settlement  and changes in legal requirements 
any such changes that result in upward or downward revisions in the estimated obligation will result in an adjustment to the related capitalized asset and corresponding liability on a prospective basis and an adjustment in our dd a expense in future periods 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our asset retirement obligations 
accounting for tertiary injection costs we expense at the time of injection our costs associated with the co we use in our tertiary recovery operations 
our costs associated with the co we produce and inject are principally our costs to produce  transport and pay royalties 
there are other acceptable alternatives in accounting for tertiary injectant costs  such as capitalizing these costs as oil and gas properties and depleting them over time  or expensing a portion and deferring a portion of the cost if the injectant material can be recovered and sold at a later time 
our decision to expense our tertiary injectant costs at the time of injection results in greater expense to us at the onset of a new tertiary recovery project as we may inject co for several months before we experience any production response 
also  the injection of co will generally be higher in the earlier portions of the life of the project and will gradually decrease over time 
we expensed costs for the co we injected of million in  million in  and million in income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for financial reporting purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing and recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial reporting purposes 
our federal and state income tax returns are generally not prepared or filed before the consolidated financial statements are prepared  therefore  we estimate the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at the end of each period as well as the effects of tax rate changes  tax credits  and prior to year end  net operating loss carry forwards 
adjustments related to these estimates are recorded in our tax provision in the period in which we file our income tax returns 
further  we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover or utilize our deferred tax assets primarily our 
table of contents denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations enhanced oil recovery credits 
if recovery is not likely  we must record a valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets for the amount we would not expect to recover  which would result in an increase to our income tax expense 
as of december  we believe that all of our deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet will ultimately be recovered 
if our estimates and judgments change regarding our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period it is determined that recovery is not probable 
a increase in our effective tax rate would have increased our calculated income tax expense by approximately million  million  and million for the years ended december   and see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information concerning our income taxes 
oil and gas derivative contracts we enter into derivative contracts to mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk associated with future oil and natural gas production 
these contracts have historically consisted of options  in the form of price floors or collars  and fixed price swaps 
under sfas no 
 every derivative instrument is required to be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at its fair value 
if the derivative does not qualify as a hedge or is not designated as a hedge  the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized currently in earnings 
if the derivative qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting  the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income equity to the extent that the hedge is effective and in the income statement to the extent it is ineffective 
prior to  we applied hedge accounting to our commodity derivative contracts  thereby recording a significant portion of the fair value changes to equity instead of income 
we recognized losses on ineffectiveness on our hedges of million for we measured and computed hedge effectiveness on a quarterly basis 
if a hedging instrument became ineffective  hedge accounting was discontinued and any deferred gains or losses on the cash flow hedge remained in accumulated other comprehensive income until the periods during which the hedges would have otherwise expired 
if we determined it probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will not occur  deferred gains or losses on the hedging instrument were recognized in earnings immediately 
as of january   we abandoned hedge accounting 
this means that any changes in the future fair value of these derivative contracts will be charged to earnings on a quarterly basis instead of charging the effective portion to other comprehensive income and the balance to earnings 
while we may experience more volatility in our net income than if we had continued to apply hedge accounting treatment as permitted by sfas no 
 we believe that for us the benefits associated with applying hedge accounting do not outweigh the cost  time and effort to comply with hedge accounting 
during and  we recognized expense income of million and million  respectively  related to changes in the fair market value of our derivative contracts 
for  if we had not chosen to designate hedge accounting treatment to our oil and natural gas derivative contracts  or if none of our derivative contracts had qualified for hedge accounting treatment  we estimate that our net income would have increased by approximately million 
stock compensation plans effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment using the modified prospective application method described in the statement 
among other items  sfas r eliminates the use of apb and the intrinsic value method of accounting  and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  based on the grant date fair value of those awards  in the financial statements 
under the modified prospective application method  effective january   we began to recognize compensation expense for the unvested portion of awards outstanding as of december   over the remaining service periods  and for new awards granted or modified after january  we estimate the fair value of stock option or stock appreciation right sar awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option valuation model requires the input of somewhat subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility and expected term 
other assumptions required for estimating fair value with the black scholes model are the expected risk free interest rate and expected dividend yield of the company s stock 
the risk free interest rates used are the us treasury yield for bonds 
table of contents denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations matching the expected term of the option on the date of grant 
our dividend yield is zero  as denbury does not pay a dividend 
we utilize historical experience in arriving at our assumptions for volatility and expected term inputs 
we recognize the stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
the expense we recognize is net of estimated forfeitures 
we estimate our forfeiture rate based on prior experience and true it up for actual results as the awards vest 
as of december   there was million of total compensation cost to be recognized in future periods related to non vested stock options and sars 
the cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make other estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses during each reporting period 
we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and reliable and believe that the ultimate actual results will not differ significantly from those reported  however  such estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and such risks and uncertainties could cause the actual results to differ materially from our estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin requires recognition of the impact of a tax position in the company s financial statements if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the provisions of fin are effective as of the beginning of the company s fiscal year  with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
we are still evaluating the potential impact of this interpretation on the company s financial statements
