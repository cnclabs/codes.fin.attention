item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements 
we depend heavily on our principal customers our ability to maintain close  mutually beneficial relationships with our two largest customers  whole foods market and wild oats markets  is an important element to our continued growth 
in october  we announced a seven year distribution agreement with whole foods market  which commenced on september   under which we will continue to serve as the primary us distributor to whole foods market in the regions where we previously served 
in january  we expanded our whole foods market relationship in the southern pacific region of the united states 
whole foods market accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal in january  we entered into a five year primary distribution agreement with wild oats markets 
we had previously served as primary distributor for wild oats markets through august wild oats markets accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal as a result of this concentration of our customer base  the loss or cancellation of business from either of these customers  including from increased distribution to their own facilities or the merger of these companies  could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
as discussed above under business overview  whole foods market and wild oats markets announced on february  that the two companies had entered into a merger agreement 
this merger was substantially completed in august and wild oats markets became a subsidiary of whole foods market 
wild oats markets is expected to become a wholly owned subsidiary of whole foods market in the near future 
on a combined basis  whole foods market and wild oats markets accounted for approximately or our net sales in fiscal whole foods market has announced that it will be selling all thirty five of wild oats markets henry s and sun harvest store locations to a subsidiary of smart final inc following the closing of its merger with wild oats markets 
sales to henry s and sun harvest stores comprised approximately of our business with wild oats markets in fiscal excluding our sales to henry s and sun harvest stores  sales to whole foods market and wild oats markets accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal at this time  we cannot accurately estimate the impact  if any  that the merger of whole foods market and wild oats markets will have on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we sell products under purchase orders  and we generally have no agreements with or commitments from our customers for the purchase of products 
we cannot assure you that our customers will maintain or increase their sales volumes or orders for the products supplied by us or that we will be able to maintain or add to our existing customer base 
our profit margins may decrease due to consolidation in the grocery industry the grocery distribution industry generally is characterized by relatively high volume with relatively low profit margins 
the continuing consolidation of retailers in the natural products industry and the growth of supernatural chains may reduce our profit margins in the future as more customers qualify for greater volume discounts  and we experience pricing pressures from both ends of the supply chain 
our acquisitive nature may adversely affect our business we continually evaluate opportunities to acquire other companies 
we believe that there are risks related to acquiring companies  including overpaying for acquisitions  losing key employees of acquired companies and failing to achieve potential synergies 
additionally  our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to integrate our acquisitions and mergers 
a significant portion of our historical growth has been achieved through acquisitions of or mergers with other distributors of natural products 
successful integration of mergers is critical to our future operating and financial performance 
integration requires  among other things maintaining the customer base  optimizing of delivery routes  coordinating administrative  distribution and finance functions  and integrating management information systems and personnel 
the integration process has and could divert the attention of management and any difficulties or problems encountered in the transition process could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  the process of combining companies has and could cause the interruption of  or a loss of momentum in  the activities of the respective businesses  which could have an adverse effect on their combined operations 
we cannot assure you that we will realize any of the anticipated benefits of mergers 
we may have difficulty in managing our growth the growth in the size of our business and operations has placed and is expected to continue to place a significant strain on our management 
our future growth is limited in part by the size and location of our distribution centers 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully expand our existing distribution facilities or open new distribution facilities in new or existing markets to facilitate growth 
in addition  our growth strategy to expand our market presence includes possible additional acquisitions 
to the extent our future growth includes acquisitions  we cannot assure you that we will successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates  consummate and integrate such potential acquisitions or expand into new markets 
our ability to compete effectively and to manage future growth  if any  will depend on our ability to continue to implement and improve operational  financial and management information systems on a timely basis and to expand  train  motivate and manage our work force 
we cannot assure you that our personnel  systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to support our operations 
our inability to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our focus on growth may temporarily redirect resources previously focused on reducing product cost  resulting in lower gross profits in relation to sales 
we have significant competition from a variety of sources we operate in competitive markets  and our future success will be largely dependent on our ability to provide quality products and services at competitive prices 
our competition comes from a variety of sources  including other distributors of natural products as well as specialty grocery and mass market grocery distributors 
we cannot assure you that mass market grocery distributors will not increase their emphasis on natural products and more directly compete with us or that new competitors will not enter the market 
these distributors may have been in business longer than we have  may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and may be better established in their markets 
we cannot assure you that our current or potential competitors will not provide services comparable or superior to those provided by us or adapt more quickly than we do to evolving industry trends or changing market requirements 
it is also possible that alliances among competitors may develop and rapidly acquire significant market share or that certain of our customers will increase distribution to their own retail facilities 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors 
our operations are sensitive to economic downturns the grocery industry is also sensitive to national and regional economic conditions and the demand for our products may be adversely affected from time to time by economic downturns 
in addition  our operating results are particularly sensitive to  and may be materially adversely affected by difficulties with the collectibility of accounts receivable  difficulties with inventory control  competitive pricing pressures  and unexpected increases in fuel or other transportation related costs 
we cannot assure you that one or more of such factors will not materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
increased fuel costs may adversely affect our results of operations increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on our results of operations 
the high cost of diesel fuel can also increase the price we pay for products as well as the costs we incur to deliver products to our customers 
these factors  in turn  may negatively impact our net sales  margins  operating expenses and operating results 
to manage this risk  we may periodically enter into heating oil derivative contracts to hedge a portion of our projected diesel fuel requirements 
heating crude oil prices have a highly correlated relationship to fuel prices  making these derivatives effective in offsetting changes in the cost of diesel fuel 
we do not enter into fuel hedge contracts for speculative purposes 
our operating results are subject to significant fluctuations our net sales and operating results may vary significantly from period to period due to demand for natural products  changes in our operating expenses  including fuel and insurance  management s ability to execute our business and growth strategies  changes in customer preferences and demands for natural products  including levels of enthusiasm for health  fitness and environmental issues  fluctuation of natural product prices due to competitive pressures  personnel changes  supply shortages  general economic conditions  lack of an adequate supply of high quality agricultural products due to poor growing conditions  natural disasters or otherwise  volatility in prices of high quality agricultural products resulting from poor growing conditions  natural disasters or otherwise  and future acquisitions  particularly in periods immediately following the consummation of such acquisition transactions while the operations of the acquired businesses are being integrated into our operations 
due to the foregoing factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be meaningful and that such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
access to capital and the cost of that capital we have an amended and restated secured revolving credit facility  with available credit under it of million at an interest rate of libor plus maturing on march  as of july   our borrowing base  based on accounts receivable and inventory levels  was million  with remaining availability of million 
we are currently investigating options for renewing or negotiating our amended and restated credit facility in fiscal  but cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so on terms acceptable to us 
in april  we executed a term loan agreement in the principal amount of million secured by the real property that was released in accordance with an amendment to the loan and security agreement related to the amended and restated credit facility 
the million term loan was repayable over seven years based on a fifteen year amortization schedule 
interest on the term loan accrues at libor plus 
in december  we amended this term loan agreement by increasing the principal amount from million to million under the existing terms and conditions 
in july  we amended the term loan agreement  which further increased the principal amount from million to a maximum of up to million 
the amended term loan accrues interest at libor plus  and is repayable over seven years based on a fifteen year amortization schedule  with all other terms and conditions remaining unchanged 
as of july   million was outstanding under the term loan agreement 
in order to maintain our profit margins  we rely on strategic investment buying initiatives  such as discounted bulk purchases  which require spending significant amounts of working capital 
in the event that our cost of capital increases or our ability to borrow funds or raise equity capital is limited  we could suffer reduced profit margins and be unable to grow our business organically or through acquisitions  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we are subject to significant governmental regulation our business is highly regulated at the federal  state and local levels and our products and distribution operations require various licenses  permits and approvals 
in particular our products are subject to inspection by the us food and drug administration  our warehouse and distribution facilities are subject to inspection by the us department of agriculture and state health authorities  and the us department of transportation and the us federal highway administration regulate our trucking operations 
the loss or revocation of any existing licenses  permits or approvals or the failure to obtain any additional licenses  permits or approvals in new jurisdictions where we intend to do business could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we are dependent on a number of key executives management of our business is substantially dependent upon the services of richard antonelli executive vice president  chief operating officer and president of distribution  daniel v

shamber vice president  chief financial officer and treasurer  and other key management employees 
loss of the services of any officers or any other key management employee could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
union organizing activities could cause labor relations difficulties as of july   we had approximately  full and part time employees 
an aggregate of approximately of our total employees  or approximately of the employees at our auburn  washington  iowa city  iowa and edison  new jersey facilities  are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
the edison  new jersey  auburn  washington  and iowa city  iowa agreements expire in june  february and july  respectively 
we have in the past been the focus of union organizing efforts 
as we increase our employee base and broaden our distribution operations to new geographic markets  our increased visibility could result in increased or expanded union organizing efforts 
although we have not experienced a work stoppage to date  if additional employees were to unionize or we are not successful in reaching agreement with these employees  we could be subject to work stoppages and increases in labor costs  either of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations

overview we are a leading national distributor of natural and organic foods and related products in the united states 
in recent years  our sales to existing and new customers have increased through the continued growth of the natural and organic products industry in general  increased market share as a result of our high quality service and our increasingly broader product selection  and the acquisition of  or merger with  natural products distributors  the expansion of our existing distribution centers  the construction of new distribution centers and the development of our own line of natural and organic branded products 
through these efforts  we believe that we have been able to broaden our geographic penetration  expand our customer base  enhance and diversify our product selections and increase our market share 
we also own and operate retail natural products stores  located primarily in florida  through our subsidiary  nrg 
we believe that our retail business serves as a natural complement to our distribution business because it enables us to develop new marketing programs and improve customer service 
in addition  our subsidiary  hershey imports  specializes in the international importing  roasting and packaging of nuts  seeds  dried fruits and snack items 
our operations are comprised of three principal divisions our wholesale division  which includes our broadline distribution business  albert s and select nutrition  our retail division  which consists of our retail stores  and our manufacturing division  which is comprised of hershey imports and our branded product lines 
in order to maintain our market leadership and improve our operating efficiencies  we seek to continually expand our marketing and customer service programs across regions  expand our national purchasing opportunities  offer a broader product selection  consolidate systems applications among physical locations and regions  increase our investment in people  facilities  equipment and technology  integrate administrative and accounting functions  and reduce geographic overlap between regions 
our continued growth has created the need for expansion of existing facilities to achieve maximum operating efficiencies and to assure adequate space for future needs 
in february  we announced plans to construct a new  square foot distribution center in ridgefield  washington  to serve as a regional distribution hub for customers in portland  oregon and other northwest states 
the distribution center is scheduled to commence operations in the second quarter of fiscal in march  we entered into a lease agreement to rent warehouse space in central florida 
the warehouse in central florida is expected to open in the first quarter of fiscal this will reduce the geographic area served by the atlanta  georgia facility and is expected to contribute to lower transportation costs 
we have made significant capital expenditures and incurred considerable expenses in connection with the opening and expansion of our facilities 
in october  we opened our rocklin  california distribution center and moved our auburn  california operations to this facility 
the rocklin distribution center is  square feet and serves as a distribution hub for customers in northern california and surrounding states 
the rocklin distribution center is the largest facility in our nationwide distribution network 
in august  we expanded our midwest operations by opening a  square foot distribution center in greenwood  indiana  which serves as a distribution hub for our customers in illinois  indiana  ohio and other midwest states 
we expect the efficiencies created by opening the greenwood facility and by relocating from two facilities in auburn  california into the rocklin distribution center to continue to lower operating expenses relative to sales over the long term 
including the opening of the greenwood and rocklin facilities  we have added approximately  square feet to our distribution centers since fiscal  representing a increase in our distribution capacity 
our current capacity utilization is approximately 
our net sales consist primarily of sales of natural and organic products to retailers adjusted for customer volume discounts  returns and allowances 
net sales also consist of amounts due to us from customers for shipping and handling and fuel surcharges 
the principal components of our cost of sales include the amounts paid to manufacturers and growers for product sold  plus the cost of transportation necessary to bring the product to our distribution facilities 
cost of sales also includes amounts incurred by us for inbound transportation costs  depreciation for manufacturing equipment at our manufacturing subsidiary  hershey imports  and consideration received from suppliers in connection with the purchase or promotion of the suppliers products 
our gross margin may not be comparable to other similar companies within our industry that may include all costs related to their distribution network in their costs of sales rather than as operating expenses 
we include purchasing and outbound transportation expenses within our operating expenses rather than in our cost of sales 
total operating expenses include salaries and wages  employee benefits including payments under our employee stock ownership plan  warehousing and delivery  selling  occupancy  insurance  administrative  depreciation and amortization expense 
other expenses income include interest on our outstanding indebtedness  interest income and miscellaneous income and expenses 
on february   whole foods market and wild oats markets announced that the two companies had entered into an agreement and plan of merger under which whole foods market would commence an offer to purchase all the outstanding shares of wild oats markets and following the tender offer  wild oats markets would merge with and into a subsidiary of whole foods market 
this merger was substantially completed in august and wild oats markets became a subsidiary of whole foods market 
wild oats markets is expected to become a wholly owned subsidiary of whole foods market in the near future 
as discussed below  sales to wild oats markets accounted for approximately and of our net sales for the years ended july  and july   respectively 
sales to whole foods market accounted for approximately and of our net sales for the years ended july  and july   respectively 
at this time  we cannot accurately estimate the impact  if any  that this merger will have on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the securities and exchange commission has defined critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require our most difficult  complex or subjective judgments or estimates 
based on this definition  we believe our critical accounting policies include the following i determining our allowance for doubtful accounts  ii determining our reserves for the self insured portions of our workers compensation and automobile liabilities and iii valuing goodwill and intangible assets 
for all financial statement periods presented  there have been no material modifications to the application of these critical accounting policies 
allowance for doubtful accounts we analyze customer creditworthiness  accounts receivable balances  payment history  payment terms and historical bad debt levels when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
in instances where a reserve has been recorded for a particular customer  future sales to the customer are conducted using either cash on delivery terms  or the account is closely monitored so that as agreed upon payments are received  orders are released  a failure to pay results in held or cancelled orders 
our accounts receivable balance was million and million  net of the allowance for doubtful accounts of million and million  as of july  and july   respectively 
our notes receivable balances were million and million  net of the allowance of doubtful accounts of million and million  as of july  and july   respectively 
insurance reserves it is our policy to record the self insured portions of our workers compensation and automobile liabilities based upon actuarial methods of estimating the future cost of claims and related expenses that have been reported but not settled  and that have been incurred but not yet reported 
any projection of losses concerning workers compensation and automobile liability is subject to a considerable degree of variability 
among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting litigation trends  benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns 
if actual claims incurred are greater than those anticipated  our reserves may be insufficient and additional costs could be recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that companies test goodwill for impairment at least annually and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
we have elected to perform our annual tests for indications of goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of each year 
impairment losses are determined based upon the excess of carrying amounts over discounted expected future cash flows of the underlying business 
the assessment of the recoverability of long lived assets will be impacted if estimated future cash flows are not achieved 
for reporting units that indicated potential impairment  we determined the implied fair value of that reporting unit using a discounted cash flow analysis and compared such values to the respective reporting units carrying amounts 
as of july   our annual assessment of each of our reporting units indicated that no impairment of goodwill existed 
total goodwill as of july  and july  was million and million  respectively 
results of operations the following table presents  for the periods indicated  certain income and expense items expressed as a percentage of net sales year ended july  july  july  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses impairment on assets held for sale restructuring and asset impairment charges total operating expenses operating income other expense income interest expense interest income other  net total other expense income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income total reflects rounding year ended july  compared to year ended july  net sales our net sales increased approximately  or million  to billion for the year ended july   from billion for the year ended july  this increase was primarily due to organic growth growth excluding the impact of acquisitions in our wholesale distribution segment of million or 
our organic growth is due to the continued growth of the natural products industry in general  increased market share as a result of our focus on service and added value services  the opening of new  and expansion of existing  distribution centers  which allow us to carry a broader selection of products  and approximately sales growth as a result of our expanded relationship with whole foods market in the southern pacific region of the united states 
in addition to our organic growth  we also benefited from the inclusion of sales related to our acquisition of organic brands llc organic brands in april and our acquisitions of other branded product lines  however  these acquisitions impacted our cost of sales and gross profit more than they impacted our net sales 
in the year ended july   whole foods market comprised approximately of net sales and wild oats markets comprised approximately of net sales 
in the year ended july   whole foods market comprised approximately of net sales and wild oats markets comprised approximately of net sales 
the following table lists the percentage of sales by customer type for the years ended july  and july  customer type percentage of net sales independently owned natural products retailers supernatural chains conventional supermarkets other sales by channel have been adjusted to properly reflect changes in customer types resulting from a review of our customer lists 
as a result of this adjustment  sales to the independents sales channel decreased for the year ended july  and sales to the supermarket sales channel increased for the year ended july  gross profit our gross profit increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july   from million for the year ended july  our gross profit as a percentage of net sales was for the year ended july  and for the year ended july  the decline in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was driven by missed forward buying opportunities of approximately million due to our focus on our expanded whole foods market relationship in the southern pacific region of the united states  which we commenced in january  the full year effect of new customer agreements  million of spoilage issues related to certain inventory at our albert s organics division  and million of incremental inventory adjustments within our broadline distribution business  partially offset by increases in rates within our fuel surcharge program  which passes to our customers the increased fuel costs associated with distributing our products to customers 
our intention is to increase our branded product revenues  which we believe will allow us to generate higher gross margins over the long term  as branded product revenues generally yield higher margins 
operating expenses our total operating expenses increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july   from million for the year ended july  the increase in total operating expenses for the year ended july  was due to increases in infrastructure and personnel costs within our wholesale division of million to support our continued sales growth  a million increase in fuel costs  increased health insurance expenses of approximately million  increased depreciation expense of approximately million  a loss of million related to the sale of one of our auburn  california facilities  million of incremental and redundant costs incurred in connection with the start up of our sarasota  florida facility  and million of costs to transition the expanded relationship with whole foods market in the southern pacific region of the united states to our facility located in fontana  california  all recorded during the year ended july  these increases were partially offset by reductions of million in bad debt expense 
total operating expenses for the year ended july  included million of expenses incurred in connection with the employment transition agreement entered into during the first quarter of fiscal with our former president and chief executive officer  not including the effect of share based compensation discussed below  and million of incremental and redundant costs incurred in connection with the transition from our former warehouses and outside storage facility in auburn  california into our new facility in rocklin  california

as a percentage of net sales  total operating expenses decreased to approximately for the year ended july   from approximately for the year ended july  the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to further leveraging our fixed operating costs due to our increased sales  improved operations in our select nutrition division and increased efficiencies due to our recent distribution facility openings  offset by operating losses related to the albert s organics greenwood  indiana location which operations were transferred to the albert s organics minneapolis  minnesota facility effective october  
we expect these efficiencies to continue to lower operating expenses relative to sales over the long term

recently issued financial accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin prescribes detailed guidance for the financial statement recognition  measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized upon the adoption of fin and in subsequent periods 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and the provisions of fin will be applied to all tax positions upon initial adoption of the interpretation 
the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of this interpretation will be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for that fiscal year 
we will adopt fin in fiscal we do not believe that the adoption of fin will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements under other accounting pronouncements  but does not change the existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we will adopt sfas in fiscal and currently are evaluating whether the adoption of sfas will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we will adopt sfas in fiscal and currently are evaluating whether the adoption of sfas will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations on our borrowings 
as more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we use interest rate swap agreements to modify variable rate obligations to fixed rate obligations 
we began managing portions of our debt portfolio by using interest rate swaps to achieve a desired mix of fixed rates in at july   we had one interest rate swap relating to our million term loan agreement 
we account for our interest rate swap agreement entered into during august swap using hedge accounting treatment because the derivative has been determined to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value of the hedged items 
the agreement provides for us to pay interest for a seven year period at a fixed rate of on an amortizing notional principal amount of million while receiving interest for the same period at one month libor on the same amortizing notional principal amount 
the swap has been entered into as a hedge against libor movements on current variable rate indebtedness totaling million at libor plus  thereby fixing our effective rate on the notional amount at 
under this method of accounting  at july   we had recorded an asset of million representing the fair value of the swap 
we do not enter into derivative agreements for trading purposes 
at july   we had long term floating rate debt of million and long term fixed rate debt of million  representing and  respectively  of our long term debt 
at july   we had long term floating rate debt of million and long term fixed rate debt of million  representing and  respectively  of our long term debt 
holding other swap terms and debt levels constant  a basis point change in interest rates would change the unrealized fair market value of the fixed rate debt by approximately  and  at july  and july   respectively 
at july  and july   the after tax earnings and cash flows impact resulting from a basis point increase in interest rates would be approximately  and  respectively  holding other variables constant
