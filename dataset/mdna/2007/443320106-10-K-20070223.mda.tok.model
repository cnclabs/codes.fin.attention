minimum annual rental commitments  at december   under non cancelable operating leases  principally for real estate  containers and equipment and the earn out relted to comtrak are payable as follows in thousands and thereafter deferred compensation under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan the plan  participants can elect to defer certain compensation 
payments under the plan are due as follows in thousands and thereafter critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
in certain circumstances  those estimates and assumptions can affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and estimates 
allowance for uncollectible trade accounts receivable in the normal course of business  we extend credit to customers after a review of each customer s credit history 
an allowance for uncollectible trade accounts has been established through an analysis of the accounts receivable aging  an assessment of collectibility based on historical trends and an evaluation of the current economic conditions 
to be more specific  we reserve a portion of every account balance that has aged over one year  a portion of certain customers in bankruptcy and account balances specifically identified as uncollectible 
the allowance is reported on the balance sheet in net accounts receivable 
actual collections of accounts receivable could differ from management s estimates due to changes in future economic  industry or customer financial conditions 
recoveries of receivables previously charged off are recorded when received 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized at the time persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in accordance with eitf  revenue and related transportation costs are recognized based on relative transit time 
further  we report revenue on a gross basis in accordance with the criteria in eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
we are the primary obligor and are responsible for providing the service desired by the customer 
the customer views us as responsible for fulfillment including the acceptability of the service 
service requirements may include  for example  on time delivery  handling freight loss and damage claims  setting up appointments for pick up and delivery and tracing shipments in transit 
we have discretion in setting sales prices and as a result  our earnings vary 
in addition  we have the discretion to select our vendors from multiple suppliers for the services ordered by our customers 
finally  we have credit risk for our receivables 
these three factors  discretion in setting prices  discretion in selecting vendors and credit risk  further support reporting revenue on the gross basis 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized with the exception of  related to state tax net operating losses and other state credits for which valuation allowances have been established 
in the event the probability of realizing the remaining deferred tax assets do not meet the more likely than not threshold in the future  a valuation allowance would be established for the deferred tax assets deemed unrecoverable 
valuation of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles we review goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill or other indefinite lived intangibles may not be recoverable 
we utilize a third party independent valuation firm to assist in performing the necessary valuations to be used in the impairment testing 
these valuations are based on market capitalization  discounted cash flow analysis or a combination of both methodologies 
the assumptions used in the valuations include expectations regarding future operating performance  discount rates  control premiums and other factors which are subjective in nature 
actual cash flows from operations could differ from management s estimates due to changes in business conditions  operating performance and economic conditions 
should estimates differ materially from actual results  we may be required to record impairment charges in the future 
equipment we operate tractors and utilize containers in connection with our business 
this equipment may be purchased or acquired under capital or operating lease agreements 
in addition  we rent equipment from third parties and various railroads under short term rental arrangements 
equipment which is purchased is depreciated on the straight line method over the estimated useful life 
we had no equipment under capital lease arrangements at december  our equipment leases have five to seven year terms and in some cases contain renewal options 
stock based compensation effective january  we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of fasb statement no 
r share based payment sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective transition method 
prior to january   we accounted for our share based compensation plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations as permitted by statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
we have not granted any stock options since instead  we have issued restricted stock that vests over three to five years 
in addition  during  the board of directors granted performance units which entitle the recipients to receive restricted stock contingent upon the achievement of an operating income earnings target 
as of december   there was million of unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested shared based compensation that is expected be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
in addition  we have performance units that were issued in may of the unrecognized compensation cost mentioned above does not include any potential unrecognized compensation expense associated with the performance units 
new pronouncement in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which is an interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
in addition  fin clearly scopes out income taxes from financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for contingencies 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will implement this interpretation effective january  the company has completed its initial evaluation of the impact of the january  adoption of fin and determined that such adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position 
outlook  risks and uncertainties business combinations divestitures we believe that future acquisitions that we make could significantly impact financial results 
financial results most likely to be impacted include  but are not limited to  revenue  gross margin  salaries and benefits  selling general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization  interest expense  net income and our debt level 
revenue we believe that the performance of the railroads and a severe or prolonged slow down of the economy are the most significant factors that could negatively influence our revenue growth rate 
should there be further consolidation in the rail industry causing a service disruption  we believe our intermodal business would likely be negatively impacted 
should there be a significant service disruption  we expect that there may be some customers who would switch from using our intermodal service to other transportation services 
we expect that these customers may choose to continue to utilize other services even when intermodal service levels are restored 
other factors that could negatively influence our growth rate include  but are not limited to  the elimination of fuel surcharges  the entry of new web based competitors  customer retention  inadequate drayage service and inadequate equipment supply 
gross margin we expect fluctuations in gross margin as a percentage of revenue from quarter to quarter caused by various factors including  but not limited to  changes in the core transportation business mix  trailer and container capacity  vendor pricing  fuel costs  intermodal industry growth  intermodal industry service levels  accessorials  competition and accounting estimates 
salaries and benefits we estimate that salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue could fluctuate from quarter to quarter as there are timing differences between volume increases and changes in levels of staffing 
factors that could affect the percentage from staying in the recent historical range include  but are not limited to  revenue growth rates significantly higher or lower than forecasted  a management decision to invest in additional personnel to stimulate new or existing businesses  changes in customer requirements  changes in our operating structure and changes in railroad intermodal service levels which could result in a lower or higher cost of labor per move 
general and administrative we believe there are several factors that could cause general and administrative expenses to fluctuate as a percentage of revenue 
as customer expectations and the competitive environment require the development of web based business interfaces and the restructuring of our information systems and related platforms  we believe there could be significant expenses incurred  some of which would not be capitalized 
other factors that could cause selling  general and administrative expense to fluctuate include  but are not limited to  changes in insurance premiums and outside services expense 
depreciation and amortization we estimate that depreciation and amortization of property and equipment will decrease slightly in impairment of property and equipment  goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles on an ongoing basis  we assess the realizability of our assets 
if  at any point during the year  management determines that an impairment exists  the carrying amount of the asset is reduced by the estimated impairment with a corresponding charge to earnings 
if it is determined that an impairment exists  management estimates that the write down of specific assets could have a material adverse impact on earnings 
other income expense factors that could cause a change in interest income include  but are not limited to  funding working capital needs  funding capital expenditures  funding an acquisition and buying back stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates on our bank line of credit which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we seek to minimize the risk from interest rate volatility through our regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
no derivative financial instruments are outstanding at december  we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes 
at december   the company had no outstanding obligations under its bank line of credit arrangement
