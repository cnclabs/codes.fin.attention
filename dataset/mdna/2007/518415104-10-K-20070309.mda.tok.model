item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
operations we do not manufacture our own silicon wafers 
we maintain strategic relationships with large semiconductor foundries to source our finished silicon wafers 
this strategy allows us to focus our internal resources on product and market development  and eliminates the fixed cost of owning and operating semiconductor manufacturing facilities 
we are also able to take advantage of the ongoing advanced process technology development efforts of semiconductor foundries 
in addition  all of our assembly operations and most of our test operations are performed by outside suppliers 
we perform certain test operations and reliability and quality assurance processes internally 
we have achieved and maintained iso quality certification since  which is an indication of our high internal operational standards 
in  we achieved iso ts quality systems certification  and released a full line of pld products qualified to the aec q reliability standard 
wafer fabrication we source silicon wafers from our foundry partners  fujitsu in japan  seiko epson in japan  united microelectronics corporation umc in taiwan and chartered semiconductor manufacturing  ltd 
chartered semiconductor in singapore  pursuant to agreements with each company and their respective affiliates 
we negotiate wafer volumes  prices and other terms with our foundry partners and their respective affiliates on a periodic basis 
assembly after wafer fabrication and initial testing  we ship wafers to independent subcontractors for assembly 
during assembly  wafers are separated into individual die and encapsulated in plastic or ceramic packages 
presently  we have qualified assembly partners in china  indonesia  japan  malaysia  the philippines and south korea 
we negotiate assembly prices  volumes and other terms with our assembly partners and their respective affiliates on a periodic basis 
we currently offer an extensive list of standard products in lead pb free packaging 
our lead free products meet the european parliament directive entitled restrictions on the use of hazardous substances 
we continually review our suppliers to ensure they meet or exceed our packaging requirements 
testing we electrically test the die on each wafer prior to shipment for assembly 
following assembly  prior to customer shipment  each product undergoes final testing and quality assurance procedures 
final testing on certain products is performed by independent contractors in china  indonesia  japan  malaysia  the philippines and south korea  and at our oregon facility 
marketing  sales and customers we sell our products directly to end customers through a network of independent manufacturers representatives and indirectly through a network of independent distributors 
we also employ a direct sales management and field applications engineering organization to support our end customers and indirect sales resources 
our end customers are primarily original equipment manufacturers in the communications  computing  consumer  industrial  automotive  medical and military end markets 
as of december  we have agreements with manufacturers representatives and two primary distributors  arrow electronics  inc and avnet inc  in north america 
we have also established export sales channels in over foreign countries through a network of over sales representatives and distributors 
the majority of our sales are made through distributors 
we protect both of our primary north american distributors and some of our foreign distributors against reductions in published prices  and expect to continue this policy in the foreseeable future 
we also allow returns from these distributors of unsold products under certain conditions 
for these reasons  we do not recognize revenue until products are resold by these distributors to an end customer 
we provide technical and marketing support to our end customers with engineering staff based at our headquarters  product development centers and selected field sales offices 
we maintain numerous domestic and international field sales offices in major metropolitan areas 
export sales as a percentage of our total revenue were in fiscal  in and in export sales to china were of revenue in fiscal and in both and  while export sales to japan were of revenue in fiscal  of revenue in and of revenue in in addition  export sales to taiwan were of revenue in fiscal  eight percent in and nine percent in both export and domestic sales are denominated in us dollars  with the exception of sales to japan  which are denominated in yen 
if our export sales decline significantly  there would be a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 
our products are sold to a large and diverse group of customers 
no individual end customer accounted for more than of total revenue in any of fiscal years  or seasonality in most years  we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products 
sales of our products are often stronger in the first half of the year  and often weaker in the summer months 
in addition  december is often a weak month for sales 
however  on balance  general economic and semiconductor market conditions have a greater impact on our business and financial results than seasonal trends 
backlog our backlog of scheduled and released orders at december  was million  as compared to million at december  this backlog consisted of direct customer and distributor orders scheduled for delivery within the next days 
distributor orders accounted for the majority of the backlog in both periods 
direct customer orders may be changed  rescheduled or cancelled under certain circumstances without penalty prior to shipment 
additionally  distributor orders generally may be changed  rescheduled or cancelled without penalty prior to shipment 
furthermore  certain of our distributor shipments are subject to rights of return and price adjustment 
revenue associated with these distributor shipments is not recognized until the product is resold to an end customer 
typically  the majority of our revenue results from orders placed and filled within the same period 
such orders are referred to as turns orders 
by definition  turns orders are not captured in a backlog measurement made at the beginning of a period 
we do not anticipate a significant change in this business pattern 
for these reasons  backlog as of any particular date should not be used as a predictor of revenue for any future period 
competition the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid rates of technological change  product obsolescence and price erosion 
our current and potential competitors include a broad range of semiconductor companies from emerging companies to large  established companies  many of which have greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing and sales resources than we do 
the principal competitive factors in the programmable logic market include silicon and software product features  price  technical support  and sales  marketing and distribution strength 
the availability of competitive intellectual property cores is also critical 
in addition to product features such as density  performance  power consumption  reprogrammability  and reliability  competition occurs on the basis of price and market acceptance of specific products and technology 
we intend to continue to address these competitive factors by working to continually introduce product enhancements and new products and by working to reduce the manufacturing cost of our products 
we compete directly with actel corporation  altera corporation and xilinx  inc we also indirectly compete with other semiconductor companies that provide logic solutions that are not user programmable 
although to date we have not experienced direct competition from companies located outside the united states  such companies may become a more significant competitive factor in the future 
competition may also increase if other larger semiconductor companies seek to expand into our market 
any such increases in competition could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
patents we seek to protect our products and technologies primarily through patents  trade secrecy measures  copyrights  mask work protection  trademark registrations  licensing restrictions  confidentiality agreements and other approaches designed to protect proprietary information 
there can be no assurance that others may not independently develop competitive technology not covered by our intellectual property rights or that measures we take to protect our technology will be effective 
we hold numerous domestic  european and asian patents and have patent applications pending in the united states  asia and europe 
our current patents will expire at various times between and there can be no assurance that pending patent applications or other applications that may be filed will result in issued patents  or that any issued patents will survive challenges to their validity 
although we believe that our patents have value  there can be no assurance that our patents  or any additional patents that may be issued in the future  will provide meaningful protection from competition 
we believe that our success will depend primarily upon the technical expertise  experience  creativity and the sales and marketing abilities of our personnel 
patent and other proprietary rights infringement claims are common in our industry 
there can be no assurance that  with respect to any claim made against us  we could obtain a license on terms or under conditions that would not harm our business 
licenses and agreements advanced micro devices in  as part of our acquisition of vantis corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of advanced micro devices  inc amd  we entered into an agreement with amd pursuant to which we have cross licensed vantis patents with amd patents  having an effective filing date on or before june   related to programmable logic products 
this cross license was made on a worldwide  non exclusive and royalty free basis 
additionally  as part of our acquisition of vantis  we acquired certain third party license rights held by vantis prior to the acquisition  including rights to use certain xilinx patents to manufacture  market and sell products 
agere systems in  as part of our acquisition of the fpga business of agere  we entered into an intellectual property agreement with agere and agere systems guardian corporation 
pursuant to this agreement  these agere companies assigned or licensed to us certain fpga and field programmable system chip patents  trademarks  software and other intellectual property rights and technology  and we licensed back rights in these same assets 
these cross licenses were made on a worldwide and royalty free basis 
altera in  we entered into a comprehensive  royalty free patent cross license agreement and a multi year patent peace agreement with altera 
fujitsu on september   we entered into an advance payment and purchase agreement the fujitsu app agreement with fujitsu limited fujitsu  pursuant to which we advanced million to fujitsu in support of the development and construction of a mm wafer fabrication facility in mie  japan 
the initial two payments of million each were made in october and january  and a third payment of million was made in november the final payment of million was accrued and recorded at december  and was paid in january during the third quarter of fiscal  we entered into an amendment amendment to the fujitsu app agreement 
prior to the amendment  our million advance was to be credited against the purchase price of mm wafers received from fujitsu 
the amendment permits us to also credit the advance against the purchase price of mm wafers 
the fujitsu app agreement will continue until the full amount of the advance payment has been returned to us in the form of wafer credits or other repayment  subject to the right of either party to terminate the agreement upon the occurrence of certain events 
prior to the amendment  we could request a refund of the unused amount of the advance payment if we have not used all of our wafer credits by december  pursuant to the amendment  we may request a refund of the unused amount of the advance payment if we have not used all of our wafer credits by december  the repayment obligation of fujitsu is unsecured 
seiko epson epson electronics america epson electronics america  inc eea  an affiliated us distributor of seiko epson  has agreed to provide us with manufactured wafers in quantities based on six month rolling forecasts 
prices for the wafers obtained from eea are reviewed and adjusted periodically 
wafers for our products are manufactured in japan at seiko epson s wafer fabrication facilities and are delivered to us by eea 
in we entered into an advance production payment agreement with seiko epson and eea which was subsequently amended in and march under this agreement we advanced million to seiko epson to finance construction of an eight inch sub micron semiconductor wafer manufacturing facility 
as of december  all of the payments have been repaid to us in the form of semiconductor wafers 
we are not obligated to make additional payments under this agreement 
umc group in  we entered into a series of agreements with united microelectronics corporation umc  a public taiwanese company  pursuant to which we agreed to join umc and several other companies to form a separate taiwanese corporation  uicc  for the purpose of building and operating an advanced semiconductor manufacturing facility in taiwan  china 
under the terms of the agreements  we invested million for an approximate equity interest in the corporation and the right to receive a percentage of the facility s wafer production at market prices 
in  we entered into an agreement with utek corporation utek  a public taiwanese company in the wafer foundry business that became affiliated with the umc group in  pursuant to which we agreed to make a series of equity investments in utek under specific terms 
in exchange for these investments  we received the right to purchase a percentage of utek s wafer production 
under this agreement  we invested million 
on january   uicc and utek merged into umc 
for financial reporting purposes  all of our shares of umc common stock are accounted for as available for sale and marked to market in our consolidated balance sheet until they are sold  at which time a gain or loss is recognized in our consolidated statement of operations 
unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss income within stockholders equity 
an other than temporary impairment of umc share value could result in a reduction of the consolidated balance sheet carrying value and would result in a charge to our consolidated statement of operations 
employees at december   we had full time employees 
we believe that our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled technical and management personnel 
no employee is subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
we have never experienced a work stoppage and consider our employee relations to be good

risk factors 
the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report should be carefully considered 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry may limit our ability to maintain revenue levels and operating results during industry downturns 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical  to a greater extent than other less technology driven industries 
our financial performance has periodically been negatively affected by downturns in the semiconductor industry 
factors that contribute to these industry downturns include the cyclical nature of the demand for the products of semiconductor customers  general reductions in inventory levels by customers  excess production capacity  general decline in end user demand  and accelerated declines in average selling prices 
historically  the semiconductor industry has experienced periodic downturns of varying degrees of severity and duration 
typically  after such downturns  semiconductor industry conditions improve  although such improvement may not be significant or sustainable 
increased demand for semiconductor industry products may not proportionately increase demand for programmable logic products in general  or our products in particular 
even if demand for our products increases  average selling prices for our products may not increase  and could decline 
whenever adverse semiconductor industry conditions or other similar conditions exist  there is likely to be an adverse effect on our operating results 
further  our ability to predict end user demand is limited 
typically  the majority of our revenue comes from turns orders  which are orders placed and filled within the same quarter 
by definition  turns orders are not captured in a backlog measurement at the beginning of a quarter 
accordingly  we cannot use backlog as a reliable measure of predicting revenue 
a downturn in the communications equipment end market or computing end market could cause a reduction in demand for our products and limit our ability to maintain revenue levels and operating results 
the majority of our revenue is derived from customers in the communications equipment and computing end markets 
any deterioration in these end markets or any reduction in technology capital spending could lead to a reduction in demand for our products 
for example  in the past  a general weakening in demand for programmable logic products from customers in the communications end market has adversely affected our revenue 
whenever adverse economic or end market conditions exist  there is likely to be an adverse effect on our operating results 
we may be unsuccessful in defining  developing or selling the new fpga products required to maintain or expand our business 
as a semiconductor company  we operate in a dynamic environment marked by rapid product obsolescence 
the programmable logic market is characterized by rapid technology and product evolution and historically the market for fpga products has grown faster than the market for pld products 
currently we derive a greater proportion of our revenue from pld products than fpga products 
consequently  our future success depends on our ability to introduce new fpga and associated software design tool products that meet evolving customer needs while achieving acceptable margins 
we are presently shipping our next generation fpga product families that are critical to our ability to grow our fpga product revenue and expand our overall revenue 
we also plan to continue upgrading our customer design tool products and increase our offerings of intellectual property cores 
if we fail to introduce new products in a timely manner  or if these products or future new products fail to achieve market acceptance  our operating results would be harmed 
fujitsu has agreed to manufacture our current and future fpga products on its nanometer and nanometer cmos process technologies  as well as on nanometer and nanometer technologies with embedded flash memory that we have jointly developed with fujitsu 
we have access to nanometer cmos process technology from fujitsu 
fujitsu is our sole source supplier for our newest fpga products  our new wafer fabrication processes and our planned future fpga products 
the success of our next generation fpga products is dependent on our ability to successfully partner with fujitsu 
if for any reason we are unsuccessful in our efforts to partner with fujitsu in connection with these next generation fpga products  our future revenue growth would be materially adversely affected 
the introduction of new silicon and software design tool products in a dynamic market environment presents significant business challenges 
product development commitments and expenditures must be made well in advance of product sales 
the market reception of new products depends on accurate projections of long term customer demand  which by their nature are uncertain 
our future revenue growth is dependent on market acceptance of our new silicon and software design tool products and the continued market acceptance of our current products 
the success of these products is dependent on a variety of specific technical factors including successful product definition  timely and efficient completion of product design  timely and efficient implementation of wafer manufacturing and assembly processes  product performance  product cost  and the quality and reliability of the product 
if  due to these or other factors  our new silicon and software products do not achieve market acceptance  our operating results would be harmed 
the potential impact of customer design in activity on future revenue is inherently uncertain and could impact our ability to manage production or our ability to forecast sales 
we face uncertainties relating to the potential impact of customer design in activity because it is unknown whether any particular customer design in will ultimately result in sales of significant volume 
after a specific customer design in is obtained  many factors can impact the timing and amount of sales that are ultimately realized from the specific customer design in 
changes in the competitive position of our technology  our customer s product competitiveness  our customer s product strategy  the financial position of our customer  and many other factors can all impact the timing and amount of sales ultimately realized from any specific customer design in 
as a result  we may not be able to accurately manage the production levels of our new products or accurately forecast the future sales of such products  and  thus  our operating results could be harmed 
our products may not be competitive if we are unsuccessful in migrating our manufacturing processes to more advanced technologies or alternative fabrication facilities 
to develop new products and maintain the competitiveness of existing products  we need to migrate to more advanced wafer manufacturing processes that use smaller device geometries 
we also may need to use additional foundries 
because we depend upon foundries to provide their facilities and support for our process technology development  we may experience delays in the availability of advanced wafer manufacturing process technologies at existing or new wafer fabrication facilities 
as a result  volume production of our advanced process technologies at fabrication facilities may not be achieved 
this could harm our operating results 
our wafer supply could be interrupted or reduced  which may result in a shortage of products available for sale 
we do not manufacture finished silicon wafers and many of our products  including all of our newest fpga products  are manufactured by a sole source 
currently  our silicon wafers are manufactured by fujitsu in japan  seiko epson in japan  umc in taiwan and chartered semiconductor in singapore 
if any of our current or future foundry partners significantly interrupts or reduces our wafer supply  our operating results could be harmed 
in the past  we have experienced delays in obtaining wafers and in securing supply commitments from our foundries 
at present  we anticipate that our supply commitments are adequate 
however  these existing supply commitments may not be sufficient for us to satisfy customer demand in future periods 
additionally  notwithstanding our supply commitments  we may still have difficulty in obtaining wafer deliveries consistent with the supply commitments 
we negotiate wafer prices and supply commitments from our suppliers on at least an annual basis 
if any of our foundry partners were to reduce its supply commitment or increase its wafer prices  and we cannot find alternative sources of wafer supply  our operating results could be harmed 
many other factors that could disrupt our wafer supply are beyond our control 
since worldwide manufacturing capacity for silicon wafers is limited and inelastic  we could be harmed by significant industry wide increases in overall wafer demand or interruptions in wafer supply 
additionally  a future disruption of any of our foundry partners foundry operations as a result of a fire  earthquake  act of terrorism  political unrest  governmental uncertainty  war  or other natural disaster or catastrophic event could disrupt our wafer supply and could harm our operating results 
if our foundry partners experience quality or yield problems  we may face a shortage of products available for sale 
we depend on our foundries to deliver high quality silicon wafers with acceptable yields in a timely manner 
as is common in our industry  we have experienced wafer yield problems and delivery delays 
if our foundries are unable for a prolonged period to produce silicon wafers that meet our specifications  with acceptable yields  our operating results could be harmed 
the reliable manufacture of high performance programmable logic devices is a complicated and technically demanding process requiring a high degree of technical skill  state of the art equipment  the availability of certain basic materials and supplies  such as chemicals  gases  polysilicon  silicon wafers and ultra pure metals  the absence of defects in production wafers  the elimination of minute impurities and errors in each step of the fabrication process  and effective cooperation between the wafer supplier and us 
as a result  our foundries may experience difficulties in achieving acceptable quality and yield levels when manufacturing our silicon wafers 
our supply of assembled and tested products could be interrupted or reduced  which may result in a shortage of products available for sale 
we do not assemble our finished products or perform all testing of our products 
currently  our finished products are assembled and tested by ase in malaysia  amkor in the philippines and south korea  fujitsu in japan  ait in indonesia  and other independent contractors in asia 
if any of our current or future assembly or test contractors significantly interrupts or reduces our supply of assembled and tested devices  our operating results could be harmed 
in the past  we have experienced delays in obtaining assembled and tested products and in securing assembly and test capacity commitments from our suppliers 
at present  we anticipate that our assembly and test capacity commitments are adequate 
however  these existing commitments may not be sufficient for us to satisfy customer demand in future periods 
additionally  notwithstanding our assembly and test capacity commitments we may still have difficulty in obtaining deliveries of finished products consistent with the capacity commitments 
we negotiate assembly and test prices and capacity commitments from our contractors on a periodic basis 
if any of our assembly or test contractors were to reduce its capacity commitment or increase its prices  and we cannot find alternative sources  our operating results could be harmed 
many other factors that could disrupt our supply of finished products are beyond our control 
since worldwide capacity for assembly and testing of semiconductor products is limited and inelastic  we could be harmed by significant industry wide increases in overall demand or interruptions in supply 
the assembly of complex packages requires a consistent supply of a variety of raw materials such as substrates  leadframes  and mold compound 
the worldwide manufacturing capacity for these materials is also limited and inelastic 
a significant industry wide increase in demand  or interruptions in the supply of these materials to our assembly or test contractors  could harm our operating results 
additionally  a future disruption of any of our assembly or test contractors operations as a result of a fire  earthquake  act of terrorism  political unrest  governmental uncertainty  war  or other natural disaster or catastrophic event could disrupt our supply of assembled and tested devices and could harm our operating results 
in addition  our quarterly revenue levels may be affected to a significant extent by our ability to match inventory and current production mix with the product mix required to fulfill orders 
the large number of individual parts we sell and the large number of customers for our products  combined with limitations on our and our customer s ability to forecast orders accurately and our relatively lengthy manufacturing cycles  may make it difficult to achieve a match of inventory on hand  production units  and shippable orders sufficient to realize quarterly or annual revenue projections 
if our assembly and test supply contractors experience quality or yield problems  we may face a shortage of products available for sale 
we rely on contractors to assemble and test our devices with acceptable quality and yield levels 
as is common in our industry  we have experienced quality and yield problems in the past 
if we experience prolonged quality or yield problems in the future  our operating results could be harmed 
the majority of our revenue is derived from semiconductor devices assembled in advanced packages 
the assembly of advanced packages is a complex process requiring a high degree of technical skill  state of the art equipment  the absence of defects in assembly and packaging manufacturing  the elimination of raw material impurities and errors in each step of the process  and effective cooperation between the assembly contractor and us 
as a result  our contractors may experience difficulties in achieving acceptable quality and yield levels when assembling and testing our semiconductor devices 
product quality problems could lead to reduced revenue  gross margins  and net income 
we generally warrant our products for varying lengths of time against non conformance to our specifications and certain other defects 
because our products  including hardware and software  are highly complex and incorporate leading edge technology  our quality assurance programs may not detect all defects  whether manufacturing defects in individual products or systematic defects that could affect numerous shipments 
on occasion we have repaired or replaced certain components and software or refund the purchase price or license fee paid by our customers due to product defects 
if there are material increases in warranty claims or the costs to resolve warranty claims compared with our historical experience  our revenue  gross margins  and net income may be adversely affected 
for example  an inability to cure a product defect in a timely manner could result in product reengineering expenses  increased inventory costs  or damage to our reputation  any of which could materially impact our revenue  gross margins  and net income 
conditions in asia may disrupt our existing supply arrangements and result in a shortage of finished products available for sale 
all of our major silicon wafer suppliers operate fabrication facilities located in asia 
additionally  our finished silicon wafers are assembled and tested by independent contractors located in china  indonesia  japan  malaysia  the philippines and south korea 
economic  financial  social and political conditions in asia have historically been volatile 
financial difficulties  the effects of currency fluctuation  governmental actions or restrictions  prolonged work stoppages  political unrest  war  natural disaster  disease or any other difficulties experienced by our suppliers may disrupt our supply and could harm our operating results 
export sales account for the majority of our revenue and may decline in the future due to economic and governmental uncertainties 
we derive a majority of our revenue from export sales 
accordingly  if we experience a decline in export sales  our operating results could be harmed 
our export sales are subject to numerous risks  including changes in local economic conditions  exchange rate volatility  governmental controls and trade restrictions  export license requirements and restrictions on the export of technology  political instability  war or terrorism  changes in tax rates  tariffs or freight rates  interruptions in air transportation  and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales offices 
we may not be able to successfully compete in the highly competitive semiconductor industry 
the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and many of our direct and indirect competitors have substantially greater financial  technological  manufacturing  marketing and sales resources 
if we are unable to compete successfully in this environment  our future results will be adversely affected 
the current level of competition in the programmable logic market is high and may increase in the future 
we currently compete directly with companies that have licensed our technology or have developed similar products 
we also compete indirectly with numerous semiconductor companies that offer products based on alternative technical solutions 
these direct and indirect competitors are established multinational semiconductor companies as well as emerging companies 
we may fail to retain or attract the specialized technical and management personnel required to successfully operate our business 
to a greater degree than most non technology companies or larger technology companies  our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and management personnel 
as a mid sized company  we are particularly dependent on a relatively small group of key employees 
competition for skilled technical and management employees is intense within our industry 
as a result  we may not be able to retain our existing key technical and management personnel 
in addition  we may not be able to attract additional qualified employees in the future 
if we are unable to retain existing key employees or are unable to hire new qualified employees  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we may have failed to adequately insure against certain risks  and  as a result  our financial condition and results may be adversely affected 
we carry insurance customary for companies in our industry  including  but not limited to  liability  property and casualty  worker s compensation and business interruption insurance 
we also self insure our employees for basic medical expenses  subject to a true insurance stop loss for catastrophic illness 
in addition  we have insurance contracts that provide director and officer liability coverage for our directors and officers 
other than the specific areas mentioned above  we are self insured with respect to most other risks and exposures  and the insurance we carry in many cases is subject to a significant policy deductible or other limitation before coverage applies 
based on management s assessment and judgment  we have determined that it is more cost effective to self insure against certain risks than to incur the insurance premium costs 
the risks and exposures for which we self insure include  but are not limited to  natural disasters  product defects  political risk  theft  patent infringement and some employment practice matters 
should there be a catastrophic loss due to an uninsured event such as an earthquake or a loss due to adverse occurrences in any area in which we are self insured  our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity may be adversely affected 
changes in accounting for equity compensation will adversely affect our consolidated statement of operations and could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees 
we have historically used equity incentives as a key component of employee compensation in order to align employees interests with the interests of our stockholders  encourage employee retention  and provide competitive compensation packages 
the financial accounting standards board has adopted changes to generally accepted accounting principles that require us and other companies to record a charge to earnings for employee stock option grants and other equity incentives beginning in the quarter ended april  to the extent that these or other new regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant stock options and other equity incentives to employees  we will incur increased compensation costs 
we may also change our equity compensation strategy  and this could make it difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees 
any of these results could materially and adversely affect our business 
if we are unable to effectively and efficiently improve our internal controls in response to changing business  accounting and regulatory factors there could be a material adverse effect on our operations or financial results 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully maintain  change and enhance as appropriate  our internal controls and procedures  or that any changes or enhancements to our controls and procedures will have the desired effect 
in addition  we may be required to hire additional employees  and may experience higher than anticipated capital expenditures and operating expenses  during the implementation of any changes and enhancements and thereafter 
furthermore  future assessments of our internal controls and procedures may reveal material weaknesses 
if we are unable to maintain  and effectively and efficiently change and enhance as appropriate  our internal controls and procedures  or if we discover material weaknesses  there could be a material adverse effect on our operations or financial results 
if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  our financial results and competitive position may suffer 
our success depends in part on our proprietary technology 
however  we may fail to adequately protect this technology 
as a result  we may lose our competitive position or face significant expense to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights 
we intend to continue to protect our proprietary technology through patents  copyrights and trade secrets 
despite this intention  we may not be successful in achieving adequate protection 
claims allowed on any of our patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
patents issued to us also may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
finally  our competitors may develop similar technology independently 
companies in the semiconductor industry vigorously pursue their intellectual property rights 
if we become involved in protracted intellectual property disputes or litigation we may be forced to use substantial financial and management resources  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
our industry is characterized by frequent claims regarding patents and other intellectual property rights of others 
we have been  and from time to time expect to be  notified of claims that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of others 
if any third party makes a valid claim against us  we could face significant liability and could be required to make material changes to our products and processes 
in response to any claims of infringement  we may seek licenses under patents that we are alleged to be infringing 
however  we may not be able to obtain a license on favorable terms  or at all  without our operating results being adversely affected 
we face risks related to litigation 
we are exposed to certain asserted and unasserted potential claims 
there can be no assurance that  with respect to potential claims made against us  we could resolve such claims under terms and conditions that would not have a material adverse effect on our business  our liquidity or our financial results 
we have been and may in the future be subject to various other legal proceedings  including  as discussed in greater detail hereafter  claims that involve possible infringement of patent and other intellectual property rights of third parties 
it is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of litigation matters  and there can be no assurance that we will prevail in any litigation 
any such litigation could result in a substantial diversion of our efforts and the use of substantial management and financial resources  which by itself could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
further  an adverse determination in any such litigation could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position and the results of operations for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable 
our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate and therefore may fail to meet expectations 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate 
consequently  our operating results may fail to meet the expectations of analysts and investors 
as a result of industry conditions and the following specific factors  our quarterly operating results are more likely to fluctuate and are more difficult to predict than a typical non technology company of our size and maturity general economic conditions in the countries where we sell our products  conditions within the end markets into which we sell our products  the cyclical nature of demand for our customers products  excessive inventory accumulation by our end customers  the timing of our and our competitors new product introductions  product obsolescence  the scheduling  rescheduling and cancellation of large orders by our customers  the willingness and ability of our customers and distributors to make payment to us in a timely manner  our ability to develop new process technologies and achieve volume production at wafer fabrication facilities  changes in manufacturing yields including delays in achieving target yields on new products  adverse movements in exchange rates  interest rates or tax rates  and the availability of adequate supply commitments from our wafer foundries and assembly and test subcontractors 
our stock price may continue to experience large fluctuations 
historically  the price of our common stock has at times experienced rapid and severe price fluctuations that have left investors little time to react 
the price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate greatly in the future due to a variety of company specific factors  including quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  shortfalls in revenue or earnings from levels expected by investors  announcements of technological innovations or new products by other companies  and any developments that materially adversely impact investors perceptions of our business prospects 
at december   our book value per share was compared to our stock price  which has ranged from a low of per share to a high of per share for fiscal presently  our stock price is trading above our consolidated book value 
should our stock price drop below book value for a sustained period  it may become necessary to record an impairment charge to goodwill  which would negatively impact our results of operations

item legal proceedings 
in september and october  three putative class action complaints were filed in the united states district court for the district of oregon against lattice semiconductor corporation  our chief executive officer and president stephen a 
skaggs  and our former chief executive officer cyrus y 
tsui 
these complaints were filed on behalf of a putative class of investors who purchased our stock between april  and april  they generally alleged violations of federal securities laws arising out of our previously announced restatement of financial results for the first  second  and third quarters of consistent with the usual procedures for cases of this kind  these cases were amended and consolidated into a single action 
in an amended and consolidated complaint filed january  our former president and our former controller were added as defendants 
the complaints generally sought an unspecific amount of damages  as well as attorney fees and costs 
on march  the company announced it had entered into an agreement with the plaintiffs to settle the consolidated action 
the agreement does not contain any admission of fault or wrongdoing on the part of the company or any of the individual defendants in the litigation  and provides that plaintiffs will receive an aggregate amount of million  inclusive of fees and expenses of counsel  in exchange for a release of the company and the individual defendants from all claims asserted in the litigation 
the company s insurance carriers have paid the entire amount  on behalf of the company  to settle the suit under the terms of the company s director and officer liability insurance policy 
on november   the court formally approved the settlement and issued an order of dismissal with prejudice 
the company had previously recorded a liability in its financial statements for the proposed amount of the settlement 
additionally  because the insurance carriers had agreed to pay the entire million settlement amount  a receivable was also recorded for the same amount 
accordingly  there was no impact to the consolidated statement of operations as the amounts of the settlement and the insurance recovery fully offset 
with the final settlement and dismissal of the litigation with prejudice  the offsetting receivable and liability have been reversed as of december  we previously announced that the sec had been conducting an informal inquiry into our restatement of financial results for the first  second  and third quarters of we also previously announced that our audit committee conducted an internal examination concerning issues primarily associated with executive compensation and several items pertaining to our internal controls 
we have furnished information regarding our restatement and the other matters examined by the audit committee to the sec 
on september  the sec issued a cease and desist order concerning our former controller  and referenced certain events in connection with our prior restatement of financial results 
in september  we made a settlement offer to the sec to resolve the informal inquiry 
we offered to consent to the entry of a cease and desist order with respect to violations of sections a and b a b of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and rule a promulgated thereunder 
the proposed settlement was approved by the sec  and on january  the sec issued an order instituting cease and desist proceedings  making findings  and imposing a cease and desist order pursuant to section c of the securities exchange act of we are exposed to certain asserted and unasserted potential claims 
there can be no assurance that  with respect to potential claims made against us  we could resolve such claims under terms and conditions that would not have a material adverse effect on our business  our liquidity  our financial position or our operating results

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
lattice semiconductor corporation the company designs  develops and markets high performance programmable logic products and related software 
programmable logic products are widely used semiconductor components that can be configured by the end customer as specific logic circuits  and enable the end customer to shorten design cycle times and reduce development costs 
within the programmable logic market there are two groups of products programmable logic devices plds and field programmable gate arrays fpgas each representing a distinct silicon architectural approach 
products based on the two alternative programmable logic architectures are generally optimal for different types of logic functions  although many logic functions can be implemented using either architecture 
we believe that a substantial portion of programmable logic customers utilize both pld and fpga architectures 
our end customers are primarily original equipment manufacturers in the communications  computing  industrial  consumer  automotive  medical and military end markets 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
a description of our critical accounting policies follows 
use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and classification of assets  such as accounts receivable  inventory and deferred income taxes and liabilities  such as accrued liabilities  income taxes and deferred income and allowances on sales to certain distributors  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the fiscal periods presented 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition and deferred income 
revenue from sales to customers is generally recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  title has transferred  collection of resulting receivables is probable  there are no customer acceptance requirements and no remaining significant obligations 
certain of our sales are made to distributors under agreements providing price protection and right of return on unsold merchandise 
revenue and cost relating to such distributor sales are deferred until either the product is sold by the distributor or return privileges and price protection rights terminate  at which time related estimated distributor resale revenue  estimated effects of distributor price adjustments  and estimated costs are reflected in income 
revenue from software licensing was not material for the periods presented 
beginning in fiscal we entered into arrangements with certain distributors to issue accounts receivable credit adjustments distributor advances to reduce the distributors working capital required to service our end customers 
the distributor advances are for estimated future price discounts and are recorded as a reduction of deferred income and allowances on sales to distributors 
these arrangements are unsecured  bear no interest  are settled on a quarterly basis and are due upon demand 
the distributor advances have no impact on revenue recognition 
inventory 
we value inventory at the lower of cost or market on a quarterly basis 
in addition  we write down unproven  excess and obsolete inventories to net realizable value 
to value our inventory  we make a number of estimates and assumptions including market and economic conditions  product lifecycles and forecasted demand for our products 
to the extent actual results differ from these estimates and assumptions  the balances of reported inventory and cost of products sold will change accordingly 
long lived assets 
we account for our long lived assets  primarily property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the disposal of long lived assets  which requires us to review the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted cash flows to the carrying amount 
a loss is recorded if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows 
intangible assets are generally being amortized over five years  and fifteen years for income tax purposes  on a straight line basis 
restructuring charges 
restructuring charges are recognized and recorded at fair value as incurred in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
restructuring costs include severance and other costs related to employee terminations  facility costs related to abandonment of various leased research and development sites  and other costs associated with the exit and disposal activities 
as changes to these estimates occur in subsequent periods resulting from timing changes or other factors  we will record either an increase or decrease to the estimated costs previously recorded 
it is possible that actual costs incurred in the future will differ from the amounts recorded at december  accounting for income taxes 
to report income tax expense related to operating results  we record current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
in determining the value of our deferred tax assets  we make estimates of future taxable income 
at the end of fiscal years  and  we have recorded full valuation allowances for all of our us deferred tax assets due to uncertainties regarding their realization 
at the end of fiscal years and  we have recorded a partial valuation allowance against our foreign deferred tax assets 
we had no foreign deferred tax assets at the end of fiscal in addition  in determining the value of income tax liabilities we make estimates of the results of future examinations of our income tax returns by taxing authorities 
we believe that we have adequately provided in our consolidated financial statements for additional taxes that we estimate may result from these examinations 
if these amounts provided prove to be more than what is necessary  the reversal of the reserves would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period in which we determine the liability is no longer necessary 
if an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities  an additional charge to expense will result 
see note and note to our consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation 
in the first quarter of  we adopted share based payment a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
r  which requires the measurement at fair value and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under stock purchase plans at the date of grant requires judgment 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of these share based awards consistent with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
option pricing models  including the black scholes model  also require the use of input assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  expected dividend rate  and expected risk free rate of return 
the assumptions for expected volatility and expected life are the two assumptions that significantly affect the grant date fair value 
upon the adoption of sfas no 
r effective january   stock compensation expense related to acquisitions attributable to research and development activities and previously classified as part of amortization of intangible assets has been reclassified to research and development expense 
such deferred stock compensation attributable to research and development activities was completely recognized as of april  results of operations revenue revenue in fiscal increased to million as compared to million in fiscal primarily due to growth of new products and fpga products as well as strength in the communications  consumer and military end markets 
during fiscal  total units sold increased by while overall average selling price was relatively constant when compared to fiscal the increase in units sold was a result of overall growth in the programmable logic market along with increased market share 
revenue in fiscal decreased to million as compared to million in fiscal primarily due to weakness in the communications  computing and industrial end markets 
during fiscal  total units sold decreased by four percent and average selling price declined by two percent when compared to fiscal the communications end market accounted for approximately of our revenue in fiscal years  and accordingly  a significant portion of our revenue is dependent on the health of this end market 
the communications end market weakened in the later portion of fiscal  slowly improved throughout and the first half of before weakening in the later part of revenue by product line from a product line viewpoint  in fiscal there was a increase in fpga units sold  partially offset by a decrease in average selling price when compared to fiscal for pld products in fiscal  units sold increased  partially offset by a one percent decrease in average selling price when compared to fiscal pld and fpga product revenue decreased six percent and eight percent  respectively  for fiscal compared to the composition of our revenue by product line for fiscal years  and was as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  december  january  fpga pld total revenue revenue by product classification revenue for new  mainstream and mature products  increased  and three percent  respectively  for fiscal compared to the fiscal decrease in units sold was predominantly attributable to lower sales of mainstream and mature products due to reduced end market demand while the decrease in average selling price was primarily due to product mix 
among other things  future revenue growth is dependent on overall economic conditions for our industry and market acceptance of our new products 
the composition of our revenue by product classification for fiscal years  and was as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  december  january  new mainstream mature total revenue product classification new latticesc  latticeecp m  latticeecp  latticexp  machxo  fpsc  ispxpld  ispgdx  power manager  ispclock mainstream ispmach z  ispxpga  ispgdx v  ispmach lv  isplsi v  isplsi v  ispmach vg  software and ip mature orca  orca  orca  isppac  isplsi v  ispmach b  ispmach lv  ispmach lv  all volt cplds  all splds beginning in fiscal we reclassified our new  mainstream and mature product categories to better reflect our current product portfolio 
the new product category was narrowed  and as such several products were removed from our new product category and are now classified as mainstream 
as part of the change to product categories  we also reclassified certain products from mainstream to mature 
prior period ratios have been recalculated to reflect these new product category classifications 
newly released product families have also been added to the new product classification 
we periodically update our product classifications and plan to update our classifications again in fiscal revenue by geography revenue from export sales as a percentage of total revenue was for fiscal  for and for export revenue as a percentage of overall revenue increased in fiscal compared to and due to relatively more favorable business conditions in asia and a continuing trend towards outsourcing of manufacturing by north american customers 
the composition of our revenue by geographical location of our direct and indirect customers is as follows in thousands year ended december  december  january  united states export revenue europe china japan taiwan other asia other americas total export revenue total revenue stock based compensation expense effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method and therefore have not restated results for prior periods 
our results of operations in fiscal were impacted by the recognition of non cash expense related to the fair value of our stock based payment awards 
for the year ended december  we recognized million of stock based compensation expense  of which million was included in cost of products sold  million was included in research and development and million was included in selling  general and administrative expense 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item  which is incorporated herein by reference 
gross margin and operating expenses key elements of our consolidated statement of operations  expressed as a percentage of revenue  were as follows year ended december  december  january  revenue gross margin research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of intangible assets restructuring charges loss from operations our statement of operations includes the effect of stock based compensation as quantified in note to the consolidated financial statements in item our gross margin percentage was for fiscal  for and for the increase in gross margin percentage from fiscal to reflects revenue growth in mainstream products  which had an improved margin in fiscal versus due to yield enhancements and cost reductions 
the decline in gross margin percentage from fiscal to resulted primarily from revenue growth in new products  which typically carry an initial lower gross margin and a decline in revenue from mature products  which typically carry a higher gross margin 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of fiscal we initiated a last time buy program to recognize the obsolescence of certain mature products  resulting in a charge to cost of products sold to write down excess inventory 
research and development expense was million for fiscal compared to million for and million for research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel  masks  engineering wafers  third party design automation software  assembly tooling and qualification expenses 
the decrease in expense in fiscal compared to is primarily a result of the restructuring plan implemented during the fourth quarter of fiscal restructuring plan  which is further described below 
in addition  the decrease also resulted from elimination of stock compensation expense related to previous acquisitions 
although we experienced a considerable decline in research and development expense during fiscal compared to  we believe that a continued commitment to research and development is essential in order to maintain product leadership and provide innovative new product offerings  and therefore we expect to continue to make significant future investments in research and development 
as we continue to move to more advanced process technologies such as nm and beyond  mask and engineering wafer costs are becoming increasingly more expensive and will therefore increasingly represent a greater proportion of total research and development expenses 
the increase in fiscal when compared to the prior year resulted primarily from mask and engineering wafer costs for the completion of new products  and to a lesser extent  personnel related costs 
selling  general and administrative expense was million in fiscal  million in and million in the increase in fiscal compared to is due to a number of factors including a reduction of sublease income  which is recorded as an offset to selling  general and administrative expense  recognition of stock compensation  increased commission and compensation related expense and the restructuring plan  which is further described below 
these increases were mostly offset by a million reduction in legal expenses in fiscal compared to the fiscal increase compared to was primarily due to legal expenses related to shareholder class action suits  an sec informal inquiry  shareholder derivative suits  a special litigation committee investigation and audit committee investigation  all of which were resolved at december  legal expenses related to these matters resulted in a total charge of million during fiscal and million in these increases in legal expenses were partially offset by decreases primarily in consulting services  sales related expenses and other miscellaneous items 
amortization of intangible assets is related to our acquisition of the fpga business of agere systems inc and of cerdelinx and our acquisition of vantis corporation 
amortization expense was million in fiscal  million in and million in amortization expense in fiscal decreased as a portion of the intangible assets acquired in the agere acquisition became completely amortized 
the decrease in amortization expense in fiscal compared to was attributable to completion of amortization of certain intangible assets from the vantis and agere acquisitions 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we initiated and substantially completed the restructuring plan to reduce operating expenses and improve efficiency 
the restructuring encompassed three major components a streamlining of research and development sites  a voluntary separation program for certain employees and an organizational consolidation within the company s largest design center 
these actions did not significantly impact our product direction or product roll out strategy 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded an initial restructuring charge of million which included million of severance related costs  million of lease related costs and million of other costs  including a million write off of an intellectual property license 
restructuring charges decreased significantly to million in fiscal all of our restructuring accruals at december  are related to the restructuring plan 
effective january   the company realigned certain departments and job responsibilities 
as a result  a portion of the historic cost center allocations have been realigned between selling  general and administrative and research and development to reflect our operations following the restructuring plan 
the realignment reduced fiscal research and development expense by approximately million  which was primarily offset by a corresponding increase in selling  general and administrative expense 
the following table displays the current estimate for each major type of cost associated with the restructuring plan in thousands balance  at december  charged to expense paid or settled adjustments to reserve balance  at december  expense year ended december  aggregate expense and adjustments severance and related costs lease loss reserve other total included in expense amounts for the year ended december  are disposals of leasehold improvements and fixed assets totaling million and million  respectively 
the above restructuring charges are based on estimates that are subject to change 
lease charges change based on our ability to either generate sublease income or terminate lease obligations at the amounts estimated  and are dependent upon lease market conditions at the time we negotiate the potential lease arrangements 
variance from these estimates could alter our ability to achieve anticipated expense reductions in the planned timeframe and modify our expected cash outflows and working capital 
although the restructuring plan was substantially completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we cannot be certain as to the actual amount of any remaining restructuring charges or the timing of their recognition for financial reporting purposes  though the amount of future charges in addition to the current reserve is not expected to be significant 
interest and other income expense  net interest income was million in fiscal  million in and million in the increases in fiscal compared to  and in compared to  are primarily attributable to higher interest rates 
other income  net  was million in fiscal  million in and million in for fiscal  other income  net  consisted of a million gain on sale of umc common stock and a million gain on extinguishment of zero coupon convertible subordinated notes due in convertible notes  net of million of amortization of convertible note issuance costs and other costs 
for fiscal  other income  net  consisted primarily of a million gain on sale of umc common stock and a million gain on extinguishment of convertible notes  net of million amortization of convertible note issuance costs and other costs 
for fiscal  other income  net  consisted of a million gain on sale of umc common stock and a million gain on extinguishment of convertible notes  net of million amortization of convertible note issuance costs and other costs 
to the extent market conditions allow  we may make similar extinguishments of our convertible notes and sales of umc common stock in the future 
we are paying foreign income taxes  which are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations  and are primarily related to the cost of operating our offshore research and development and sales subsidiaries 
we are not currently paying federal or state income taxes and do not expect to pay such taxes until the benefits of our tax net operating losses are fully utilized 
we accrue interest expense on our tax contingency reserve 
liquidity and capital resources financial condition sources and uses of cash fiscal compared to operating net cash used in operating activities decreased by million in fiscal as compared to the change is primarily related to recognition of net income in fiscal compared to a net loss in this was offset primarily by an increase in inventories during fiscal  compared to a decrease in due primarily to increased inventories related to new products in fiscal  while reduced starts and fewer receipts of wafers at the end of fiscal reduced the inventory balance 
also contributing to the offset in fiscal was cash used for an advance payment to fujitsu compared to the lesser payment made in in addition  while fiscal includes the charge related to the restructuring plan  the majority of the cash payments related to the restructuring plan were made in fiscal investing net cash provided by investing activities decreased by million for fiscal as compared to the change is due primarily to a decrease in the sale of equity securities principally umc common stock offset by an increase in net proceeds from short term investments 
net proceeds from the sale of equity securities principally umc common stock totaled million for fiscal as compared to million for net proceeds from short term investments totaled in fiscal compared to million in further  capital expenditures were greater in fiscal  totaling million compared to million in financing net cash used in financing activities decreased million for fiscal as compared to the decrease is due primarily to the use of million to extinguish our convertible notes in fiscal compared to million in further  net proceeds from the issuance of common stock for fiscal increased million over fiscal compared to operating net cash used by operating activities was million in fiscal  compared to million of cash provided by operating activities in the change is primarily related to the change in net income after excluding the effect of non cash charges  and a reduction in accounts receivable collections 
this decrease in cash provided by operations was partially offset by an increase in the receipt of wafers credited to wafer advances in fiscal over  and the timing of payments related to the restructuring plan benefited cash flow from operations in fiscal investing net cash provided by investing activities increased by million for fiscal as compared to the change is due primarily to an increase in net proceeds from short term investments offset by the decrease in the sale of equity securities principally umc common stock 
net proceeds from short term investments totaled million in fiscal compared to net purchase of short term investments of million in net proceeds from the sale of equity securities principally umc common stock totaled million for fiscal as compared to million for further  capital expenditures increased in fiscal  totaling million compared to million in financing net cash used in financing activities increased million for fiscal as compared to the increase is due primarily to the use of million to extinguish our convertible notes in fiscal compared to million in further  net proceeds from the issuance of common stock for fiscal decreased million compared to liquidity at december  our principal source of liquidity was million of cash and marketable securities  which was million less than the balance of million at december  working capital decreased by million to million at december  from million at december  this decrease was the result of million paid to extinguish convertible notes  an advance payment of million to fujitsu and capital expenditures of million 
we believe that our existing liquid resources and expected cash generated from future operations  combined with wafer credits from foundries and our ability to borrow additional funds  will be adequate to meet our operating and capital requirements and obligations for the next months 
included in such anticipated obligations at december  was the advance payment to fujitsu of million that was made in january this payment represents the final installment to complete the unsecured advance payments of million to fujitsu for prepaid wafers 
the advance payments will be returned to us in the form of wafer credits or other repayment  subject to the right of either party to terminate the agreement upon the occurrence of certain events 
as of december   million had been returned to us in the form of wafer credits  and we expect an additional million to be returned to us in the form of wafer credits during the next twelve months 
if we do not use all of our wafer credits by december  we may request a refund of the unused amount of the advance payment 
the repayment obligation of fujitsu is unsecured 
from through december   we paid an aggregate of million to extinguish million principal amount of convertible notes  which are due july  in addition  in the first quarter of fiscal we paid million to extinguish million in principal amount of convertible notes 
from time to time we will assess our liquidity and capital resources  and overall economic and market conditions  and may repurchase additional convertible notes prior to their due date 
while the convertible notes are due for payment in  unless previously redeemed  purchased  repurchased or converted  holders of the convertible notes have a right to require payment of the convertible notes on july  at december   million principal amount of the convertible notes remain outstanding 
we may in the future seek new or additional sources of funding 
in addition  in order to secure additional wafer supply  we may from time to time consider various financial arrangements including equity investments  advance purchase payments  loans  or similar arrangements with independent wafer manufacturers in exchange for committed wafer capacity 
to the extent that we pursue any such additional financing arrangements  additional debt or equity financing may be required 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available when needed or  if available  will be on favorable terms 
any future equity financing will decrease existing stockholders equity percentage ownership and may  depending on the price at which the equity is sold  result in dilution 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual cash obligations at december  in thousands fiscal year operating leases purchase order obligations advance payment and purchase agreement zero coupon convertible subordinated notes due july  later years certain of our facilities and equipment are leased under operating leases  which expire at various times through rental expense under the operating leases was million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
included in the table above for operating leases are the properties that were vacated as part of our restructuring plan 
for fiscal  future minimum sublease receipts net of such payments  based on agreements in place at december   total million 
in the first quarter of we entered into a sublease agreement for a portion of the research and development facility in san jose  california and for the vacated premises in austin  texas 
this column excludes amounts already recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as current liabilities at december  this represents our obligation to make the final payment pursuant to the advance payment and purchase agreement with fujitsu limited and is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet at december  on july   holders have the option to require us to purchase all or a portion of their convertible notes in cash at of the principal amount of the convertible notes 
in december  our board of directors authorized management to repurchase up to five million shares of our common stock 
as of december   we had repurchased  shares at an aggregate cost of million 
there were no repurchases of common stock in fiscal years  or our only significant operating leases  apart from those accrued for in the restructuring plan  are for our facilities in san jose  california and bethlehem  pennsylvania 
our lease in san jose expires in december of annual rent is million and increases annually 
our lease in bethlehem expires in august of annual rent is million and increases annually 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the non cancelable lease term or the estimated useful life of the assets 
on september   we entered into an advance payment and purchase agreement the fujitsu app agreement with fujitsu limited fujitsu  pursuant to which we advanced million to fujitsu in support of the development and construction of a mm wafer fabrication facility in mie  japan 
the initial two payments of million each were made in october and january  and a third payment of million was made in november the final payment of million was accrued and recorded at december  and was paid in january during the third quarter of fiscal  we entered into an amendment amendment to the fujitsu app agreement 
prior to the amendment  our million advance was to be credited against the purchase price of mm wafers received from fujitsu 
the amendment permits us to also credit the advance against the purchase price of mm wafers 
the fujitsu app agreement will continue until the full amount of the advance payment has been returned to us in the form of wafer credits or other repayment  subject to the right of either party to terminate the agreement upon the occurrence of certain events 
prior to the amendment  we could request a refund of the unused amount of the advance payment if we have not used all of our wafer credits by december  pursuant to the amendment  we may request a refund of the unused amount of the advance payment if we have not used all of our wafer credits by december  the repayment obligation of fujitsu is unsecured

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december  and december  our investment portfolio consisted of fixed income securities of million and million  respectively 
as with all fixed income instruments  these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
if market rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at the years ended december  and december   the decline in the fair value of our portfolio would not be material

the fair market value of the convertible notes is subject to interest rate risk and market risk due to the convertible feature of the convertible notes and the fair market value of the company s common stock 
generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise

to minimize foreign exchange risk related to yen based net assets on our consolidated balance sheet  on august   we entered into an agreement with a bank under the terms of which we can borrow up to million in japanese yen in a revolving line of credit arrangement 
outstanding borrowing is collateralized by marketable securities 
interest on outstanding borrowing is based on the japanese libor fixed rate  and averaged for the year ended december  outstanding borrowing at december  was million 
this arrangement can be terminated at any time by either party 
we are exposed to equity price risk due to our equity investment in umc see note to our consolidated financial statements 
neither a increase nor a decrease in equity price related to this investment would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements as of the years ended december  or december  we have not attempted to reduce or eliminate this equity price risk through hedging or similar techniques 
as a result  sustained changes in the market price of umc common stock could impact our financial results 
to the extent that the market value of our umc common stock experiences deterioration for an extended period of time  our operating results could be adversely affected
