item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we were incorporated in as a successor to businesses that had been engaged in providing construction services since we provide diversified general contracting  construction management and design build services to private clients and public agencies throughout the world 
our construction business is conducted through three basic segments or operations building  civil and management services 
our building segment has significant experience providing services to a number of high growth  specialized building markets  including the hospitality and gaming  sports and entertainment  education  transportation  healthcare  biotech  pharmaceutical and high tech markets 
our civil segment specializes in public works construction and the repair  replacement and reconstruction of infrastructure  including highways  bridges  mass transit systems and water and wastewater treatment facilities  primarily in the northeastern and mid atlantic united states 
our management services segment provides diversified construction and design build services to the u 
s 
military and federal government agencies  as well as surety companies and multi national corporations in the united states and overseas 
we have been chosen by the federal government for significant projects related to defense and reconstruction in iraq and afghanistan 
the contracting and management services that we provide consist of general contracting  pre construction planning and comprehensive management services  including planning and scheduling the manpower  equipment  materials and subcontractors required for the timely completion of a project in accordance with the terms and specifications contained in a construction contract 
we also offer self performed construction services including site work  concrete forming and placement and steel erection 
we provide these services by using traditional general contracting arrangements  such as fixed price  guaranteed maximum price and cost plus fee contracts and  to a lesser extent  construction management or design build contracting arrangements 
in the ordinary course of our business  we enter into arrangements with other contractors  referred to as joint ventures  for certain construction projects 
each of the joint venture participants is usually committed to supply a predetermined percentage of capital  as required  and to share in a predetermined percentage of the income or loss of the project 
each joint venture participant is fully liable for the obligations of the joint venture 
for the year ended december   we had record revenues of billion  record pretax income of million  and net income of million 
all of our business segments recorded significantly higher profit contributions in compared to we received significant new contract awards  as well as additions to contracts in place  during resulting in a record year end backlog of billion at december  our financial condition strengthened during at december   we had working capital of million  a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of to  and a ratio of long term debt to equity of to 
our solid base of stockholders equity increased to million as of december   reflecting the outstanding operating results achieved over the past five years 
in addition  on february   we closed on a new million credit facility that can be expanded to million in the future 
recent developments redemption of preferred stock on may   we redeemed all remaining outstanding depositary shares at a price of per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends to that date  for an aggregate amount of approximately million 
as a result of the redemption  the holders of depositary shares were not eligible to elect directors at our annual meeting of stockholders 
grant of restricted stock units on april  and may   the compensation committee of our board of directors approved the grant of  restricted stock units to certain of our executive officers and employees under our stock option and incentive plan 
of the restricted stock units granted   vested on june  and  vested on december  of the remaining restricted stock units granted   generally vest equally on december of  and and  generally vest on december  of the restricted stock units granted   including the  restricted stock units that vested in are subject only to satisfaction of service requirements  the remaining  restricted stock units granted are subject to satisfaction of both service requirements and achievement of certain pre established pretax income performance criteria 
upon vesting  each restricted stock unit will be exchanged for one share of our common stock 
we are accounting for these grants of restricted stock units in accordance with sfas no 
r share based payment  beginning in the second quarter of the weighted average grant date fair value of each of these restricted stock units is based on the closing price of our common stock on the dates of grant 
we recognized a million pretax charge in for compensation cost related to these restricted stock units 
the financial impact of the future recognition of compensation cost related to these restricted stock units is expected to be material to our results of operations for through absent significant forfeitures in the future  we estimate that million of compensation cost related to these restricted stock units will be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
amended and restated credit agreement on february   we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with bank of america  na  as administrative agent  and three participant lenders the amended agreement 
the amended agreement amends and restates in its entirety the company s previously existing credit agreement dated as of october   as amended through april  the prior agreement 
the amended agreement provides for a secured revolving credit facility the revolving facility of up to million  which can be expanded to million in the future with the consent of the lenders 
this represents an increased borrowing capacity from the prior agreement  which provided for a revolving credit facility of million  plus a term loan in the original amount of million  of which million was outstanding at december  the term loan was paid in full on february  in conjunction with the closing of the amended agreement 
while the amended agreement also provides for an increase in the aggregate amount of letters of credit that may be issued under the agreement from million to million  any outstanding letters of credit reduce availability under the revolving facility on a dollar for dollar basis 
the termination date of the revolving facility was extended from june  to february  for a more detailed description of the amended agreement  see liquidity and capital resources cash and working capital below 
backlog analysis for we received significant new contract awards  as well as additions to contracts in place  during resulting in a record year end backlog of billion at december  the following table provides an analysis of our backlog by business segment for the year ended december  backlog at new business revenue backlog at december  awarded recognized december  in thousands building    civil    management services    total    new business awarded consists of the original contract price of projects added to our backlog plus or minus subsequent changes to the estimated total contract price of existing contracts 
critical accounting policies our accounting and financial reporting policies are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
although our significant accounting policies are described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k  the following discussion is intended to describe those accounting policies most critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our construction business involves making significant estimates and assumptions in the normal course of business relating to our contracts and our joint venture contracts due to  among other things  the one of a kind nature of most of our projects  the long term duration of our contract cycle and the type of contract utilized 
therefore  management believes that method of accounting for contracts is the most important and critical accounting policy 
the most significant estimates with regard to these financial statements relate to the estimating of total forecasted construction contract revenues  costs and profits in accordance with accounting for long term contracts see note d of notes to consolidated financial statements and estimating potential liabilities in conjunction with certain contingencies  including the outcome of pending or future litigation  arbitration or other dispute resolution proceedings relating to contract claims see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from these estimates and such differences could be material 
our estimates of contract revenue and cost are highly detailed 
we believe  based on our experience  that our current systems of management and accounting controls allow management to produce materially reliable estimates of total contract revenue and cost during any accounting period 
however  many factors can and do change during a contract performance period which can result in a change to contract profitability from one financial reporting period to another 
some of the factors that can change the estimate of total contract revenue and cost include differing site conditions to the extent that contract remedies are unavailable  the availability of skilled contract labor  the performance of major material suppliers to deliver on time  the performance of major subcontractors  unusual weather conditions and the accuracy of the original bid estimate 
because we have many contracts in process at any given time  these changes in estimates can offset each other without impacting overall profitability 
however  large changes in cost estimates on larger  more complex civil construction projects can have a material impact on our financial statements and are reflected in our results of operations when they become known 
when recording revenue on contracts relating to unapproved change orders and claims  we include in revenue an amount equal to the amount of costs incurred by us to date for contract price adjustments that we seek to collect from customers for delays  errors in specifications or designs  change orders in dispute or unapproved as to scope or price  or other unanticipated additional costs  in each case when recovery of the costs is considered probable 
when determining the likelihood of eventual recovery  we consider such factors as evaluation of entitlement  settlements reached to date and our experience with the customer 
the settlement of these issues often takes years depending upon whether the item can be resolved directly with the customer or involves litigation or arbitration 
when new facts become known  an adjustment to the estimated recovery is made and reflected in the current period results 
the amount of unapproved change order and claim revenue is included in our balance sheet as part of unbilled work 
the amount of unbilled work relating to unapproved change orders and claims included in our balance sheet at december  and is summarized below december  in thousands unapproved change orders   claims   of the balance of unapproved change orders and claims included in unbilled work at december  and december   approximately million and million respectively  are amounts subject to pending litigation or dispute resolution proceedings as described in item  legal proceedings and note  contingencies and commitments of notes to consolidated financial statements for the respective periods 
these amounts are management s estimate of the probable recovery from the disputed claims considering such factors as evaluation of entitlement  settlements reached to date and our experience with the customer 
in the event that future facts and circumstances  including the resolution of disputed claims  cause us to reduce the aggregate amount of our estimated probable recovery from the disputed claims  we will record the amount of such reduction against future earnings in the relevant period 
method of accounting for contracts revenues and profits from our contracts and construction joint venture contracts are recognized by applying percentages of completion for the period to the total estimated profits for the respective contracts 
percentage of completion is determined by relating the actual cost of the work performed to date to the current estimated total cost of the respective contracts 
when the estimate on a contract indicates a loss  the entire loss is recorded during the accounting period in which it is estimated 
in the ordinary course of business  at a minimum on a quarterly basis  we prepare updated estimates of the total forecasted revenue  cost and profit or loss for each contract 
the cumulative effect of revisions in estimates of the total forecasted revenue and costs  including unapproved change orders and claims  during the course of the work is reflected in the accounting period in which the facts that caused the revision become known 
the financial impact of these revisions to any one contract is a function of both the amount of the revision and the percentage of completion of the contract 
an amount equal to the costs incurred that are attributable to unapproved change orders and claims is included in the total estimated revenue when realization is probable 
for a further discussion of unapproved change orders and claims  see item  business types of contracts and the contract process and item a  risk factors 
profit from unapproved change orders and claims is recorded in the accounting period such amounts are resolved 
deferred contract revenue represents the excess of billings to date over the amount of contract costs and profits or contract revenue recognized to date on the percentage of completion accounting method 
unbilled work represents the excess of contract costs and profits or contract revenue recognized to date on the percentage of completion accounting method over billings to date 
unbilled work results when the appropriate contract revenue amount has been recognized in accordance with the percentage of completion accounting method  but a portion of the revenue recorded cannot be billed currently due to the billing terms defined in the contract and or costs  recorded at estimated realizable value  related to unapproved change orders or claims are incurred 
for unapproved change orders or claims that cannot be resolved in accordance with the normal change order process as defined in the contract  we may employ other dispute resolution methods  including mediation  binding and non binding arbitration  or litigation 
see item legal proceedings and note  contingencies and commitments of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the prerequisite for billing unapproved change orders and claims is the final resolution and agreement between the parties 
unbilled work related to our contracts and joint venture contracts at december  is discussed above under use of estimates and in note d of notes to consolidated financial statements 
accounting for income taxes information relating to our provision for income taxes and the status of our deferred tax assets and liabilities is presented in note  income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements 
a key assumption in the determination of our book tax provision is the amount of the valuation allowance  if any  required to reduce the related deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance reduces the deferred tax assets to a level which will  more likely than not  be realized 
whether the deferred tax assets will be realized depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the deferred tax assets become deductible 
the net deferred tax assets reflect management s estimate of the amount which will  more likely than not  reduce future taxable income 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  an interpretation of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes  by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognizing  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt fin as of january   as required 
fin requires that the cumulative effect of its adoption be recorded as a change to opening retained earnings in the first quarter of we expect that the adoption of fin will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and effective tax rate and we believe that any adjustment recorded to reduce opening retained earnings will be immaterial 
defined benefit retirement plan the status of our defined benefit pension plan obligations  related plan assets and cost is presented in note of notes to consolidated financial statements entitled employee benefit plans 
plan obligations and annual pension expense are determined by actuaries using a number of key assumptions which include  among other things  the discount rate  the estimated future return on plan assets and the anticipated rate of future salary increases 
the discount rate of used for purposes of computing the annual pension expense was determined at the beginning of the calendar year based on high quality corporate bond yields as of that date 
we plan to change the discount rate used for computing the annual pension expense to based upon an analysis performed by our actuaries which matches the cash flows of our plan s projected liabilities to bond investments of similar amounts and durations 
the estimated return on plan assets is primarily based on historical long term returns of equity and fixed income markets according to our targeted allocation of plan assets equity and fixed income 
we plan to continue to use a return on asset rate of in based on recent equity market performance compared to long term historical averages 
the plans benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of plan assets on december    and accordingly  we adjusted our pension liability by a decrease of million in  and increases of million in and million in  with the offset to accumulated other comprehensive income loss  an increase reduction in stockholders equity 
effective june   all benefit accruals under our pension plan were frozen  however  the current vested benefits will be preserved 
due to the expected change in the discount rate assumption for noted above and to decreased amortization of prior years investment losses in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  we anticipate that pension expense will decrease from million in to million in cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plan are anticipated to be million in  but using our current assumptions regarding asset performance and the interest rate environment  cash contributions may vary significantly in the future 
results of operations compared to revenues increased by billion  gross profit increased by million  income from construction operations increased by million  and net income increased by million or in these increases primarily reflect the addition of rudolph sletten which we acquired in october  an increased volume of work in the hospitality and gaming market as a result of the significant new contract awards we received in the latter half of  and an increased profit contribution from our management services segment 
moreover  the operating results were severely impacted by an after tax charge of million relating to the judgment against two company joint ventures in the matter of mergentime corporation  et al 
vs 
washington metropolitan area transit authority wmata 
without the impact of the wmata charge in  net income would have been million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the operating results for the year ended december  were reduced by a million pretax charge related to stock based compensation expense resulting from restricted stock units granted in basic earnings per common share were for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  diluted earnings per common share were for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  revenues for the year ended december  increase decrease change in millions building    civil management services total    overall revenues increased by billion or  from billion in to billion in this increase was due primarily to an increase in building construction revenues of  million or  from  million in to  million in  due to the addition of rudolph sletten  and to an increased volume of work in the hospitality and gaming market as a result of the significant new contract awards we received in the latter half of without the addition of rudolph sletten  building construction revenues would have increased by million or in civil construction revenues increased by million or  from million in to million in  due primarily to the higher backlog of civil construction work entering compared to partly offsetting these increases was a decrease in management services revenues of million or  from million in to million in  due primarily to a decreased volume of work in afghanistan 
income from construction operations for the year ended december  increase decrease change in millions building civil management services subtotal less corporate total income from construction operations excluding corporate increased by million or  from million in to million in building construction income from operations increased by million or  from million in to million in  due primarily to the increased revenues discussed above 
without the addition of rudolph sletten  building construction income from operations would have increased by million or due primarily to the increased volume of work in the hospitality and gaming market as a result of the significant new contract awards we received in the latter half of building construction income from operations was reduced by a million charge related to stock based compensation expense resulting from certain restricted stock units granted in civil construction income from operations increased by million or  from a loss of million in to income of million in  due primarily to the adverse impact of the wmata charge in without the wmata charge  civil construction income from operations would have decreased by million or  from million in to million in  due primarily to downward profit adjustments on several projects in the mid atlantic and southeast regions  including a roadway project in maryland 
civil construction income from operations was reduced in by a million charge related to stock based compensation expense resulting from certain restricted stock units granted in despite the decrease in revenues discussed above  management services income from operations increased by million or  from million in to million in  due primarily to favorable performance on work in iraq 
in addition  management services income from operations benefited from a million decrease in management services related general and administrative expenses  due primarily to a million decrease in stock based compensation expense resulting from the amortization of certain restricted stock awards granted in and overall income from construction operations was reduced by a million increase in corporate general and administrative expenses  from million in to million in  due primarily to a million increase in corporate stock based compensation expense resulting from the amortization of certain restricted stock units granted in and  as well as the recognition of million of expenses related to our decision to not proceed with our debt offering in the second quarter of other income expense increased by million  from income of million in to income of million in  due primarily to a million increase in interest income as a result of an increase in cash available for short term investment due largely to the cash and investments obtained in the acquisition of rudolph sletten and to the positive cash flow we generated from operating activities in the latter half of partly offsetting this increase was a million decrease in net gain recorded from the sale of certain parcels of developed land held for sale 
based on our limited remaining inventory of developed land held for sale and the anticipated potential selling prices for those parcels  we believe that the net gain recorded in is of a non recurring nature and is not indicative of expected future results 
interest expense increased by million  from million in to million in  due primarily to increased borrowings related to the million term loan received as part of the credit agreement in october  which we used to refinance a portion of the purchase price for the rudolph sletten acquisition 
the provision for income taxes increased by million  from million in to million in  due primarily to the increase in pretax income in the effective tax rate for was 
the effective tax rate for was 
results of operations compared to net income for the year ended december  was million  a million decrease from the million recorded in the net income was severely impacted by the wmata judgment discussed above which resulted in an after tax charge of million 
in addition  net income for the year ended december  reflects a lower than normal tax rate due to the realization of a portion of the federal tax benefit not recognized in prior years due to certain accounting limitations 
these negative effects on net income compared to were partly offset by profit contributions realized from the acquisitions during of both cherry hill and rudolph sletten 
on a pretax basis  earnings for the year ended december  were million  a million decrease from the then record million recorded in however  without the impact of the wmata charge  pretax earnings for would have been a record million  exceeding the record of million 
although revenues decreased by million in as the timing of new work awards was slower than anticipated  pretax earnings without the wmata charge would have increased due to the profit contributions realized from the acquisitions during of both cherry hill and rudolph sletten  as well as from improved gross margins experienced by all of our business segments in basic earnings per common share were for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  diluted earnings per common share were for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations for the year ended december  were favorably impacted by per share due to the reversal of a pro rata portion of accumulated but unpaid dividends on our preferred stock as a result of the settlement of the lawsuit brought by certain holders of our preferred stock 
revenues for the year ended december  increase decrease change in millions building   civil management services total   overall revenues decreased by million or  from  million in to  million in management services revenues decreased by million or  from million in to million in due primarily to a decreased volume of work related to the rebuilding of iraq 
building construction revenues decreased by million or  from  million in to  million in  due primarily to the timing of the start up of new work in the hospitality and gaming market as the timing of new work awards was slower than anticipated 
we received significant new awards in the hospitality and gaming market in the latter half of  however  the timing of the receipt of those new awards did not allow for a significant amount of work to be put in place during partly offsetting the overall decrease in building construction revenues was an increase of million due to the acquisition of rudolph sletten in october civil construction revenues increased by million or  from million in to million in  due to the impact of the cherry hill acquisition 
income from construction operations for the year ended december  increase decrease change in millions building civil management services subtotal less corporate total income from construction operations excluding corporate decreased by million or  from million in to million in management services income from operations decreased by million or  from million in to million in  due primarily to the decrease in revenues discussed above 
partly offsetting the negative impact of the decrease in management services revenues was a higher gross profit margin  largely due to profit increases recognized upon the completion and close out of two overseas projects 
despite the decrease in building construction revenues  building construction income from operations increased by million or  from million in to million in  due primarily to the profit contribution realized from the acquisition of rudolph sletten plus the impact of higher gross profit margins realized by all of our business units within the building construction segment largely due to profit increases recognized upon the completion and close out of several hospitality and gaming market projects 
building construction income from operations was reduced by a million increase in building construction related general and administrative expenses  due primarily to the addition of rudolph sletten in civil construction income from operations decreased by million or  from income of million in to a loss of million in  due primarily to the adverse impact of the wmata charge 
without the wmata charge  civil construction income from operations would have increased by million or  from million in to million in  due primarily to the impact of the cherry hill acquisition 
civil construction income from operations was reduced by a million increase in civil construction related general and administrative expenses due primarily to the addition of cherry hill in overall income from construction operations was reduced by a million increase in corporate general and administrative expenses  from million in to million in  due primarily to a million increase in compensation expense related to the amortization of certain restricted stock awards granted in the second half of also  corporate general and administrative expenses increased due to increased board of directors fees and directors and officers liability insurance  an increased provision for incentive compensation and increased audit fees due to our acquisitions in and to continued compliance requirements under the sarbanes oxley act of other income expense increased by million  from an expense of million in to income of million in  due primarily to a million net gain recorded from the sale of certain parcels of developed land held for sale and a million decrease in expenses related to secondary public stock offerings 
in addition  there was a million one time charge recorded in the second quarter of due to the decision to freeze all benefit accruals under our defined benefit pension plan effective june  interest expense increased by million  from million in to million in  due to interest expense on mortgage debt and equipment financing debt assumed in conjunction with the cherry hill acquisition and increased borrowings under our credit agreement to fund our acquisition of rudolph sletten 
the provision for income taxes decreased by million  from million in to million in  due primarily to the decrease in pretax income in the effective tax rate  however  more than doubled to in compared to in  due primarily to the realization in of a million federal tax benefit not recognized in prior years due to certain accounting limitations 
liquidity and capital resources cash and working capital cash and cash equivalents as reported in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows consist of amounts held by us as well as our proportionate share of amounts held by construction joint ventures 
cash held by us is available for general corporate purposes while cash held by construction joint ventures is available only for joint venture related uses 
cash held by construction joint ventures is distributed from time to time to us and to the other joint venture participants in accordance with their percentage interest after the joint venture partners determine that a cash distribution is prudent 
cash distributions received by us from our construction joint ventures are then available for general corporate purposes 
at december  and  cash held by us and available for general corporate purposes was million and million  respectively  and our proportionate share of cash held by joint ventures and available only for joint venture related uses was million and million  respectively 
billing procedures in the construction industry generally are based on the specific billing terms of a contract 
for example  billings may be based on various measures of performance  such as cubic yards excavated  architect s estimates of completion  costs incurred on cost plus type contracts or weighted progress from a cost loaded construction time schedule 
billings are generally on a monthly basis and are reviewed and approved by the customer prior to submission 
therefore  once a bill is submitted  we are generally able to collect amounts owed to us in accordance with the payment terms of the contract 
in addition  receivables of a contractor usually include retentions  or amounts that are held back until contracts are completed or until specified contract conditions or guarantees are met 
retentions are governed by contract provisions and are typically a fixed percentage for example  or of each billing 
we generally follow the policy of paying our vendors and subcontractors on a particular project after we receive payment from our customer 
a summary of cash flows for each of the years ended december   and is set forth below year ended december  in millions cash flows from operating activities investing activities financing activities net increase in cash cash at beginning of year cash at end of year during  we generated million in cash flow from operating activities to fund million in investing activities  principally to fund the purchase of construction equipment to support our substantial backlog and property to be used in support of our building construction operations  and to fund million in financing activities  primarily to redeem the remaining outstanding shares of our preferred stock  and to pay down debt assumed in conjunction with the acquisition of cherry hill 
as a result  we increased our cash balance by million during the substantial increase in cash flow from operating activities is primarily due to the substantial increase in our building segment revenues  including the acquisition of rudolph sletten  as well as favorable operating results in our management services segment 
cash flow from operating activities increased substantially even though included payment of the million wmata judgment recorded in during  we generated million in cash flow from operating activities and million in cash flow from financing activities to fund million in investing activities and to increase our cash balance by million 
cash flow from financing activities primarily reflects million in proceeds received from a new secured term loan established in conjunction with the new credit agreement that we entered into on october  cash flow from financing activities also includes a million reduction in debt  primarily to pay down a portion of the debt we assumed in conjunction with the acquisition of cherry hill  and a million expenditure for the purchase of our preferred stock pursuant to the terms of the settlement of the lawsuit brought by certain holders of our preferred stock 
cash flow used by investing activities primarily reflects the funding of the acquisitions of cherry hill in january and rudolph sletten in october for million and million  respectively  net of the cash balances acquired  as well as the purchase of construction equipment used in our operations 
proceeds from investing activities include million from the sale of certain marketable securities acquired in the purchases of cherry hill and rudolph sletten  and million from the sale of certain parcels of land 
during  we generated million in cash flow from operating activities and million in cash flow from financing activities  primarily from million received from the exercise of common stock options  to fund million in cash flow used by investing activities  primarily to purchase construction equipment  and to increase our cash balance by million 
working capital increased  from million at the end of to million at december  even though included the funding of our acquisitions of cherry hill and rudolph sletten 
the current ratio decreased from x to x during the same period 
as of december   accounts receivable amounted to million and comprised approximately of our total current assets 
this compares to accounts receivable of million  or approximately of our total current assets as of december  on february   we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with bank of america  na  as administrative agent  and three participant lenders the amended agreement 
the amended agreement amends and restates in its entirety the company s previously existing credit agreement dated as of october   as amended through april  the prior agreement 
the amended agreement provides for a secured revolving credit facility the revolving facility of up to million  which can be expanded to million in the future with the consent of the lenders 
this represents an increased borrowing capacity from the prior agreement  which provided for a revolving credit facility of million  plus a term loan in the original amount of million  of which million was outstanding at december  the term loan was paid in full on february  in conjunction with the closing of the amended agreement 
we can choose from interest rate alternatives including a prime based rate  as well as eurodollar rate based options 
while the amended agreement also provides for an increase in the aggregate amount of letters of credit that may be issued under the agreement from million to million  any outstanding letters of credit reduce availability under the revolving facility on a dollar for dollar basis 
the termination date of the revolving facility was extended from june  to february  the amended agreement requires us to comply with certain financial and other covenants at the end of each fiscal quarter  including a consolidated net worth of at least million  increased on a cumulative basis commencing with the fiscal quarter ending december   by an amount equal to of consolidated net income with no deductions for net losses for the fiscal quarter then ended plus of the amount of all equity issuances as defined in the amended agreement after february  that increase our consolidated shareholders equity  a consolidated leverage ratio of no more than to  a fixed charge coverage ratio of consolidated ebitda over covered charges which includes interest expense  cash taxes  scheduled payments of principal and interest  and current period dividends on our preferred stock of at least to  and a consolidated asset coverage ratio of at least to the amended agreement also includes operational covenants customary for facilities of this type  including limitations on incurring additional indebtedness and liens  as well as restrictions on types of investments and the purchase and sale of assets outside of the normal course of business 
our obligations under the amended agreement are guaranteed by substantially all of our current and future subsidiaries  and secured by substantially all of our and our subsidiaries assets 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any financial partnerships with unconsolidated entities  such as entities often referred to as structured finance  special purpose entities or variable interest entities which are often established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
accordingly  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had such relationships 
long term debt long term debt at december  was million  a decrease of million from december   due primarily to the reduction in the term loan that we received in october  that we used to refinance a portion of the purchase price for the rudolph sletten acquisition 
in addition  the decrease reflects a reduction in the long term debt we assumed in conjunction with the acquisition of cherry hill 
accordingly  the long term debt to equity ratio was 
x at december   compared to 
x at december  concurrently with the closing of the new credit agreement on february   we paid in full the million balance outstanding as of december  under the term loan portion of our prior credit agreement 
contractual obligations our outstanding contractual obligations as of december  are summarized in the following table payments d ue by period in th ousands less than more than total year years years years total debt  excluding interest  a  b  b  b interest payments on debt  c  operating leases  net   purchase obligations   unfunded pension liability    d  d tutor saliba management agreement total contractual obligations   a includes capital leases in the amount of b includes an amount related to the million balance outstanding on our term loan at december  which was repaid on february  in conjunction with our new credit agreement 
c includes interest payments on our variable rate term loan through february   the date of the term loan repayment in conjunction with our new credit agreement 
d assumes annual pension fund contributions equal to the contribution amount anticipated in stockholders equity our book value per common share was at december   compared to at december   and at december  the major factors impacting stockholders equity during the three year period were the net income recorded in all three years  the funding of the redemption of the preferred stock in may  the funding of the settlement of the preferred stock lawsuit in november  including the reversal of dividends million previously accrued related to the preferred stock purchased  preferred stock dividends accrued  the annual amortization of restricted stock compensation expense  and common stock options and stock purchase warrants exercised 
also  we were required to adjust our pension liability by a decrease of million in and increases of million in  million in and million in prior years  with the offset to accumulated other comprehensive loss  in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  which resulted in an aggregate million accumulated other comprehensive loss reduction in stockholders equity at december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
adjustments to the amount of this additional minimum pension liability will be recorded in future years based upon periodic re evaluation of the funded status of our pension plans 
dividends common stock there were no cash dividends declared or paid on our outstanding common stock during the three years ended december  preferred stock in november  an agreement was reached to settle a class action lawsuit filed by the holders of our preferred stock 
under the terms of the settlement  effective november   we purchased all of the  participating depositary shares that were submitted 
as a result of this transaction  approximately million of previously accrued and unpaid dividends was reversed and approximately million of that amount of previously accrued and unpaid dividends was restored to additional paid in capital in the consolidated balance sheets

sfas no 
r establishes the accounting treatment for equity instruments exchanged for employee services

from january  through december   we accounted for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no

therefore  the adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
r did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans which requires an employer to recognize the over funded or under funded status of defined benefit and other postretirement plans as an asset or liability in its balance sheet and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
as of december   as required 
since we had recognized the underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plan in previous years in accordance with sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions  and since our defined benefit pension plan was frozen in such that the projected benefit obligation equals the accumulated benefit obligation  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
in addition  sfas no 
requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its fiscal year end  with limited exceptions 
we currently use the date of our fiscal year end as our measurement date and  as a result  that new requirement did not  and will not  have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  sfas no 
which clarifies the definition of fair value  describes methods used to appropriately measure fair value  and expands fair value disclosure requirements 
sfas no 
applies under other accounting pronouncements that currently require or permit fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for us beginning january   and we will apply the provisions of sfas no 
prospectively as of that date 
we are in the process of determining the impact  if any  the adoption of sfas no 
may have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures when it become effective in in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  sab 
sab requires companies to evaluate the materiality of identified unadjusted errors in the financial statements by considering the impact of both the current year and the cumulative error  if applicable 
sab prescribes two approaches that must be used to evaluate unadjusted errors and requires the financial statements to be adjusted if either approach results in quantifying an error as material 
we adopted the provisions of sab as of december   as required 
the adoption of sab did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we are required to adopt fin as of january  fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this is different than the accounting practice that we currently follow  which is to recognize the best estimate of the impact of a tax position only when the position is probable of being sustained on audit based solely on the technical merits of the position 
the term probable is consistent with the use of the term in sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  to mean that the future event or events are likely to occur

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to borrowings under our credit agreement see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  and our short term investment portfolio 
during  we did not borrow under our revolving credit facility and we had an average balance of million outstanding on a million term loan  which was repaid in february  in conjunction with the establishment of our increased credit facility 
in addition  we had approximately million of short term investments classified as cash equivalents as of december  our revolving credit agreement is available for us to borrow  when needed  for general corporate purposes  including working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
borrowings under our credit agreement bear interest at the applicable libor or base rate  as defined  and therefore we are subject to fluctuations in interest rates 
based on our average effective borrowing rate and our average outstanding term loan balance in  a change of or basis points in our effective borrowing rate would result in an insignificant increase or decrease in net income and cash flow 
our short term investment portfolio consists of highly liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less  all classified as cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
