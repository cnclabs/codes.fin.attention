item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
factors that may affect future results company risks we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december   have a history of losses  will experience losses in the future  and may not achieve or maintain profitability 
since  we have incurred losses in every fiscal quarter 
we will need to generate significant ongoing revenue to achieve and maintain profitability 
we anticipate that our expenses will increase in the foreseeable future as we protect and enforce our intellectual property  continue to develop our technologies  attempt to expand the market for touch enabled technologies and products  increase our sales and marketing efforts  and pursue strategic relationships 
if our revenues grow more slowly than we anticipate or if our operating expenses exceed our expectations  we may not achieve or maintain profitability 
our current litigation undertakings are expensive  disruptive  and time consuming  and will continue to be  until resolved  and regardless of whether we are ultimately successful  could adversely affect our business 
we are involved in litigation with internet services llc isllc  a cross claim defendant in the lawsuit against sony computer entertainment 
isllc s appeal from the lawsuit judgment had been consolidated with sony computer entertainment s appeal of the lawsuit judgment against it at the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit 
we are also litigating a separate lawsuit involving claims for breach of contract and rescission against isllc in the us district court for the northern district of california 
in addition  we are involved in litigation with mr 
craig thorner in the us district court for the northern district of california relating to our allegations of breach of contract with respect to thorner s license to a third party of us patent no 
 and his allegations of breach of contract  breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing  promissory fraud  breach of fiduciary duty  negligent misrepresentation  and rescission 
due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation  we cannot accurately predict how these cases will ultimately be resolved 
we anticipate that the litigation will continue to be costly  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover the costs we incur in connection with the litigation 
we expense litigation costs as incurred  and only accrue for costs that have been incurred but not paid to the vendor as of the financial statement date 
the litigation has diverted  and is likely to continue to divert  the efforts and attention of some of our key management and personnel 
as a result  until such time as it is resolved  the litigation could adversely affect our business 
further  any unfavorable outcome could adversely affect our business 
for additional background on litigation  please see note to the condensed consolidated financial statements and the section titled item legal proceedings 

table of contents litigation regarding intellectual property rights could be expensive  disruptive  and time consuming  could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property  and could adversely affect our business 
intellectual property litigation  whether brought by us or by others against us  has caused us to expend  and may cause us to expend in future periods  significant financial resources as well as divert management s time and efforts 
from time to time  we initiate claims against third parties that we believe infringe our intellectual property rights 
we intend to enforce our intellectual property rights vigorously and may initiate litigation against parties that we believe are infringing our intellectual property rights if we are unable to resolve matters satisfactorily through negotiation 
litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly  time consuming  and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property 
in addition  any litigation in which we are accused of infringement may cause product shipment delays  require us to develop non infringing technologies  or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements even before the issue of infringement has been decided on the merits 
if any litigation were not resolved in our favor  we could become subject to substantial damage claims from third parties and indemnification claims from our licensees 
we and our licensees could be enjoined from the continued use of the technologies at issue without a royalty or license agreement 
royalty or license agreements  if required  might not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if a third party claiming infringement against us prevailed  and we could not develop non infringing technologies or license the infringed or similar technologies on a timely and cost effective basis  our expenses would increase and our revenues could decrease 
we attempt to avoid infringing known proprietary rights of third parties 
however  third parties may hold  or may in the future be issued  patents that could be infringed by our products or technologies 
any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us with respect to the products that we manufacture and the technologies that we license 
from time to time  we have received letters from companies  several of which have significantly greater financial resources than we do  asserting that some of our technologies  or those of our licensees  infringe their intellectual property rights 
certain of our licensees have received similar letters from these or other companies 
such letters or subsequent litigation may influence our licensees decisions whether to ship products incorporating our technologies 
in addition  such letters may cause a dispute between our licensees and us over indemnification for the infringement claim 
any of these notices  or additional notices that we or our licensees could receive in the future from these or other companies  could lead to litigation against us  either regarding the infringement claim or the indemnification claim 
we have acquired patents from third parties and also license some technologies from third parties 
we must rely upon the owners of the patents or the technologies for information on the origin and ownership of the acquired or licensed technologies 
as a result  our exposure to infringement claims may increase 
we generally obtain representations as to the origin and ownership of acquired or licensed technologies and indemnification to cover any breach of these representations 
however  representations may not be accurate and indemnification may not provide adequate compensation for breach of the representations 
intellectual property claims against our licensees  or us  whether or not they have merit  could be time consuming to defend  cause product shipment delays  require us to pay damages  harm existing license arrangements  or require us or our licensees to cease utilizing the technologies unless we can enter into licensing agreements 
licensing agreements might not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
furthermore  claims by third parties against our licensees could also result in claims by our licensees against us under the indemnification provisions of our licensees agreements with us 
the legal principles applicable to patents and patent licenses continues to change and evolve 
decisions that make it easier for patent licensees to challenge the validity  enforceability  or infringement of patents  or make it more difficult for patent licensors to obtain a permanent injunction  obtain enhanced damages for willful infringement  or to obtain or enforce patents  may adversely affect our business and the value of our patent portfolio 
furthermore  our prospects for future revenue growth through our royalty and licensing based businesses could be diminished 

table of contents the terms in our agreements may be construed by our licensees in a manner that is inconsistent with the rights that we have granted to other licensees  or in a manner that may require us to incur substantial costs to resolve conflicts over license terms 
we have entered into  and we expect to continue to enter into  agreements pursuant to which our licensees are granted rights under our technology and intellectual property 
these rights may be granted in certain fields of use  or with respect to certain market sectors or product categories  and may include exclusive rights or sublicensing rights 
we refer to the license terms and restrictions in our agreements  including  but not limited to  field of use definitions  market sector  and product category definitions  collectively as license provisions 
due to the continuing evolution of market sectors  product categories  and licensee business models  and to the compromises inherent in the drafting and negotiation of license provisions  our licensees may  at some time during the term of their agreements with us  interpret license provisions in their agreements in a way that is different from our interpretation of such license provisions  or in a way that is in conflict with the rights that we have granted to other licensees 
such interpretations by our licensees may lead to a claims that we have granted rights to one licensee which are inconsistent with the rights that we have granted to another licensee  and or b claims by one licensee against another licensee that may result in our incurring indemnification or other obligations or liabilities 
in addition  after we enter into an agreement  it is possible that markets and or products  or legal and or regulatory environments  will evolve in a manner that we did not foresee or was not foreseeable at the time we entered into the agreement 
as a result  in any agreement  we may have granted rights that will preclude or restrict our exploitation of new opportunities that arise after the execution of the agreement 
product liability claims could be time consuming and costly to defend and could expose us to loss 
our products or our licensees products may have flaws or other defects that may lead to personal or other injury claims 
if products that we or our licensees sell cause personal injury  property injury  financial loss  or other injury to our or our licensees customers  the customers or our licensees may seek damages or other recovery from us 
any claims against us would be time consuming  expensive to defend  and distracting to management  and could result in damages and injure our reputation  the reputation of our technology and services  and or the reputation of our products  or the reputation of our licensees or their products 
this damage could limit the market for our and our licensees products and harm our results of operations 
in the past  manufacturers of peripheral products including certain gaming products such as joysticks  wheels  or gamepads  have been subject to claims alleging that use of their products has caused or contributed to various types of repetitive stress injuries  including carpal tunnel syndrome 
we have not experienced any product liability claims to date 
although our license agreements typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to product liability claims  existing or future laws or unfavorable judicial decisions could limit or invalidate the provisions 
if the settlement on our current class action lawsuit falls through  the continuing lawsuit could be expensive  disruptive  and time consuming to defend against  and if we are not successful  could adversely affect our business 
we are involved in legal proceedings relating to a class action lawsuit filed on november   related to in re initial public offering securities litigation 
the named defendants are immersion and three of our current or former officers or directors and certain underwriters of our november  ipo 
subsequently  two of the individual defendants stipulated to a dismissal without prejudice 
we and most of the issuer defendants have settled with the plaintiffs 
however  the settlement requires approval by the court  which cannot be assured  after class members are given the opportunity to object to the settlement or opt out of the settlement 
if our facilities were to experience catastrophic loss  our operations would be seriously harmed 
our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss such as fire  flood  earthquake  power outage  or terrorist activity 
a substantial portion of our research and development activities  manufacturing  our corporate headquarters  and other critical business operations are located near major earthquake faults in san jose  california  an area with a history of seismic events 
an earthquake at or near our facilities could disrupt our operations  delay 
table of contents production and shipments of our products or technologies  and result in large expenses to repair and replace the facility 
while we believe that we maintain insurance sufficient to cover most long term potential losses at our facilities  our existing insurance may not be adequate for all possible losses 
in addition  california has experienced problems with its power supply in recent years 
as a result  we have experienced utility cost increases and may experience unexpected interruptions in our power supply that could have a material adverse effect on our sales  results of operations  and financial condition 
industry and technology risks we have little or no control or influence on our licensees design  manufacturing  promotion  distribution  or pricing of their products incorporating our touch enabling technologies  upon which we generate royalty revenue 
a key part of our business strategy is to license our intellectual property to companies that manufacture and sell products incorporating our touch enabling technologies 
sales of those products generate royalty and license revenue for us 
for the years ended december    and    and  respectively  of our total revenues were royalty and license revenues 
however  we do not control or influence the design  manufacture  quality control  promotion  distribution  or pricing of products that are manufactured and sold by our licensees 
in addition  we generally do not have commitments from our licensees that they will continue to use our technologies in current or future products 
as a result  products incorporating our technologies may not be brought to market  meet quality control standards  achieve commercial acceptance  or generate meaningful royalty revenue for us 
for us to generate royalty revenue  licensees that pay us per unit royalties must manufacture and distribute products incorporating our touch enabling technologies in a timely fashion and generate consumer demand through marketing and other promotional activities 
products incorporating our touch enabling technologies are generally more difficult to design and manufacture  which may cause product introduction delays or quality control problems 
if our licensees fail to stimulate and capitalize upon market demand for products that generate royalties for us  or if products are recalled because of quality control problems  our revenues will not grow and could decline 
alternatively  if a product that incorporates our touch enabling technologies achieves widespread market acceptance  the product manufacturer may elect to stop making it rather than pay us royalties based on sales of the product 
peak demand for products that incorporate our technologies  especially in the video console gaming and computer gaming peripherals market  typically occurs in the fourth calendar quarter as a result of increased demand during the year end holiday season 
if our licensees do not ship products incorporating our touch enabling technologies in a timely fashion or fail to achieve strong sales in the fourth quarter of the calendar year  we may not receive related royalty and license revenue 
most of our current gaming royalty revenues come from third party peripheral makers who make licensed gaming products designed for use with popular video game console systems from microsoft  sony  and nintendo 
video game console systems are closed  proprietary systems  and video game console system makers typically impose certain requirements or restrictions on third party peripheral makers who wish to make peripherals that will be compatible with a particular video game console system 
these requirements and restrictions could be in the form of hardware technical specifications  software technical specifications  security specifications or other security mechanisms  component vendor specifications  licensing terms and conditions  or other forms 
if third party peripheral makers cannot or are not allowed to obtain or satisfy these requirements or restrictions  our gaming royalty revenues could be significantly reduced 
furthermore  should a significant video game console maker choose to omit touch enabling capabilities from its console system or somehow restrict or impede the ability of third parties to make touch enabling peripherals  it may very well lead our gaming licensees to stop making products with touch enabling capabilities  thereby significantly reducing our gaming royalty revenues 
sony removed the vibration feature that was available on the playstation and playstation systems from the new playstation system 
this course of action by sony may have material adverse consequences on our current and future gaming royalty revenues since our gaming royalties have primarily been from licensed third party controller products with vibration or force feedback capabilities that require some degree of vibration and or force feedback support or compatibility in the video console system to be viable products 
we do not know if this situation might 
table of contents change in the life of the playstation console system  or whether or to what extent the playstation console will be compatible with third party peripherals containing force feedback capability in the future 
both the recently launched microsoft xbox and nintendo wii include touch enabling capabilities 
for the microsoft xbox video console system launched in november  microsoft has  to date  not yet broadly licensed third parties to produce peripherals for its xbox game console and has excluded third parties from producing xbox wireless controllers 
wireless game controllers account for a significant portion of our royalty revenue  including revenue from logitech and mad catz 
to the extent microsoft does not license these rights to third parties  microsoft s share of all aftermarket game controller sales will likely remain high or increase  which we expect will result in a decrease in our gaming royalty revenue 
additionally  microsoft is now making touch enabled wheels covered by their royalty free  perpetual  irrevocable license to our worldwide portfolio of patents that are in competition with our licensees products for which we earn per unit royalties 
because we have a fixed payment license with microsoft  our royalty revenue from licensing in the gaming market and other consumer markets has and may further decline if microsoft increases its volume of sales of touch enabled gaming products and consumer products at the expense of our other licensees 
under the terms of our present agreement with microsoft  microsoft receives a royalty free  perpetual  irrevocable license to our worldwide portfolio of patents 
this license permits microsoft to make  use  and sell hardware  software  and services  excluding specified products  covered by our patents 
we also granted to microsoft a limited right  under our patents relating to touch technologies  to sublicense specified rights  excluding rights to excluded products and peripheral devices  to third party customers of microsoft s or microsoft s subsidiaries products other than sony corporation  sony computer entertainment inc  sony computer entertainment of america inc  and their subsidiaries 
in exchange  for the grant of these rights and the rights included in a separate sublicense agreement  microsoft paid us a one time payment of million 
we will not receive any further revenues or royalties from microsoft under our current agreement with microsoft 
microsoft has a significant share of the market for touch enabled console gaming computer peripherals and is pursuing other consumer markets such as mobile phones  pdas  and portable music players microsoft has significantly greater financial  sales  and marketing resources  as well as greater name recognition and a larger customer base than some of our other licensees 
in the event that microsoft increases its share of these markets  our royalty revenue from other licensees in these market segments might decline 
we generate revenues from touch enabling components that are sold and incorporated into third party products 
we have little or no control or influence over the design  manufacturing  promotion  distribution  or pricing of those third party products 
part of our business strategy is to sell components that provide touch feedback capability in products that other companies design  manufacture  and sell 
sales of these components generate product revenue 
however  we do not control or influence the design  manufacture  quality control  promotion  distribution  or pricing of products that are manufactured and sold by those customers that buy these components 
in addition  we generally do not have commitments from customers that they will continue to use our components in current or future products 
as a result  products incorporating our components may not be brought to market  meet quality control standards  or achieve commercial acceptance 
if the customers fail to stimulate and capitalize upon market demand for their products that include our components  or if products are recalled because of quality control problems  our revenues will not grow and could decline 
medtronic accounts for a significant portion of our revenues and a reduction in sales to medtronic  or a reduction in development work for medtronic  may reduce our total revenue 
medtronic accounts for a significant portion of our revenue 
for the years ended december    and    and  respectively  of our total revenues were derived from medtronic 
if our product sales to medtronic decline  and or medtronic reduces the development activities we perform  then our total revenue may decline 

table of contents logitech accounts for a significant portion of our revenue and the failure of logitech to achieve sales volumes for its gaming peripheral products that incorporate our touch enabling technologies may reduce our total revenue 
logitech accounts for a significant portion of our revenue 
logitech is a supplier of aftermarket game console controllers  joysticks  and steering wheels  many of which incorporate our technology 
in the past  during transitions to next generation console systems  sales of aftermarket game console controllers have dropped significantly  reducing licensing royalties we earn 
the gaming industry is currently transitioning to the latest next generation console systems  and we have experienced a significant decline in revenues we earn from logitech since this transition commenced 
for the years ended december    and    and  respectively  of our total revenues were derived from logitech 
revenues from logitech may decline further if its aftermarket game console peripheral sales decline further  or if it is unable to obtain or expand its license rights to sell touch enabled controllers  steering wheels  or joysticks for the sony playstation  the nintendo wii  or the microsoft xbox also  competition with microsoft may dampen demand for logitech products 
any decrease in sales of aftermarket peripherals that include our technology by logitech will reduce our gaming royalty revenues 
sony s decision not to include certain vibration features in the playstation system may significantly adversely affect logitech s ability or desire to include our technologies in products compatible with the playstation  which in return may materially adversely affect our royalty revenue from logitech 
touch interface product royalties will be reduced if bmw were to abandon its idrive system or remove our technology from the idrive 
our largest royalty stream from touch interface products is currently from bmw for its idrive controller 
press reviews of this system have been largely negative and critical of the system s complex user interface  which we did not design 
nevertheless  this negative press may cause bmw to abandon the idrive controller or to redesign it and or remove our technology from it at any time 
if our technology is not incorporated in the bmw vehicles our business may suffer 
we depend on third party suppliers  and our revenue and or results of operations could suffer if we fail to manage supplier issues properly 
our operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components and products for a wide variety of systems  products  and services  and on our suppliers ability to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components  products  and services at reasonable prices in time for us to meet critical schedules 
we may experience a shortage of  or a delay in receiving  certain supplies as a result of strong demand  capacity constraints  supplier financial weaknesses  disputes with suppliers  other problems experienced by suppliers  or problems faced during the transition to new suppliers 
if shortages or delays persist  the price of these supplies may increase  we may be exposed to quality issues  or the supplies may not be available at all 
we may not be able to secure enough supplies at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build products or provide services in a timely manner in the quantities or according to the specifications needed 
we could lose time sensitive sales  incur additional freight costs  or be unable to pass on price increases to our customers 
if we cannot adequately address supply issues  we might have to reengineer some products or service offerings  resulting in further costs and delays 
we intend to purchase certain products from a limited source in china 
if the supply of these products were to be delayed or constrained  or of insufficient quality  we may be unable to find a new supplier on acceptable terms  or at all  or our ability to ship these new products could be delayed  any of which could harm our business  financial condition  and operating results 
additionally  our use of single source suppliers for certain components could exacerbate our supplier issues 
we obtain a significant number of components from single sources due to technology  availability  price  quality  or other considerations 
in addition  new products that we introduce may use custom components obtained from only one source initially  until we have evaluated whether there is a need for additional suppliers 
the performance of such single source suppliers may affect the quality  quantity  and price of supplies to us 
accordingly  our revenue and or results of operations could be adversely impacted by such events 

table of contents compliance with new directives that restrict the use of certain materials may increase our costs and limit our revenue opportunities 
on july   the european union s rohs directive became effective 
this directive eliminates most uses of lead  cadmium  hexavalent chromium  mercury  and certain fire retardants in electronics placed on the market after the effective date 
since the introduction of the european union s rohs directive  other regions of the world have announced or implemented similar regulations 
in order to sell products into regions that adopt these or similar regulations  we have to assess each product and determine whether they comply with the requirements of the regulations or whether they are exempt from meeting the requirements of the regulations 
if we determine that a product is not exempt and does not comply with adopted regulations  we will have to make changes to the product or its documentation if we want to sell that product into the region once the regulations become effective 
making such changes may be costly to perform and may have a negative impact on our results of operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the national enforcement bodies of the regions adopting such regulations will agree with our assessment that certain of our products and documentation comply with or are exempt from the regulations 
if products are determined not to be compliant or exempt  we will not be able to ship them in the region that adopts such regulations until such time that they are compliant  and this may have a negative impact on our revenue and results of operations 
because personal computer peripheral products that incorporate our touch enabling technologies currently must work with microsoft s operating system software  our costs could increase and our revenues could decline if microsoft modifies its operating system software 
our hardware and software technologies for personal computer peripheral products that incorporate our touch enabling technologies are currently compatible with microsoft s windows  windows me  and windows xp operating systems  including directx  microsoft s entertainment api 
modifications and new versions of microsoft s operating system and apis including directx and the windows vista launched in early may require that we and or our licensees modify the touch enabling technologies to be compatible with microsoft s modifications or new versions  and this could cause delays in the release of products by our licensees 
if microsoft modifies its software products in ways that limit the use of our other licensees products  our costs could increase and our revenues could decline 
reduced spending by corporate or university research and development departments may adversely affect sales of our three dimensional products 
any economic downturn could lead to a reduction in corporate or university budgets for research and development in sectors  including the automotive and aerospace sectors  which use our three dimensional and professional products 
sales of our three dimensional and professional products  including our cyberglove line of whole hand sensing gloves and our microscribe line of digitizers  could be adversely affected by cuts in corporate research and development budgets 
competition between our products and our licensees products may reduce our revenue 
rapid technological change  short product life cycles  cyclical market patterns  declining average selling prices  and increasing foreign and domestic competition characterize the markets in which we and our licensees compete 
we believe that competition in these markets will continue to be intense and that competitive pressures will drive the price of our products and our licensees products downward 
these price reductions  if not offset by increases in unit sales or productivity  will cause our revenues to decline 
we face competition from unlicensed products as well 
our licensees or other third parties may seek to develop products using our intellectual property or develop alternative designs that attempt to circumvent our intellectual property  which they believe do not require a license under our intellectual property 
these potential competitors may have significantly greater financial  technical  and marketing resources than we do  and the costs associated with asserting our intellectual property rights against such products and such potential competitors could be significant 
moreover  if such alternative designs were determined by a court not to require a license under our intellectual property rights  competition from such unlicensed products could limit or reduce our revenues 

table of contents we have experienced significant change in our business  and our failure to manage the complexities associated with the changing economic environment and technology landscape could harm our business 
any future periods of rapid economic and technological change may place significant strains on our managerial  financial  engineering  and other resources 
our failure to effectively manage these resources during periods of rapid economic or technological change may harm our business 
the market for certain touch enabling technologies and touch enabled products is at an early stage and if market demand does not develop  we may not achieve or sustain revenue growth 
the market for certain of our touch enabling technologies and certain of our licensees touch enabled products is at an early stage 
if we and our licensees are unable to develop demand for touch enabling technologies and touch enabled products  we may not achieve or sustain revenue growth 
we cannot accurately predict the growth of the markets for these technologies and products  the timing of product introductions  or the timing of commercial acceptance of these products 
even if our touch enabling technologies and our licensees touch enabled products are ultimately widely adopted  widespread adoption may take a long time to occur 
the timing and amount of royalties and product sales that we receive will depend on whether the products marketed achieve widespread adoption and  if so  how rapidly that adoption occurs 
we expect that we will need to pursue extensive and expensive marketing and sales efforts to educate prospective licensees  component customers  and end users about the uses and benefits of our technologies and to persuade software developers to create software that utilizes our technologies 
negative product reviews or publicity about our products  our licensees products  haptic features  or haptic technology in general could have a negative impact on market adoption  our revenue  and or our ability to license our technologies in the future 
if we fail to increase sales of our medical simulation devices  our financial condition and operations may suffer 
many medical institutions do not budget for simulation devices 
to increase sales of our simulation devices  we must  in addition to convincing medical institution personnel of the usefulness of the devices  persuade them to include a significant expenditure for the devices in their budgets 
if these medical institutions are unwilling to budget for simulation devices or reduce their budgets as a result of cost containment pressures or other factors  we may not be able to increase or maintain sales of medical simulators at a satisfactory rate 
a decrease in sales or any failure to increase sales of our medical simulation products will harm our business 
if we are unable to enter into new licensing arrangements with our existing licensees  and with additional third party manufacturers for our touch enabling technologies  our royalty revenue may not grow 
our revenue growth is significantly dependent on our ability to enter into new licensing arrangements 
our failure to enter into new or renewal of licensing arrangements will cause our operating results to suffer 
we face numerous risks in obtaining new licenses on terms consistent with our business objectives and in maintaining  expanding  and supporting our relationships with our current licensees 
these risks include the lengthy and expensive process of building a relationship with potential licensees  the fact that we may compete with the internal design teams of existing and potential licensees  difficulties in persuading product manufacturers to work with us  to rely on us for critical technology  and to disclose to us proprietary product development and other strategies  difficulties with persuading potential licensees who may have developed their own intellectual property or licensed intellectual property from other parties in areas related to ours to license our technology versus continuing to develop their own or license from other parties  challenges in demonstrating the compelling value of our technologies in new applications like mobile phones  portable devices  and touchscreens  
table of contents difficulties in persuading existing and potential licensees to bear the development costs and risks necessary to incorporate our technologies into their products  difficulties in obtaining new automotive licensees for yet to be commercialized technology because their suppliers may not be ready to meet stringent quality and parts availability requirements  inability to sign new gaming licensees if the video console makers choose not to license third parties to make peripherals for their new consoles  difficulty in signing new gaming licensees given the fact that sony has not included vibration features in the playstation or related products  and reluctance of content developers  mobile phone manufacturers  and service providers to sign license agreements without a critical mass of other such inter dependent supporters of the mobile phone industry also having a license  or without enough phones in the market that incorporate our technologies 
a majority of our current royalty revenue has been derived from the licensing of our portfolio of touch enabling technologies for video game console and personal computer gaming peripherals  such as gamepads  joysticks  and steering wheels 
though substantially smaller than the market for dedicated gaming console peripherals  the market for gamepads  joysticks  and steering wheels for use with personal computers is declining and is characterized by declining average selling prices 
if the console peripheral market also experiences declines in sales and selling prices  we may not achieve royalty revenue growth 
if we fail to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights  our ability to license our technologies and generate revenues would be impaired 
our business depends on generating revenues by licensing our intellectual property rights and by selling products that incorporate our technologies 
we rely on our significant patent portfolio to protect our proprietary rights 
if we are not able to protect and enforce those rights  our ability to obtain future licenses or maintain current licenses and royalty revenue could be impaired 
in addition  if a court or the patent office were to limit the scope  declare unenforceable  or invalidate any of our patents  current licensees may refuse to make royalty payments  or they may choose to challenge one or more of our patents 
it is also possible that our pending patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents  our patents may not be broad enough to protect our proprietary rights  and effective patent protection may not be available in every country in which we or our licensees do business 
we also rely on licenses  confidentiality agreements  other contractual agreements  and copyright  trademark  and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
it is possible that laws and contractual restrictions may not be sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our technologies or deter others from developing similar technologies  and policing unauthorized use of our patented technologies  trademarks  and other proprietary rights would be difficult  expensive  and time consuming  particularly outside of the united states of america 
certain terms or rights granted in our license agreements or our development contracts may limit our future revenue opportunities 
while it is not our general practice to sign license agreements that provide exclusive rights for a period of time with respect to a technology  field of use  and or geography  or to accept similar limitations in product development contracts  we have entered into such agreements and may in the future 
although additional compensation or other benefits may be part of the agreement  the compensation or benefits may not adequately compensate us for the limitations or restrictions we have agreed to as that particular market develops 
over the life of the exclusivity period  especially in markets that grow larger or faster than anticipated  our revenue may be limited and less than what we could have achieved in the market with several licensees or additional products available to sell to a specific set of customers 

table of contents if we are unable to continually improve and reduce the cost of our technologies  companies may not incorporate our technologies into their products  which could impair our revenue growth 
our ability to achieve revenue growth depends on our continuing ability to improve and reduce the cost of our technologies and to introduce these technologies to the marketplace in a timely manner 
if our development efforts are not successful or are significantly delayed  companies may not incorporate our technologies into their products and our revenue growth may be impaired 
if we fail to develop new or enhanced technologies for new applications and platforms  we may not be able to create a market for our technologies or our technologies may become obsolete  and our ability to grow and our results of operations might be harmed 
our initiatives to develop new and enhanced technologies and to commercialize these technologies for new applications and new platforms may not be successful 
any new or enhanced technologies may not be favorably received by consumers and could damage our reputation or our brand 
expanding our technologies could also require significant additional expenses and strain our management  financial  and operational resources 
moreover  technology products generally have relatively short product life cycles and our current products may become obsolete in the future 
our ability to generate revenues will be harmed if we fail to develop new technologies or products  the technologies we develop infringe on third party patents or other third party rights  our new technologies fail to gain market acceptance  or our current products become obsolete or no longer meet new regulatory requirements 
we have limited engineering  quality assurance and manufacturing resources to design and fulfill timely product deliverables and deliver sufficient levels of quality in support of our different product areas 
products and services may not be delivered in a timely way  with sufficient levels of quality  or at all  which may reduce our revenue 
engineering  quality assurance  and manufacturing resources are deployed against a variety of different projects and programs to provide sufficient levels of quality necessary for channels and customers 
success in various markets may depend on timely deliveries and overall levels of sustained quality 
failure to provide product and program deliverables and quality levels in a timely way  or at all  may disrupt channels and customers and reduce our revenues 
the higher cost of products incorporating our touch enabling technologies may inhibit or prevent their widespread adoption 
personal computer and console gaming peripherals  mobile phones  touchscreens  and automotive and industrial controls incorporating our touch enabling technologies can be more expensive than similar competitive products that are not touch enabled 
although major manufacturers  such as alps electric co  bmw  lg electronics  logitech  microsoft  and samsung have licensed our technologies  the greater expense of development and production of products containing our touch enabling technologies may be a significant barrier to their widespread adoption and sale 
third party validation studies may not demonstrate all the benefits of our medical training simulators  which could affect customer motivation to buy 
in medical training  validation studies are generally used to confirm the usefulness of new techniques  devices  and training methods 
for medical training simulators  several levels of validation are generally tested content  concurrent  construct  and predictive 
a validation study performed by a third party  such as a hospital  a teaching institution  or even an individual healthcare professional  could result in showing little or no benefit for one or more types of validation for our medical training simulators 
such validation study results published in medical journals could impact the willingness of customers to buy our training simulators  especially new simulators that have not 
table of contents previously been validated 
due to the time generally required to complete and publish additional validation studies usually more than a year  the negative impact on sales revenue could be significant 
medical licensing and certification authorities may not recommend or require use of our technologies for training and or testing purposes  significantly slowing or inhibiting the market penetration of our medical simulation technologies 
several key medical certification bodies  including the american board of internal medicine abim and the american college of cardiology acc  have great influence in recommending particular medical methodologies  including medical training and testing methodologies  for use by medical professionals 
in the event that the abim and the acc  as well as other  similar bodies  do not endorse medical simulation products in general  or our products in particular  as a training and or testing tool  market penetration for our products could be significantly and adversely affected 
we have limited distribution channels and resources to market and sell our medical simulators  touch interface products  and three dimensional simulation and digitizing products  and if we are unsuccessful in marketing and selling these products  we may not achieve or sustain product revenue growth 
we have limited resources for marketing and selling medical simulation  touch interface  or three dimensional simulation and digitizing products  either directly or through distributors 
to achieve our business objectives  we must build a balanced mixture of sales through a direct sales channel and through qualified distribution channels 
the success of our efforts to sell medical simulation  touch interface  and three dimensional simulation products will depend upon our ability to retain and develop a qualified sales force and effective distribution channels 
we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel necessary to sell and market our products 
a number of our distributors represent small  specialized companies and may not have sufficient capital or human resources to support the complexities of selling and supporting our products 
there can be no assurance that our direct selling efforts will be effective  distributors or oems will market our products successfully or  if our relationships with distributors or oems terminate  that we will be able to establish relationships with other distributors or oems on satisfactory terms  if at all 
any disruption in the distribution  sales  or marketing network for our products could have a material adverse effect on our product revenues 
competition in the medical market may reduce our revenue 
if the medical simulation market develops as we anticipate  we believe that we will have increased competition 
as in many developing markets  acquisitions  or consolidations may occur that could lead to larger competitors with more resources or broader market penetration 
this increased competition may result in the decline of our revenue and may cause us to reduce our selling prices 
competition in the mobility or touchscreen markets may increase our costs and reduce our revenue 
if the mobility or touchscreen markets develop as we anticipate  we believe that we will face a greater number of competitors  possibly including the internal design teams of existing and potential oem customers 
these potential competitors may have significantly greater financial and technical resources than we do  and the costs associated with competing with such potential competitors could be significant 
additionally  increased competition may result in the reduction of our market share and or cause us to reduce our prices  which may result in a decline in our revenue 
automobiles incorporating our touch enabling technologies are subject to lengthy product development periods  making it difficult to predict when and whether we will receive per unit automotive royalties 
the product development process for automobiles is very lengthy  sometimes longer than four years 
we do not earn per unit royalty revenue on our automotive technologies unless and until automobiles featuring our technologies are shipped to customers  which may not occur until several years after we enter into an agreement with an automobile manufacturer or a supplier to an automobile manufacturer 
throughout the product development process  we face the risk that an automobile manufacturer or supplier may delay the incorporation of  or 
table of contents choose not to incorporate  our technologies into its automobiles  making it difficult for us to predict the per unit automotive royalties we may receive  if any 
after the product launches  our royalties still depend on market acceptance of the vehicle or the option packages if our technology is an option for example  a navigation unit  which is likely to be determined by many factors beyond our control 
we might be unable to retain or recruit necessary personnel  which could slow the development and deployment of our technologies 
our ability to develop and deploy our technologies and to sustain our revenue growth depends upon the continued service of our management and other key personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
management and other key employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time upon short notice 
the loss of management or key personnel could delay product development cycles or otherwise harm our business 
we believe that our future success will also depend largely on our ability to attract  integrate  and retain sales  support  marketing  and research and development personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and we may not be successful in attracting  integrating  and retaining such personnel 
given the protracted nature of if  how  and when we collect royalties on new design contracts  it may be difficult to craft compensation plans that will attract and retain the level of salesmanship needed to secure these contracts 
our stock option program is a long term retention program that is intended to attract  retain  and provide incentives for talented employees  officers and directors  and to align stockholder and employee interests 
our stock option plan expires in june of the adoption of a new stock plan requires stockholder approval 
additionally some of our executive officers and key employees hold stock options with exercise prices considerably above the current market price of our common stock 
each of these factors may impair our ability to retain the services of our executive officers and key employees 
our technologies are complex and we rely upon the continued service of our existing engineering personnel to support licensees  enhance existing technologies  and develop new technologies 
investment risks our convertible debentures provide for various events of default and change of control transactions that would entitle the selling stockholders to require us to repay the entire amount owed in cash 
if an event of default or change of control occurs  we may be unable to immediately repay the amount owed  and any repayment may leave us with little or no working capital in our business 
our convertible debentures provide for various events of default  such as the termination of trading of our common stock on the nasdaq global market and specified change of control transactions 
if an event of default or change of control occurs prior to maturity  we may be required to redeem all or part of the convertible debentures  including payment of applicable interest and penalties 
some of the events of default include matters over which we may have some  little  or no control 
many other events of default are described in the agreements we executed when we issued the convertible debentures 
if an event of default or a change of control occurs  we may be required to repay the entire amount  plus liquidated damages  in cash 
any such repayment could leave us with little or no working capital for our business 
we have not established a sinking fund for payment of our outstanding convertible debentures  nor do we anticipate doing so 
our quarterly revenues and operating results are volatile  and if our future results are below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  the price of our common stock is likely to decline 
our revenues and operating results are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control and any of which could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
these factors include the establishment or loss of licensing relationships  the timing and recognition of payments under fixed and or up front license agreements  
table of contents the timing of work performed under development agreements  the timing of our expenses  including costs related to litigation  stock based awards  acquisitions of technologies  or businesses  the timing of introductions and market acceptance of new products and product enhancements by us  our licensees  our competitors  or their competitors  our ability to develop and improve our technologies  our ability to attract  integrate  and retain qualified personnel  and seasonality in the demand for our products or our licensees products 
our stock price may fluctuate regardless of our performance 
the stock market has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to the performance of particular companies 
these market fluctuations may cause our stock price to decline regardless of our performance 
the market price of our common stock has been  and in the future could be  significantly affected by factors such as actual or anticipated fluctuations in operating results  announcements of technical innovations  announcements regarding litigation in which we are involved  changes by game console manufacturers to not include touch enabling capabilities in their products  new products or new contracts  sales or the perception in the market of possible sales of large number of shares of our common stock by insiders or others  changes in securities analysts recommendations  changing circumstances regarding competitors or their customers  governmental regulatory action  developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights  inclusion in or exclusion from various stock indices  and general market conditions 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has been initiated against that company  such as the suit currently pending against us 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control  which could reduce the market price of our common stock 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management 
in addition  certain provisions of delaware law may discourage  delay  or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us 
these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares 
issuance of the shares of common stock upon conversion of debentures  exercise of stock options  and exercise of warrants will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the issuance of shares of common stock in the following circumstances will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders i upon conversion of some or all of the convertible debentures ii upon exercise of some or all of the stock options  and iii upon exercise of some or all of the warrants 
any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion or upon such exercises  respectively  could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 
in addition  the existence of these convertible debentures  stock options  and warrants may encourage short selling by market participants 
our major stockholders retain significant control over us  which may lead to conflicts with other stockholders over corporate governance matters and could also affect the volatility of our stock price 
we currently have  have had in the past  and may have in the future  stockholders who retain greater than  or in some cases greater than  of our outstanding stock 
acting together  these stockholders would be able to exercise significant influence over matters that our stockholders vote upon  including the election of directors and mergers or other business combinations  which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control over or merging with us 
further  if any individuals in this group elect to sell a significant portion or all of their holdings of our common stock  the trading price of our common stock could experience volatility 

table of contents we may engage in acquisitions that could dilute stockholders interests  divert management attention  or cause integration problems 
as part of our business strategy  we have in the past and may in the future  acquire businesses or intellectual property that we feel could complement our business  enhance our technical capabilities  or increase our intellectual property portfolio 
if we consummate acquisitions through cash and or an exchange of our securities  our stockholders could suffer significant dilution 
acquisitions could also create risks for us  including unanticipated costs associated with the acquisitions  use of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the acquisitions  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  difficulties in assimilation of acquired personnel or operations  and potential intellectual property infringement claims related to newly acquired product lines 
any acquisitions  even if successfully completed  might not generate significant additional revenue or provide any benefit to our business 
if we fail to comply with nasdaq stock market maintenance criteria for continued listing on the nasdaq global market  our common stock could be delisted 
to maintain the listing of our common stock on the nasdaq global market  we are required to comply with one of two sets of maintenance criteria for continued listing 
under the first set of criteria  among other things  we must maintain stockholders equity of at least million  the market value of our publicly held common stock excluding shares held by our affiliates must be at least million  and the minimum bid price for our common stock must be at least per share 
under the second set of criteria  among other things  the market value of our common stock must be at least million or we must have both million in assets and million in revenues  the market value of our publicly held shares must be at least million  and the minimum bid price for our common stock must be at least per share 
as of december   our most recent balance sheet date  we had a deficit in stockholders equity  and therefore would not have been in compliance with the first set of listing criteria as of that date 
although we were in compliance with the second set of criteria  should the price of our common stock decline to the point where the aggregate value of our outstanding common stock falls below million  the value of our publicly held shares falls below million  or the bid price of our common stock falls below per share  our shares could be delisted from the nasdaq global market 
if we are unable to comply with the applicable criteria and our common stock is delisted from the nasdaq global market  it would likely be more difficult to affect trades and to determine the market price of our common stock 
in addition  delisting of our common stock could materially affect the market price and liquidity of our common stock and our future ability to raise necessary capital 
failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 
if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  as standards are modified  supplemented  or amended from time to time  we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
failure to maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 
legislative actions  higher insurance cost  and potential new accounting pronouncements are likely to impact our future financial position and results of operations 
there have been regulatory changes and new accounting pronouncements including the sarbanes oxley act of  and the recently enacted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised sfas no 
r  share based payment  which have had an effect on our financial position and results of operations 
under sfas no 
r  we have been required since january   to adopt a different method of 
table of contents determining the compensation expense of our employee stock options 
sfas no 
r has had a significant adverse effect on our reported financial conditions and may impact the way we conduct our business 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin clarifies the application of statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  sfas no 
by defining criteria that must be met for any part of a benefit related to an individual tax position to be recognized in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on measurement  derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition and is effective for us beginning january  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of fin will have on our financial position and results of operations 
there may potentially be new accounting pronouncements or additional regulatory rulings that also have an impact on our future financial position and results of operations 
these and other potential changes could materially increase the expenses we report under generally accepted accounting principles  and adversely affect our operating results

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  stock based compensation  bad debts  inventory reserves  warranty obligations  patents and intangible assets  contingencies  and litigation 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions

revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or service has been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
we derive our revenues from three principal sources royalty and license fees  product sales  and development contracts 
royalty and license revenue we recognize royalty and license revenue based on royalty reports or related information received from the licensee as well as time based licenses of our intellectual property portfolio 
up front payments under license agreements are deferred and recognized as revenue based on either the royalty reports received or amortized over the license period depending on the nature of the agreement 
advance payments under license agreements that also require us to provide future services to the licensee are deferred and recognized over the service period when vendor specific objective evidence vsoe related to the value of the services does not exist 
we generally recognize revenue from our licensees under one or a combination of the following license models license revenue model revenue recognition perpetual license of intellectual property portfolio based on per unit royalties  no services contracted 
based on royalty reports received from licensees 
no further obligations to licensee exist 
time based license of intellectual property portfolio with up front payments and or annual minimum royalty requirements  no services contracted

 and sop  as amended  to guide the accounting treatment for each individual contract 
see also the discussions regarding multiple element arrangements below 
if the information received from our licensees regarding royalties is incorrect or inaccurate  our revenues in future periods may be adversely affected 
to date  none of the information we have received from our licensees has caused any material reduction in future period revenues 
product sales we recognize revenues from product sales when the product is shipped  provided collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligation remains 
we sell the majority of our products with warranties ranging from three to twenty four months 
we record the estimated warranty costs during the quarter the revenue is recognized 
historically  warranty related costs and related accruals have not been significant 
we offer a general right of return on the microscribe product line for days after purchase 
we recognize revenue at the time of shipment of a microscribe digitizer and provide an accrual for potential returns based on historical experience 
we offer no other general right of return on our products 

table of contents development contracts and other revenue development contracts and other revenue is comprised of professional services consulting services and or development contracts  customer support  and extended warranty contracts 
development contract revenues are recognized under the cost to cost percentage of completion accounting method based on physical completion of the work to be performed 
losses on contracts are recognized when determined 
revisions in estimates are reflected in the period in which the conditions become known 
customer support and extended warranty contract revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual period 
multiple element arrangements we enter into revenue arrangements in which the customer purchases a combination of patent  technology  and or software licenses  products  professional services  support  and extended warranties multiple element arrangements 
when vsoe of fair value exists for all elements  we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative fair value of each of the elements 
our revenue recognition policies are significant because our revenues are a key component of our results of operations 
in addition  our revenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses  such as commissions and royalties 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in greater or future operating losses 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r on january  we elected the modified prospective method  under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
valuation and amortization method we use the black scholes merton option pricing model black scholes model  single option approach to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares 
all share based payment awards are amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  risk free interest rate  and expected dividends 
expected term we estimate the expected term of options granted by using the simplified method as prescribed by sab no 
expected volatility we estimate the volatility of our common stock taking into consideration our historical stock price movement  the volatility of stock prices of companies of similar size with similar businesses  if any  and our expected future stock price trends based on known or anticipated events 
risk free interest rate we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the option pricing model on us treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options 
expected dividend we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
forfeitures we are required to estimate future forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
changes in estimated forfeitures will be recognized through a cumulative catch up adjustment in the period of change and will also impact the amount of compensation expense to be recognized in future periods 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating results 

table of contents the black scholes model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable  characteristics not present in our option grants and employee stock purchase plan shares 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes and lattice binomial models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination  or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future 
certain stock based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire and be worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that are significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
there currently is no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values

long term liabilities in  we executed a series of agreements with microsoft as described in note to the consolidated financial statements that provided for settlement of our lawsuit against microsoft as well as various licensing  sublicensing  and equity and financing arrangements 
we accounted for the proceeds received under the agreements as a long term customer advance based on certain provisions that would result in payment of funds to microsoft 
upon microsoft s election to convert its shares of our series a preferred stock into common stock  we reduced the long term customer advance from microsoft to the minimum amount we would be obligated to pay microsoft upon a settlement with sony computer entertainment 
the remainder of the consideration was transferred to common stock in under a settlement with sony computer entertainment  we would be obligated to pay microsoft a minimum of million for any amounts received from sony up to million  plus of any amounts over million up to million  and of any amounts over million 
we believe that we are not obligated under our agreements with microsoft to make any payment to microsoft relating to the conclusion of our patent litigation with sony computer entertainment 
however  it is uncertain that microsoft will accept our position or that we will ultimately prevail with our position 
in december  we executed a series of agreements as described in note to the consolidated financial statements that provided for the issuance of senior subordinated convertible debentures convertible debenture  and warrants  and that granted certain registration rights to the holders of the convertible debentures 
we accounted for the issuance of our convertible debentures and related warrants in accordance with eitf no 
 accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios and other related accounting guidance 
we estimated the relative fair value of the various instruments included in the agreements entered into in december and allocated the relative fair values to be as follows warrants million  put option million  registration rights million  issuance costs million  convertible debentures million 
the convertible debentures are being accreted to million over their five year life  resulting in additional interest expense 
the value of the warrants is included in stockholders deficit  the value of the put option and registration rights are recorded as liabilities and are subject to future value adjustments  and the value of the convertible debentures is recorded as long term debt 
long term deferred revenue in addition to normal items of deferred revenue due after one year  we have included sony computer entertainment compulsory license fees and interest earned thereon in long term deferred revenue due to the contingent nature of the court ordered payments see note to the consolidated financial statements 
upon the conclusion of our patent litigation at the us court of appeals for the federal circuit the contingency on these funds has lapsed 
we are currently evaluating the impact of this on our consolidated statement of operations and consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents recovery of accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our review and assessment of our customers ability to make required payments 
if the financial condition of one or more of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
to date such estimated losses have been within our expectations 
inventory reserves we reduce our inventory value for estimated obsolete and slow moving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
product return and warranty reserves we provide for estimated costs of future anticipated product returns and warranty obligations based on historical experience when related revenues are recognized  and we defer warranty related revenue over the related warranty term 
intangible assets we have acquired patents and other intangibles 
in addition  we capitalize the external legal and filing fees associated with patents and trademarks 
we assess the recoverability of our intangible assets  and we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets that affect our consolidated financial statements 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
we amortize our intangible assets related to patents and trademarks  once they issue  over their estimated useful lives  generally years 
future changes in the estimated useful life could affect the amount of future period amortization expense that we will incur 
during  we capitalized costs associated with patents and trademarks of million 
our total amortization expense for the same period for all intangible assets was the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 

table of contents results of operations overview of during  we achieved several milestones  including growth in all of our key market areas  except gaming 
this growth was due  in part  to changing our medical business to a product sales based business model and our continued investment in a strengthened and more focused sales and marketing effort across our business segments 
in addition  as market acceptance of medical simulation has increased  our medical product sales grew in over the year ended december  and accounted for of total immersion medical revenue for the year 
this growth is also a result of increases in business with medtronic and laerdal  and the release of new products and modules 
in  we signed a new handset licensee  lg electronics 
in addition  we saw the first commercial shipment of a vibetonz enabled touchscreen phone during the fourth quarter of revenue for the touch interface product business grew in over the year ended december  it is expected that m touch systems will integrate our touchsense system into its touchscreens and market and sell the resulting product to manufacturers of casino gaming and bar top amusement equipment 
we announced that we had settled our legal differences with electro source llc electro source and granted them a worldwide license to our patents for vibro tactile devices in the consumer gaming peripheral field of use 
in exchange for the license electro source will make royalty payments to us based on sales by electro source of spinning mass vibro tactile gamepads  steering wheels  and other game controllers for dedicated gaming consoles  such as the sony playstation and playstation  the nintendo gamecube  and the microsoft xbox and xbox additionally  payments of million were made to us during and classified as litigation settlement 
in  we expect to continue to focus on the execution of sales and marketing plans in our established businesses to increase revenue and make selected investments in product and technology development for longer term new growth areas 
we expect litigation expenses to continue to be significant in and have budgeted to continue to protect and defend our extensive intellectual property portfolio across all business segments 
our success could be limited by several factors  including the timely release of our new products or our licensees products  continued market acceptance of our products and technology  the introduction of new products by existing or new competitors  and the cost of ongoing litigation 
for a further discussion of these and other risk factors  see item a risk factors

our total revenue for the year ended december  increased by million or to million from million in royalty and license revenue 
royalty and license revenue is comprised of royalties earned on sales by our licensees and license fees charged for our intellectual property portfolio 
royalty and license revenue decreased by million or from to the decrease in royalty and license revenue was primarily a result of a decrease in gaming royalties of million  a decrease in medical royalties and licensee revenue of  offset in part by an increase in touch interface product royalties of  and an increase in mobility royalties and license revenue of  
table of contents the decrease in gaming royalties was mainly due to decreased sales by our licensees of royalty bearing gaming peripherals 
this decrease in sales was primarily due to i the continued decline in sales of past generation video console systems with the recent launches of the next generation console models from sony playstation and nintendo wii  and ii the significant decline in third party market share of aftermarket game console controllers as market share shifted to first party peripheral makers due to the launch of the next generation console models 
sony announced on may  that the vibration feature that is currently available on controllers for playstation and playstation would be removed from the new playstation controller 
the playstation console system was launched in late in the united states and japan without vibration or any force feedback capability of any kind 
this course of action by sony has had material adverse consequences on our current and future gaming royalty revenues since our gaming royalties have primarily been from licensed third party controller products with vibration or force feedback capabilities that require some degree of vibration and or force feedback support or compatibility in the video console system to be viable products 
we do not know if this situation might change at some point in the life of the playstation console system  or whether or to what extent the playstation console will be compatible with third party peripherals containing force feedback capability in the future 
for the microsoft xbox video console system launched in november  microsoft has  to date  not broadly licensed third parties to produce game controllers 
because our gaming royalties come mainly from third party manufacturers  unless microsoft licenses additional third parties  our gaming royalty revenue will continue to decline 
for the nintendo wii video console system launched in december  nintendo has  to date  not yet broadly licensed third parties to produce game controllers for its wii game console 
because our gaming royalties come mainly from third party manufacturers  unless nintendo licenses additional third party licensees  our gaming royalty revenue will continue to decline 
the decrease in medical royalty and license revenue in compared to was primarily due to a reduction in license revenue recognized on our license and development agreements with medtronic 
revenue recognition on the license and development agreements with medtronic is based on cost to cost percentage of completion  a decrease in activity on these contracts results in a decrease in revenue recognized 
touch interface product royalties increased in due to increased licensee revenue from signing a new licensee in late  and royalties from an increased number of vehicles manufactured with our technology incorporated in them 
product sales 
product sales increased by million or from to the increase in product sales was primarily due to increased medical product sales of million  mainly due to increased sales of our endovascular  needle based  and endoscopy simulators 
this increase in product sales was a result of pursuing a product growth strategy for our medical business  which includes developing new products  leveraging our industry alliances  and expanding international sales 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of  we completed and shipped a new endovascular simulator product and fulfilled a large order with medtronic 
our d product sales increased by  primarily due to increased sales of our microscribe and cyberforce products 
partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in product sales from touch interface products of  including decreased sales of force feedback electronics for arcade gaming due to a continued reduction in sales of our customers product which incorporated this solution as a result of their product s lifecycle 
development contracts and other revenue 
development contracts and other revenue increased by  or from to development contracts and other revenue is comprised of revenue on commercial and government contracts 
government contract revenue increased by  primarily due to increased work performed under medical government contracts that were completed during the third quarter of commercial contract revenue increased by  mainly due to an increase in development contract revenue recognized from increased work on development contracts with medtronic

royalty and license revenue increased by  or from to the increase in royalty and license revenue was primarily a result of an increase in gaming royalties of  and 
table of contents an increase in automotive royalties and licensee revenue of  offset by a decrease in medical royalty and license revenue of million 
the increase in gaming royalties was mainly due to increased third party market share of aftermarket game console controllers  increased growth in the game console controller market  and royalties from new licensees signed in late and early in the console peripheral business  many of our third party licensees from whom we earn per unit royalties enjoyed the benefits of strong sales of premium products and significant market share growth in at the expense of first party peripheral makers ie  sony  microsoft  and nintendo 
third party peripheral makers market share tends to increase as consoles near end of life 
microsoft s xbox next generation video console system was introduced in november  and additional next generation consoles were expected to be introduced in late by sony and nintendo 
in the pc gaming peripheral business  the overall industry again declined  but this decline was more than offset by the aforementioned gains in the console peripheral business 
automotive royalties increased in due to increased licensee revenue from signing a new licensee in and royalties from an increased number of vehicles manufactured with our technology incorporated in them 
the decrease in medical royalty and license revenue in compared to was primarily due to a decrease in license revenue from our license and development agreements with medtronic 
product sales 
product sales increased by million or from to the increase in product sales was primarily due to increased medical product sales of million  in particular  increased sales of our needle based  endovascular  and laparoscopic simulator platforms 
this increase was a result of focusing sales force resources on selling training simulator products to hospitals and teaching institutions as well as targeted marketing programs and improved reseller performance 
offsetting this was a decrease of  in product sales mainly from our d  touch interface products  and microprocessors 
this decrease was primarily due to reduced sales of our d products such as our cyberglove and cybertouch devices caused by the delay in upgrades to this product line and increased competition  decreased sales of our force feedback electronics for arcade gaming due to the timing of product introductions by our customers  and reduced sales of microprocessors based on a decision to eliminate the sales effort related to this lower margin product line 
development contracts and other revenue 
development contracts and other revenue decreased by  or from to the decrease in this category was primarily due to decreases in both medical government and commercial development contract revenues  but was partially offset by an increase in development contracts in the industrial market 
the decrease in medical development contract revenue was due to a decrease in revenue recognized on our license and development agreements with medtronic and the continued transition of our medical engineering resources from government grants and certain commercial development contract efforts to product development efforts that focus on leveraging our existing sales and channel distribution capabilities

these increases were offset  in part by a decrease in write offs for physical inventory adjustments of  cost of product sales decreased as a percentage of product revenue to in from in this decrease is mainly due to a favorable shift in the mix of products sold during the year and improved margins on our endoscopy and endovascular simulator products 
our higher margin medical products were a more significant portion of the overall product revenue mix during in addition  product margins on our medical products improved due in part to price increases and cost reductions due to product modifications 

table of contents the cost of product sales increased by  or from to this increase was mainly due to increased product sales of and the corresponding increased direct materials  freight costs to customers  and royalties  as well as increased inventory write offs  offset in part by decreased overhead and decreased price and cost variances 
increased volume related expense such as increased direct materials  increased freight costs  and increased royalties accounted for  of the increase in cost of product sales from to of the aforementioned amount  direct materials only increased by  due to favorable product mix shifts resulting from increased sales of higher margin products such as our vascular access training simulators and reduced sales of our lower margin microprocessors 
additionally during  we experienced increased physical inventory write offs  scrap charges  and increased reserves for excess and obsolete inventory of  due to some product and process transitions during the period

for the year ended  we reversed the tax provision that had been recorded in no tax provision was required for the year ended december  due to a net loss in that period 
subsequent to december   in may  revenue procedure rev 
proc 
was issued by the internal revenue service 
this revenue procedure allows taxpayers a limited deferral beyond the taxable year of receipt for certain advance payments 
qualifying taxpayers generally may defer to the next succeeding year the inclusion in gross income for federal income tax purposes of advance payments to the extent the advance payments are not recognized or  in certain cases  are not earned in the taxable year of receipt

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued fin fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
fin prescribes a two step process to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized 
first  the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon examination 
if the tax position is deemed more likely than not to be sustained  the tax position is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of fin will have on our financial position and results of operations 
in september  the sec issued sab no 
 regarding the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements 
sab no 
states that registrants should use both a balance sheet approach and an income statement approach when quantifying and evaluating the materiality of a misstatement

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have limited exposure to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio 
an increase or decrease in interest rates would not significantly increase or decrease interest expense on debt obligations due to the fixed nature of our debt obligations 
our foreign operations are limited in scope and thus we are not materially exposed to foreign currency fluctuations
