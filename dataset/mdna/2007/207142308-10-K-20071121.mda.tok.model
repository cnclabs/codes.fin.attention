item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in part ii  item of this report and the risk factors included in part i  item a of this report  as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this report 
overview we design  develop and sell semiconductor system solutions  comprised of semiconductor devices  software and reference designs  for use in broadband communications applications that enable high speed transmission  processing and distribution of audio  video  voice and data to and throughout homes and business enterprises worldwide 
our access solutions connect people through personal communications access products  such as personal computers pcs and television set top boxes stbs  to audio  video  voice and data services over wireless and wire line broadband connections as well as over dial up internet connections 
our central office solutions are used by service providers to deliver high speed audio  video  voice and data services over copper telephone lines and optical fiber networks to homes and businesses around the globe 
in addition  our media processing products enable the capture  display  storage  playback and transfer of audio and video content in applications throughout home and small office environments 
these solutions enable broadband connections and network content to be shared throughout a home or small office home office environment using a variety of communications devices  which we describe as the broadband digital home 
our fiscal year is the or week period ending on the friday closest to september fiscal years  and were week years and ended on september   september   and september   respectively 
business enterprise segments we operate in one reportable segment  broadband communications 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual consolidated financial statements 
although we had four operating segments at september   under the aggregation criteria set forth in sfas no 
 we only operate in one reportable segment  broadband communications 
under sfas no 
 two or more operating segments may be aggregated into a single operating segment for financial reporting purposes if aggregation is consistent with the objective and basic principles of sfas no 
 if the segments have similar economic characteristics  and if the segments are similar in each of the following areas the nature of products and services  the nature of the production processes  the type or class of customer for their products and services  and the methods used to distribute their products or provide their services 
we meet each of the aggregation criteria for the following reasons the sale of semiconductor products is the only material source of revenue for each of our four operating segments  the products sold by each of our operating segments use the same standard manufacturing process  the products marketed by each of our operating segments are sold to similar customers  and all of our products are sold through our internal sales force and common distributors 
because we meet each of the criteria set forth above and each of our operating segments has similar economic characteristics  we aggregate our results of operations in one reportable segment 

table of contents beginning in fiscal  we changed the organizational structure of two of our product lines 
our convergence video products were realigned into the newly named imaging and pc media unit previously named universal access from our broadband media processing unit 
net revenues by product line have been restated for all periods in order to conform to the new groupings 
net revenues by product line are as follows in thousands fiscal year ended imaging and pc media broadband access products broadband media processing products embedded wireless networking products subsequent to fiscal year end  we decided to discontinue investments in stand alone wireless networking products and technologies 
as a result  we have moved gateway oriented wireless lan products and technologies  which enable and support our dsl gateway solutions  into our broadband access product line beginning in fiscal net revenues by product line after giving effect to the change in product line groups are as follows in thousands fiscal year ended imaging and pc media broadband access products broadband media processing products results of operations net revenues we recognize revenue when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the sales price and terms are fixed and determinable  and iv the collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
these terms are typically met upon shipment of product to the customer  except for certain distributors who have unlimited contractual rights of return or for whom the contractual terms were not enforced  or when significant vendor obligations exist 
revenue with respect to sales to distributors with unlimited rights of return or for whom contractual terms were not enforced is deferred until the purchased products are sold by the distributors to third parties 
at september  and september   deferred revenue related to sales to these distributors was million and million  respectively 
revenue with respect to sales to customers to whom we have significant obligations after delivery is deferred until all significant obligations have been completed 
at september  and september   deferred revenue related to shipments of products for which we have on going performance obligations was million and million  respectively 
the majority of our distributors have limited stock rotation rights  which allow them to rotate up to of product in their inventory two times a year 
we recognize revenue to these distributors upon shipment of product to the distributor  as the stock rotation rights are limited and we believe that we have the ability to reasonably estimate and establish allowances for expected product returns in accordance with sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
development revenue is recognized when services are performed and was not significant for any periods presented 
our net revenues decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in average selling prices asps and  to a lesser extent  a decrease in unit volume shipments 
during fiscal  we experienced revenue decreases in a majority of our product lines  with the exception of our broadband media processing products which experienced a million increase in net 
table of contents revenues resulting from a cable set top box program and a full system solution satellite set top box product ramping into production in the latter part of calendar our net revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was driven by a increase in unit volume shipments  which was partially offset by a decrease in asps 
the unit volume shipments increased in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of i the approximate million channel inventory reduction at our distributors and estimated million inventory reduction at our direct customers in the first half of fiscal and ii increased demand for our broadband media processing products as satellite set top box design wins began to ramp into production and  to a lesser extent  for our broadband access central office products due to market share gains 
gross margin gross margin represents net revenues less cost of goods sold 
as a fabless semiconductor company  we use third parties for wafer production and assembly and test services 
our cost of goods sold consists predominantly of purchased finished wafers  assembly and test services  royalties  amortization of production photo mask costs  other intellectual property costs  labor and overhead associated with product procurement  and non cash stock based compensation charges for procurement personnel 
our gross margin percentage for fiscal was compared with for fiscal during fiscal  we recorded a million gain related to the cancellation of a wafer supply and services agreement with jazz semiconductor jazz  which was recorded as a reduction of cost of sales 
excluding this gain  the impact of changes to our inventory reserves and the impact of changes to revenue reserves that we maintain to estimate customer pricing adjustments  our gross margin percentage for would have been resulting in the gross margin in remaining relatively stable compared to because of manufacturing cost reductions offsetting the reduction in asps for fiscal our gross margin percentage for fiscal was compared with for fiscal during fiscal  we recorded a million gain related to the cancellation of a wafer supply and services agreement with jazz  which was recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold 
excluding the wafer supply termination agreement gain  the impact of changes to our inventory reserves  and the impact of changes to revenue reserves that we maintain to estimate customer pricing adjustments in both fiscal and  our gross margin percentage would have been for fiscal compared to for fiscal the higher gross margin percentage in fiscal can be attributed to the benefits of our product cost reduction initiatives  as well as more stable product pricing 
we assess the recoverability of our inventories on a quarterly basis through a review of inventory levels in relation to foreseeable demand  generally over the following twelve months 
foreseeable demand is based upon available information  including sales backlog and forecasts  product marketing plans and product life cycle information 
when the inventory on hand exceeds the foreseeable demand  we write down the value of those inventories which  at the time of our review  we expect to be unable to sell 
the amount of the inventory write down is the excess of historical cost over estimated realizable value 
once established  these write downs are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the excess inventory 
demand for our products may fluctuate significantly over time  and actual demand and market conditions may be more or less favorable than those projected by management 
in the event that actual demand is lower than originally projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
similarly  in the event that actual demand exceeds original projections  gross margins may be favorably impacted in future periods 
during fiscal and  we recorded million and million  respectively  of net charges for excess and obsolete e o inventory 
activity in our e o inventory reserves for fiscal and was as follows in thousands 
table of contents fiscal year ended e o reserves  beginning of period additions release upon sales of product scrap standards adjustments and other e o reserves  end of period we review our e o inventory balances at the product line level on a quarterly basis 
we plan to scrap approximately of the e o inventory balances which existed as of september   and regularly evaluate the disposition of all e o inventory products 
it is possible that some of these reserved products will be sold which will benefit our gross margin in the period sold 
during fiscal and  we sold million and million  respectively  of reserved products 
our products are used by communications electronics oems that have designed our products into communications equipment 
for many of our products  we gain these design wins through a lengthy sales cycle  which often includes providing technical support to the oem customer 
moreover  once a customer has designed a particular supplier s components into a product  substituting another supplier s components often requires substantial design changes which involve significant cost  time  effort and risk 
in the event of the loss of business from existing oem customers  we may be unable to secure new customers for our existing products without first achieving new design wins 
when the quantities of inventory on hand exceed foreseeable demand from existing oem customers into whose products our products have been designed  we generally will be unable to sell our excess inventories to others  and the estimated realizable value of such inventories to us is generally zero 
on a quarterly basis  we also assess the net realizable value of our inventories 
when the estimated asp  plus costs to sell our inventory  falls below our inventory cost  we adjust our inventory to its current estimated market value 
during fiscal and  we recorded million and million  respectively  of inventory charges to adjust certain products to their estimated market values 
increases to the lower of cost or market lcm inventory reserves may be required based upon actual asps and changes to our current estimates  which would impact our gross margin percentage in future periods 
activity in our lcm inventory reserves for fiscal and was as follows in thousands fiscal year ended lcm reserves  beginning of period additions release upon sales of product standards adjustments and other lcm reserves  end of period research and development our research and development r d expenses consist principally of direct personnel costs to develop new semiconductor products  allocated indirect costs of the r d function  photo mask and other costs for pre production evaluation and testing of new devices and design and test tool costs 
our r d expenses also include the costs for design automation advanced package development and non cash stock based compensation charges for r d personnel 
r d expense increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase is the result of increased product development costs  a million increase in depreciation expense due to our expansion in the asia pacific region and the impact of million of credits related to property tax settlements that were recorded in fiscal these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in stock based compensation expense resulting from declines in the expense related to the stock options assumed in the merger with globespanvirata  inc in which are reaching the end of their three year vesting period 

table of contents r d expense increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a million increase in stock based compensation expense as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
r  share based payment  in the first quarter of fiscal this increase was partially offset by million of credits related to favorable property tax settlements  as well as overall cost reductions resulting from our restructuring actions which streamlined r d projects and shifted resources to lower cost regions 
selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative sg a expenses include personnel costs  sales representative commissions  advertising and other marketing costs 
our sg a expenses also include costs of corporate functions including legal  accounting  treasury  human resources  customer service  sales  marketing  field application engineering  allocated indirect costs of the sg a function  and non cash stock based compensation charges for sg a personnel 
sg a expense decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease is primarily attributable to a million decrease in stock based compensation expense  a million decrease in legal fees primarily due to the settlement of our litigation with texas instruments in the third quarter of fiscal and a million decrease in payroll expense as a result of our restructuring efforts 
these decreases were partially offset by the impact of million of credits related to property tax settlements that were recorded in fiscal the decrease in stock based compensation expense resulted from declines in the expense related to the stock options assumed in the merger with globespanvirata  inc in reaching the end of their three year vesting period 
sg a expense increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to a million increase in stock based compensation expense as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
r in the first quarter of fiscal this increase was partially offset by million of credits related to favorable property tax settlements and a million decrease in legal fees 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets consists of amortization expense for intangible assets acquired in various business combinations 
our intangible assets are being amortized over a weighted average period of approximately five years 
amortization expense decreased million in fiscal compared to the fiscal these decreases were due to the million impairment charge and write down of certain intangible assets in the second quarter of fiscal  the modification of the useful lives of some of the intangible assets acquired in the merger with globespanvirata  inc and some intangible assets becoming fully amortized during fiscal amortization expense decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal due to several intangible assets becoming fully amortized during fiscal and asset impairments asset impairment charges for fiscal of million consisted primarily of goodwill impairment charges of million  intangible impairment charges of million and property  plant and equipment charges of million resulting from declines in the performance of certain broadband media products and declines in the embedded wireless network product lines coupled with our decision to discontinue further investment in stand alone wireless networking product lines 
impairment charges for fiscal of million were primarily associated with leasehold improvements in facilities that were vacated as part or our restructuring activities in fiscal 
table of contents special charges fiscal year ended in thousands litigation charges restructuring charges integration charges credits other special charges special charges for fiscal consist primarily of an million charge for the settlement of our litigation with orckit communications ltd 
and restructuring charges of million that were primarily comprised of employee severance and termination benefit costs related to our fiscal restructuring actions and  to a lesser extent  facilities related charges mainly resulting from the accretion of rent expense related to our fiscal restructuring action 
special charges for fiscal consisted primarily of a million charge related to the settlement of our patent infringement litigation with texas instruments incorporated texas instruments in may and million of net restructuring charges 
the restructuring charges were primarily comprised of employee severance and other termination benefit costs and facilities closure costs mainly for our fiscal restructuring action  partially offset by a net reduction of the accrual relating to our fiscal restructuring action due to revised estimates of the remaining employee severance and termination benefit costs to be paid 
special charges for fiscal were comprised of million of restructuring charges  consisting of million for employee severance and termination benefit costs and of facilities charges primarily related to our fiscal restructuring action  million of integration charges related to the merger with globespanvirata  million for the settlement of a legal matter  and million of other special charges  including million of stock option and warrant modification charges 
interest expense interest expense increased million during fiscal compared to fiscal the average interest rate that we pay on our outstanding debt and our average debt balances during fiscal was higher than in fiscal due to the timing of the our debt issuances and retirements during fiscal and interest expense increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of an million short term credit facility we established in november the increase in interest expense as a result of the million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes issued in march and may was substantially offset by a decrease in interest expense as a result of the retirement of million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes and million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes in may  as well as the repurchase of million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due february 
table of contents other income expense  net fiscal year ended in thousands investment and interest income increase decrease in the fair value of derivative instruments impairment of equity securities gains on investments in equity securities other other income  net for fiscal was primarily comprised of million of investment and interest income on invested cash balances  million of gains on investments in equity securities  primarily the gain of million on the sale of the skyworks shares and investment credits realized on asset disposals 
other expense  net for fiscal was comprised of a million charge for the other than temporary impairment of equity securities including an million charge related to our million shares of skyworks common stock and a million decrease in the fair value of our warrant to purchase million shares of mindspeed common stock mainly due to a decline in mindspeed s stock price during fiscal  partially offset by million of investment and interest income on invested cash balances and million of gains on investments in equity securities 
other income  net for fiscal was primarily comprised of million of gains on sales of equity securities primarily from sales of approximately million shares of sirf technologies holdings  inc  a million increase in the fair value of derivative instruments primarily our mindspeed warrant due to an increase in mindspeed s stock price during fiscal  and million of investment and interest income on invested cash balances 
provision for income taxes in fiscal  and  we recorded income tax provisions of million  million and million  respectively  primarily reflecting income taxes imposed on our foreign subsidiaries 
all of our us federal income taxes and the majority of our state income taxes are offset by fully reserved deferred tax assets 
except to the extent of the federal and state alternative minimum tax amt  we expect this to continue for the foreseeable future 
however  we also expect our tax provision to increase in future years due to our continued expansion in low cost regions outside of the us  primarily in india and china  and due to the scheduled expiration of certain tax holidays in india in fiscal as of september   we had approximately billion of net deferred income tax assets  which are primarily related to us federal income tax net operating loss nol carryforwards and capitalized r d expenses and which can be used to offset taxable income in subsequent years 
approximately million of the nol carryforwards were acquired in business combinations  and if we receive a tax benefit from their utilization  the benefit will be recorded as a reduction to goodwill 
the deferred tax assets acquired in the merger with globespanvirata are subject to limitations imposed by section of the internal revenue code 
such limitations are not expected to impair our ability to utilize these deferred tax assets 
as of september   we have a valuation allowance recorded against the majority of our deferred tax assets  resulting in net deferred tax assets of million 
we do not expect to recognize any domestic income tax benefits relating to future operating losses until we believe that such tax benefits are more likely than not to be realized 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions and have also acquired and divested certain businesses for which we have retained certain tax liabilities 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations in which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain and significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
we and our acquired and divested businesses are regularly under audit by tax authorities 
although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable  the 
table of contents final determination of tax audits could be different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals 
based on the results of an audit  a material effect on our income tax provision  net income  or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
this interpretation clarifies the application of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  by defining a criterion that an individual tax position must meet for any part of the benefit of that position to be recognized in an enterprise s financial statements and also provides guidance on measurement  derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   but earlier adoption is permitted 
the company will adopt fin no later than the first quarter of fiscal the company is currently assessing the impact the adoption of fin will have on its financial position and results of operations 
gain loss on equity method investments gain loss on equity method investments includes our share of the earnings or losses of the investments that are recorded under the equity method of accounting  as well as the gains and losses recognized on the sale of our equity method investments 
gain on equity method investments for fiscal primarily consisted of a million gain from the sale of our investment in jazz 
loss on equity method investments for fiscal primarily consisted of a million loss from our investment in jazz including our share of jazz s expense related to the cancellation of the wafer supply and services agreement 
loss on equity method investments for fiscal primarily consisted of a million loss from our investment in jazz and million of losses from our other equity method investments 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were as follows september  september  in thousands cash and cash equivalents marketable debt securities subtotal marketable equity securities skyworks million shares at september  total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased million between september  and september  the decrease was primarily due to the retirement of the remaining million principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes at maturity in february  capital expenditures of million  and cash used in operating activities of million  which were partially offset by net proceeds of million received upon issuance of our floating rate senior secured notes in november and million of proceeds received for the sale of our investment in jazz in fiscal we also have other assets  including real estate in newport beach  california and a warrant to purchase million shares of mindspeed common stock 
the value of the mindspeed warrant of million is reflected as a long term asset on our consolidated balance sheet as of september  the valuation of this derivative instrument is subjective  and at any point in time could ultimately result in the realization of amounts significantly different than the carrying value 
further  there is no assurance that the equity markets would allow us to liquidate a substantial 
table of contents portion of this warrant within a short time period without significantly impacting the market value of mindspeed s common stock and the warrant 
at september   we had a total of million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes outstanding 
these notes are due in march  but the holders may require us to repurchase  for cash  all or part of their notes on march   march  and march  at a price of of the principal amount  plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
at september   we also had a total of million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior secured notes outstanding 
these notes are due in november  but we are required to offer to repurchase  for cash  notes at a price of of the principal amount  plus any accrued and unpaid interest  with the net proceeds of certain asset dispositions if such proceeds are not used within days to invest in assets other than current assets related to our business 
the sale of our investment in jazz in february and the sale of two other equity investments in january qualify as asset dispositions requiring us to make offers to repurchase a portion of the notes no later than days following the respective asset dispositions 
based on the proceeds received from these asset dispositions and our estimates of cash investments in assets other than current assets related to our business to be made within days following the asset dispositions  we estimate that we will be required to make offers to repurchase approximately million of the senior secured notes  at of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest  in the second quarter of fiscal we also have an million credit facility with a bank  under which we had borrowed million as of september  the term of this credit facility has been extended through november   and the facility remains subject to additional day extensions at the discretion of the bank 
we believe that our existing sources of liquidity  together with cash expected to be generated from product sales  will be sufficient to fund our operations  research and development  anticipated capital expenditures and working capital for at least the next twelve months  including the portion of our floating rate senior subordinated notes which we are required to make an offer to repurchase due to the asset sales we had in early calendar cash flows are as follows in thousands fiscal year ended net cash used in operating activities net cash provided by investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities net increase in cash and cash equivalents cash used in operating activities was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal during fiscal we used million of cash from operations and made payments totaling million for restructuring related items 
these cash outflows were partially offset by million of net favorable changes in our working capital accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable 
the net favorable working capital change was mainly caused by a decrease in days sales outstanding dso from days in the september quarter to days in the september quarter as a result of improved collections and sales linearity and decreased inventory levels resulting from reductions in channel inventory and revenue declines 
cash used in operating activities was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal cash generated from operations during fiscal was million  which was more than offset by million of net unfavorable changes in our working capital accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable  a million payment related to the settlement of our litigation with texas instruments  million of legal costs associated with the texas instruments litigation  and million of payments related to other special charges and restructuring related items 
the net unfavorable working capital change was mainly caused by an increase in days sales outstanding dso from days in the september quarter to days in the september quarter 
this dso increase was primarily the result of sales linearity in the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 
table of contents cash used in operations during fiscal was million  before million of net favorable changes in accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable  an million payment to agere systems  inc for the settlement of patent litigation  million of legal costs associated with the texas instruments litigation and million of payments related to special charges and other restructuring related items 
the net favorable working capital change was driven by i improved dso primarily the result of increased cash collections  from days in the september quarter to days in the september quarter  and ii improved inventory turns from turns in the september quarter to turns in the september quarter 
cash provided by investing activities was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the increase is the result of cash proceeds generated on the fiscal sales of our equity investment in jazz of million  our stock ownership interest in jazz of million  our stock ownership in skyworks of million and the liquidation of our marketable security investments of million 
cash provided by investing activities was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the cash provided by investing activities in fiscal was primarily attributable to million net proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable debt securities and million of net proceeds from sales of non marketable equity securities 
these cash inflows from investing activities were substantially offset by capital expenditures of million partially due to our expansion efforts in india and china  million of payments related to previous business combinations  and million of restricted cash as required under our credit facility 
cash provided by investing activities of million for fiscal included net proceeds of million received from the purchase and sale leaseback of our headquarters facility in newport beach  california  million of proceeds from the sales of equity securities  primarily in sirf technology holdings  inc  and net proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable debt securities of million 
these cash inflows from investing activities were partially offset by payments for business combinations of million  capital expenditures of million  and purchases of non marketable equity securities of million 
cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal compared to cash provided by financing activities of million for fiscal the increased use of cash in financing activities is the net result of our retirement of million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due february offset by the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior secured notes in november cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the cash provided by financing activities during fiscal consisted of net proceeds of from the issuance of convertible subordinated notes due march  million of net proceeds from a credit facility and million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock based employee benefit plans 
these cash inflows from financing activities were partially offset by the retirement of million of our convertible subordinated notes due may and million of repurchases and retirements of a portion of our convertible subordinated notes due february cash provided by financing activities of million for fiscal consisted primarily of million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock based employee benefit plans 
the low level of proceeds from the exercise of stock options in fiscal reflects the depressed state of our stock price during fiscal and the impact of our option exchange program beginning in november 
table of contents contractual obligations at september  were as follows payments due by period less than more than in thousands total year years years years long term debt short term debt interest on debt operating leases capital leases assigned leases purchase commitments capital commitments the above table excludes the impact of the october extension of the million credit facility 
the credit facility was extended to november  as discussed above  the holders of the million convertible subordinated notes due march could require us to repurchase all or part of their notes as early as march  as a result  the convertible subordinated notes are presented as being due in years in the table above 
also as discussed above  we are required to offer to repurchase all or part of the million senior secured notes due november with the net proceeds of certain asset dispositions if such proceeds are not used within days to invest in assets other than current assets related to our business 
the sale of our investment in jazz in february and the sale of two other equity investments in january qualify as asset dispositions requiring us to make offers to repurchase a portion of the notes no later than days following the respective asset dispositions 
based on the proceeds received from these asset dispositions and our estimates of cash investments in assets other than current assets related to our business to be made within days following the asset dispositions  we estimate that we will be required to make offers to repurchase approximately million of the senior secured notes  at of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest  in the second quarter of fiscal as such  million of the senior secured notes are presented as being due in less than one year in the table above 
at september   the company had many sublease arrangements on operating leases for terms ranging from near term to approximately eight years 
aggregate scheduled sublease income based on current terms is approximately million and is not reflected in the table above 
in october  we acquired the assets of zarlink semiconductor inc s packet switching business for million 
under the terms of the zarlink acquisition  we may be required to pay additional amounts based upon the achievement of certain revenue targets 
as of september   we estimated an additional and final purchase payment of million to be paid in december off balance sheet arrangements we have made guarantees and indemnities  under which we may be required to make payments to a guaranteed or indemnified party  in relation to certain transactions 
in connection with our spin off from rockwell international corporation rockwell  we assumed responsibility for all contingent liabilities and then current and future litigation including environmental and intellectual property proceedings against rockwell or its subsidiaries in respect of the operations of the semiconductor systems business of rockwell 
in connection with our contribution of certain of our manufacturing operations to jazz  we agreed to indemnify jazz for certain environmental matters and other customary divestiture related matters 
in connection with the sales of our products  we provide intellectual property indemnities to our customers 
in connection with certain facility leases  we have indemnified our lessors for certain claims arising from the facility or the lease 
we indemnify our directors and officers to the maximum extent permitted under the laws of the state of delaware 

table of contents the durations of our guarantees and indemnities vary  and in many cases are indefinite 
the guarantees and indemnities to customers in connection with product sales generally are subject to limits based upon the amount of the related product sales 
the majority of other guarantees and indemnities do not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential future payments we could be obligated to make 
we have not recorded any liability for these guarantees and indemnities in our consolidated balance sheets 
product warranty costs are not significant 
special purpose entities we have one special purpose entity  conexant usa  llc  which was formed in september in anticipation of establishing an accounts receivable financing facility 
this special purpose entity is a wholly owned  consolidated subsidiary of ours 
conexant usa  llc is not permitted  nor may its assets be used  to guarantee or satisfy obligations of conexant systems  inc or any subsidiary of conexant systems  inc on november   we established an accounts receivable financing facility whereby we will sell  from time to time  certain insured accounts receivable to conexant usa  llc  and conexant usa  llc entered into an million revolving credit agreement with a bank which is secured by the assets of the special purpose entity

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
among the significant estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements are those relating to business combinations  revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts  inventories  long lived assets  deferred income taxes  valuation of warrants  valuation of equity securities  stock based compensation and restructuring charges 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
to the extent actual results differ from those estimates  our future results of operations may be affected 
business combinations we account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting which requires that the assets and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values 
because of the expertise required to value intangible assets and in process research and development ipr d  we typically engage a third party valuation firm to assist management in determining those values 
valuation of intangible assets and ipr d entails significant estimates and assumptions including  but not limited to determining the timing and expected costs to complete projects  estimating future cash flows from product sales  and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project 
we believe that the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions 
to the extent actual results differ from those estimates  our future results of operations may be affected by incurring charges to our statements of operations 
additionally  estimates for purchase price allocations may change as subsequent information becomes available 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the sales price and terms are fixed and determinable  and iv the collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
these terms are typically met upon shipment of product to the customer  except for certain distributors who have unlimited contractual rights of return or for whom the contractual terms were not enforced  or when significant vendor obligations exist 
revenue with respect to sales to distributors with unlimited rights of return or for whom contractual terms were not enforced is deferred until the products are sold by the distributors to third parties 
at september  and september   deferred revenue related to sales to these distributors was million and million  respectively 
revenue with respect to sales to customers to whom we have significant obligations after delivery is deferred until all significant obligations have been completed 
at september  and september   deferred revenue related to shipments of products for which we have on going performance obligations was million and million  respectively 
the majority of our distributors have limited stock rotation rights  which allow them to rotate up to of product in their inventory two times a year 
we recognize revenue to these distributors upon shipment of product to the distributor  as the stock rotation rights are limited and we believe that we have the ability to reasonably estimate and establish allowances for expected product returns in accordance with sfas no 
development revenue is recognized when services are performed and was not significant for any periods presented 
our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenue is a key component of our operations and the timing of revenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses  such as sales commissions 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenues could cause our operating results to vary significantly from period to period 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we use a specific identification method for some items  and a percentage of aged receivables for others 
the percentages are determined based on our past experience 
if the financial condition of our 
table of contents customers were to deteriorate  our actual losses may exceed our estimates  and additional allowances would be required 
at september  and september   our allowances for doubtful accounts were million and million  respectively 
inventories we assess the recoverability of our inventories at least quarterly through a review of inventory levels in relation to foreseeable demand  generally over twelve months 
foreseeable demand is based upon all available information  including sales backlog and forecasts  product marketing plans and product life cycle information 
when the inventory on hand exceeds the foreseeable demand  we write down the value of those inventories which  at the time of our review  we expect to be unable to sell 
the amount of the inventory write down is the excess of historical cost over estimated realizable value 
once established  these write downs are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the excess inventory 
demand for our products may fluctuate significantly over time  and actual demand and market conditions may be more or less favorable than those projected by management 
in the event that actual demand or product pricing is lower than originally projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
further  on a quarterly basis  we assess the net realizable value of our inventories 
when the estimated average selling price of our inventory net of selling expenses falls below our inventory cost  we adjust our inventory to its current estimated market value 
at september  and september   our inventory reserves were million and million  respectively 
long lived assets long lived assets  including fixed assets and intangible assets other than goodwill  are continually monitored and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
the determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset and its eventual disposition 
the estimate of cash flows is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance  growth rates and other factors 
estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions  changes to our business model or changes in operating performance 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss will be recognized  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
fair value is determined using available market data  comparable asset quotes and or discounted cash flow models 
goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable  in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or one level below the operating segment 
goodwill impairment testing is a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  and the second step of the impairment test would be unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss must be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
goodwill impairment testing requires significant judgment and management estimates  including  but not limited to  the determination of i the number of reporting units  ii the goodwill and other assets and liabilities to be allocated to the reporting units and iii the fair values of the reporting units 
the estimates and assumptions described above  along with other factors such as discount rates  will significantly affect the outcome of the impairment tests and the amounts of any resulting impairment losses 
deferred income taxes we evaluate our deferred income tax assets and assess the need for a valuation allowance quarterly 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax assets to the net amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance is based upon our history of operating results  
table of contents expectations of future taxable income and the ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies available to us 
in the event that we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our deferred income tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred income tax assets would be charged against income in the period such determination is made 
likewise  in the event we were to determine that we will more likely than not be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred income tax assets would increase income in the period such determination is made 
to the extent that we realize a benefit from reducing the valuation allowance on acquired deferred income tax assets  the benefit will be credited to goodwill 
valuation of warrants we have a warrant to purchase million shares of mindspeed common stock 
the fair value of this warrant is determined using a standard black scholes merton valuation model with assumptions consistent with current market conditions and our intent to liquidate the warrant over a specified time period 
the black scholes merton valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility 
changes in these assumptions  or in the underlying valuation model  could cause the fair value of the mindspeed warrant to vary significantly from period to period 
valuation of equity securities we have a portfolio of strategic investments in non marketable equity securities and also hold certain marketable equity securities 
we review equity securities periodically for other than temporary impairments  which requires significant judgment 
in determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary  we evaluate  among other factors  i the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  ii the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer and iii our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
these reviews may include assessments of each investee s financial condition  its business outlook for its products and technology  its projected results and cash flows  the likelihood of obtaining subsequent rounds of financing and the impact of any relevant contractual equity preferences held by us or by others 
we have experienced substantial impairments in the value of our equity securities over the past few years 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in our inability to recover the carrying amounts of our investments  which could require additional impairment charges to write down the carrying amounts of such investments 
stock based compensation in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r 
this pronouncement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r requires that companies account for awards of equity instruments issued to employees under the fair value method of accounting and recognize such amounts in their statements of operations 
we adopted sfas no 
r on october  under sfas no 
r  we are required to measure compensation cost for all stock based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognize compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations over the service period that the awards are expected to vest 
as permitted under sfas no 
r  we elected to recognize compensation cost for all options with graded vesting granted on or after october  on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the entire option 
for options with graded vesting granted prior to october   we will continue to recognize compensation cost over the vesting period following the accelerated recognition method described in fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans  as if each underlying vesting date represented a separate option grant

r and ii compensation cost for the unvested portion of options granted prior to october  over their remaining vesting periods using the fair value amounts previously measured under sfas no 
r for pro forma disclosure purposes 
consistent with the valuation method for the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
r  we use the black scholes merton model to value the compensation expense associated with stock options under sfas no 
r 
in 
table of contents addition  forfeitures are estimated when recognizing compensation expense  and the estimate of forfeitures will be adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent that actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ  from such estimates 
changes in estimated forfeitures will be recognized through a cumulative catch up adjustment in the period of change and will also impact the amount of compensation expense to be recognized in future periods 
the black scholes merton model requires certain assumptions to determine an option fair value  including expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rate  and expected life of the option 
the expected stock price volatility rates are based on the historical volatility of our common stock 
the risk free interest rates are based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the option or award 
the average expected life represents the weighted average period of time that options or awards granted are expected to be outstanding  as calculated using the simplified method described in the securities and exchange commission s sab no 
consistent with the provisions of sfas no 
r  we measure service based awards at the stock price on the grant date  performance based awards at the stock price on the grant date effected for performance conditions which we believe may impact vesting or exercisability and market performance based awards using the monte carlo simulation method giving consideration to the range of various vesting probabilities 
restructuring charges restructuring activities and related charges have related primarily to reductions in our workforce and related impact on the use of facilities 
the estimated charges contain estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time that the assumptions are made for example  the timing and amount of sublease income that will be achieved on vacated property and the operating costs to be paid until lease termination  and the discount rates used in determining the present value fair value of remaining minimum lease payments on vacated properties 
while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used in the relevant periods  the actual results may be different  and those differences could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial position or results of operations 
our policies require us to review the estimates and assumptions periodically and to reflect the effects of any revisions in the period in which they are determined to be necessary 
such amounts also contain estimates and assumptions made by management  and are reviewed periodically and adjusted accordingly

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  the mindspeed warrant  short term debt and long term debt 
our main investment objectives are the preservation of investment capital and the maximization of after tax returns on our investment portfolio 
consequently  we invest with only high credit quality issuers  and we limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer 
our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments 
as of september   the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value 
we hold a warrant to purchase million shares of mindspeed common stock at an exercise price of per share through june for financial accounting purposes  this is a derivative instrument and the fair value of the warrant is subject to significant risk related to changes in the market price of mindspeed s common stock 
as of september   a decrease in the market price of mindspeed s common stock would result in a decrease in the fair value of this warrant of approximately million 
at september   the market price of mindspeed s common stock was per share 
during fiscal  the market price of mindspeed s common stock ranged from a low of per share to a high of per share 
our short term debt consists of borrowings under a day credit facility 
interest related to our short term debt is at day libor plus  which is reset quarterly and was approximately at september  we do not believe our short term debt is subject to significant market risk 
our long term debt consists of convertible subordinated notes with interest at fixed rates and floating rate senior secured notes 
interest related to our floating rate senior secured notes is at three month libor plus  which is reset quarterly and was approximately at september  the fair value of our convertible subordinated notes is subject to significant fluctuation due to their convertibility into shares of our common stock 
the following table shows the fair values of our financial instruments as of september  in thousands in thousands carrying value fair value cash and cash equivalents mindspeed warrant short term debt long term debt senior secured notes long term debt convertible subordinated notes we transact business in various foreign currencies  and we have established a foreign currency hedging program utilizing foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge certain foreign currency transaction exposures 
under this program  from time to time  we offset foreign currency transaction gains and losses with gains and losses on the forward contracts  so as to mitigate our overall risk of foreign transaction gains and losses 
we do not enter into forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
at september   we had outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts with a notional amount of million indian rupees  approximately million  maturing at various dates through february based on the fair values of these contracts at september   we recorded a derivative asset of million at september  based on our overall currency rate exposure at september   a change in the currency rates would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
