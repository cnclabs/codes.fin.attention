item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
the following text contains references to years   and  which refer to our fiscal years ending or ended december   december   december  and january   respectively  unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires 
we use a week fiscal year ending on the saturday closest to december consequently  we periodically have a week fiscal year 
overview we earn revenues primarily from the sale of food and non food products to the foodservice  or food away from home  industry 
our expenses consist mainly of cost of goods sold  which includes the amounts paid to manufacturers for products  and operating expenses  which include primarily labor related expenses  delivery costs and occupancy expenses related to our facilities 
for discussion of our business and strategies  see the business section of this form k 
according to industry research  the restaurant industry captures nearly half of the total share of the consumer s food dollar and an industry research firm is projecting foodservice distributor sales to continue to grow in we believe the trends that are fueling the demand for food away from home include the aging of the baby boomer population  rising incomes  more two income households and consumer demand for convenience 
according to industry research  older adults on average spend significantly more on food away from home than younger adults do 
in addition  younger and higher income consumers are increasingly starved for time and looking for ways to save time by shifting meal preparation to others by dining out  including utilizing restaurant take out  or buying prepared or convenience foods 
consumers are seeking healthful and higher quality menu choices 
several national casual dining restaurants  including certain of our customers  have expanded their fresh food menu offerings in an effort to meet the demands of consumers seeking healthful and higher quality menu alternatives 
in addition  in an effort to reduce meal preparation time  consumers are seeking prepared or partially prepared food items from retail establishments 
the foodservice distribution industry is fragmented and consolidating 
in the last decade  the ten largest broadline foodservice distributors have significantly increased their collective market share through both acquiring smaller foodservice distributors and internal growth 
over the past decade  we have supplemented our internal growth through selective  strategic acquisitions 
we believe that the consolidation trends in the foodservice distribution industry will continue to present acquisition opportunities for us 
our net sales in increased over  with all of our sales growth coming from existing operations 
we estimate that food price inflation contributed approximately to our growth in net sales in sales trends reflect the result of our previously announced exit of certain multi unit business in late and early in our broadline segment and moderate industry growth 
gross profit margin  which we define as gross profit as a percentage of net sales  increased to in  compared to in  primarily due to the shift in customer mix in our broadline segment towards more street sales business  which typically carry a higher gross margin  and improvements related to our procurement initiatives 
our operating expense ratio  which we define as operating expenses as a percentage of net sales  increased to in  compared to in operating expenses were impacted by increased personnel costs in our broadline segment due to our investment in street sales personnel  our continued investment in information technology in our broadline segment  increased fuel costs in both segments and increased stock compensation costs in our corporate segment  partially offset by favorable trends in insurance costs 

table of contents going forward  we expect to continue our focus on executing our strategies  driving standardization of best practices and achieving operational excellence initiatives in each of our business segments 
we continue to seek innovative means of servicing our customers to distinguish ourselves from others in the marketplace

during  we exited approximately million of annualized multi unit sales and began the exit of an additional million in annualized multi unit sales  the majority of which was a result of our own initiative to rationalize business that did not meet our profit objectives 
in  broadline experienced growth in its multi unit business due to new multi unit customers that were added during the second half of in and  we continued our focus on increasing sales to independent restaurants and generated increased sales to existing customers and markets 
we refer to independent restaurants serviced by our sales representatives as street customers 
street customers tend to use more of our proprietary brands and value added services  resulting in higher margin sales 
we focus on sales of our proprietary brands  which typically generate higher margins than national brands 
sales of our proprietary brands represented of street sales in both and  compared to in we also focus on increasing our sales of center of the plate items  including beef  poultry  seafood and other proteins 
we believe that selling more center of the plate items positions us favorably with our customers

these losses are related to our receivables purchase facility  referred to as the receivables facility  and represent the discount from carrying value that we incur from our sale of receivables to the financial institution 
the receivables facility is discussed below in liquidity and capital resources 
the increase in the loss on sale of receivables in compared to was due to increased average interest rates and the increase in compared to was due to higher average levels of receivables sold under the receivables facility combined with increased average interest rates

the decline in our effective tax rate in from was primarily due to the increase in federal tax credits associated with the gulf opportunity zone  federal communications excise tax and worker opportunity tax credit programs

liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations and growth primarily with cash flows from operations  borrowings under our credit facilities  the issuance of long term debt  operating leases  normal trade credit terms and the sale of our common stock 
despite our growth in net sales  we have reduced our working capital needs by financing our investment in inventory principally with accounts payable and outstanding checks in excess of deposits 
we typically fund our acquisitions  and expect to fund future acquisitions  with our existing cash  additional borrowings under our credit facility and the issuance of debt or equity securities 
at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million  a decrease of million from december  the decrease in cash was due to cash used in investing activities of million and cash used in financing activities of million  partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of million and cash provided by discontinued operations of million

table of contents million of cash  including transaction costs  to repurchase approximately million shares of our outstanding common stock 
in  utilizing a portion of the net proceeds received from the sale of our former fresh cut segment  we repaid million of borrowings outstanding under our previous revolving credit facility and utilized million of cash  including transaction costs  to repurchase approximately million shares of our outstanding common stock 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for details of our share repurchase and retirement 
at december   total debt recorded on our consolidated balance sheet was million  which includes a capital lease obligation of million 
on october   we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement credit agreement that provides us with up to million in borrowing capacity  with a million sublimit for letters of credit  under our credit facility that expires on october  we have the right  without the consent of the lenders  to increase the total amount of the facility to million 
borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest  at our option  at the base rate  defined as the greater of the administrative agent s prime rate or the overnight federal funds rate plus  or libor plus a spread of to 
the credit agreement also provides for a fee ranging between and of unused commitments 
the credit agreement requires the maintenance of certain financial ratios  as described in the credit agreement  and contains customary events of default 
at december   we had no borrowings outstanding  million of letters of credit outstanding and million available under the credit facility  subject to compliance with customary borrowing conditions 
in  we reduced our total debt by million through a combination of debt repayments of million  partially offset by million in additional borrowings under our credit facility

checks in excess of deposits decreased by million in and million in and increased by million in checks in excess of deposits represent checks that we have written that are not yet cashed by the payee and in total exceed the current available cash balance at the respective bank 
the decrease in checks in excess of deposits is due to higher inventory levels and timing of payments due to our efforts to improve cash management 
we believe that our cash flows from operations  borrowings under our credit facility and the sale of undivided interests in receivables under our receivables facility  discussed below  will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
however  we will likely require additional sources of financing to the extent that we make acquisitions in the future 
the table below presents contractual cash obligations under long term debt  capital leases  operating leases and purchase obligations as of december  long term debt on our consolidated balance sheet includes both debt and a capital lease obligation 
lease payments include payments due under our existing operating and capital leases

purchase obligations do not include outstanding purchase orders for inventory in the normal course of business and do not include non cancelable service contracts 
the table does not include liabilities for deferred income taxes or the receivables facility 
this table should be read in conjunction with notes  and to our consolidated financial statements 
in thousands payments due by period year years years more than contractual obligations total and less and and years long term debt obligations  excluding interest operating and capital lease obligations purchase obligations total 
table of contents our broadline segment had outstanding purchase orders for capital projects totaling million at december  our customized segment had outstanding purchase orders for capital projects totaling million at december  these contracts and purchase orders expire at various times throughout also  at december   we had no outstanding contracts to purchase products 
we expect to use future cash flows from operations and residual cash proceeds from the sale of our former fresh cut segment to fund these obligations 
we have entered into numerous operating leases  including leases of buildings  equipment  tractors and trailers 
in certain of these leases  we have provided residual value guarantees to the lessors 
circumstances that would require us to perform under the guarantees include either our default on the leases with the leased assets being sold for less than the specified residual values in the lease agreements  or our decision not to purchase the assets at the end of the lease terms combined with the sale of the assets  with sales proceeds less than the residual value of the leased assets specified in the lease agreements 
our residual value guarantees under these operating lease agreements typically range between and of the value of the leased assets at inception of the lease 
these leases have original terms ranging from two to eight years and expiration dates ranging from to at december   the undiscounted maximum amount of potential future payments under these guarantees totaled million  which would be mitigated by the fair value of the leased assets at lease expiration 
our assessment as to whether it is probable that we will be required to make payments under the terms of the guarantees is based upon our actual and expected loss experience 
consistent with the requirements of financial accounting standard board interpretation no 
 we have recorded  of the million of potential future payments under these guarantees on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  additionally  we do not consider payments under these guarantees  if any  reasonably likely to have a material impact on our future consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
notes and to our consolidated financial statements provide further discussion of these guarantees and the related accounting and disclosure requirements 
in connection with the sale of our former fresh cut segment  we remained obligated on a guarantee of the future lease payments of one of the fresh cut segment facilities that was sold to chiquita 
we will be required to perform under the guarantee if chiquita defaults on its lease obligations 
in connection with the sale of the fresh cut segment to chiquita  chiquita assumed our obligation under the guarantee and agreed to indemnify us for any losses we suffer as a result of chiquita s failure to perform its assumed obligations 
consistent with the requirements of fin  we have recorded an estimated liability of million in our consolidated financial statements as of december  subsequent to the balance sheet date  we entered into a substitution of collateral and sale leaseback transaction involving the property subject to the guarantee and one of our broadline operating company s facilities 
as a result  we were released from the guarantee

stock based compensation prior to january   we accounted for our stock incentive plans and our stock purchase plan using the intrinsic value method of accounting provided under accounting principles board opinion no

share based compensation was a pro forma disclosure in the financial statement footnotes and continues to be provided for periods prior to fiscal effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  compensation cost recognized in fiscal includes compensation cost for all share based payments granted through december   but for which the requisite service period had not been completed as of december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas and compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
on february   the compensation committee of our board of directors voted to accelerate the vesting of certain unvested options to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock held by certain employees and officers under the employee stock incentive plan the plan and the equity incentive plan the plan  which had exercise prices greater than the closing price of our common stock on february  these options were accelerated such that upon the adoption of sfas r  effective january   we would not be required to incur any compensation cost related to the accelerated options 
we believe this decision was in our best interest and the best interest of our shareholders 
this acceleration did not result in us being required to recognize any compensation cost in our consolidated statement of earnings for the fiscal year ended december   as all stock options that were accelerated had exercise prices that were greater than the market price of our common stock on the date of modification  however  we were required to recognize all unvested compensation cost in our pro forma sfas disclosure in the period of acceleration 
the pro forma 
table of contents expense of the acceleration was approximately million  net of tax  which represents all future compensation expense of the accelerated stock options on february   the date of modification 
the total share based compensation cost recognized in operating expenses in our consolidated statements of earnings was million and million in and  respectively  which represents the expense associated with our stock options  restricted stock and shares purchased under the stock purchase plan 
there was no share based compensation cost recognized in the income tax benefit recognized in excess of the tax benefit related to the compensation cost incurred was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
at december   there was million and million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding stock options and restricted stock  respectively  which will be recognized over the remaining weighted average vesting periods of and years  respectively 
as a result of adopting sfas r on january   our earnings before income taxes and net earnings for were million and million lower  respectively  and basic eps and diluted eps for were both lower than if we had continued to account for share based compensation under apb discontinued operations in  we sold all our stock in the subsidiaries that comprised our fresh cut segment to chiquita brands international  inc for million and recorded a net gain of approximately million  net of approximately million in net tax expense 
of the net gain  approximately million represents post closing adjustments occurring after the initial gain was calculated upon closing of the transaction primarily related to final tax basis calculations 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas  depreciation and amortization were discontinued beginning february   the day after we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our former fresh cut segment 
this resulted in a reduction of pre tax expense of approximately million  or per share diluted  for during  the net gain on sale was decreased by  as a result of post closing adjustments related to the working capital finalization and tax return reconciliations 
earnings from discontinued operations for  excluding gain on sale  were million  net of taxes of million 
in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
 allocation of interest to discontinued operations  we allocated to discontinued operations certain interest expense on debt that was required to be repaid as a result of the sale and a portion of interest expense associated with our revolving credit facility and subordinated convertible notes 
the allocation percentage was calculated based on the ratio of net assets of the discontinued operations to consolidated net assets 
interest expense allocated to discontinued operations in and totaled million and million  respectively 
off balance sheet activities we have a receivables facility  which is generally described as off balance sheet financing 
in financing activities above  we describe certain purchase obligations and residual value guarantees  all of which could be considered off balance sheet items 
refer to the discussion in financing activities above and notes and to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our commitments  contingencies and leases 
the receivables facility represents off balance sheet financing because the transaction and the financial institution s ownership interest in certain of our accounts receivable results in assets being removed from our consolidated balance sheet to the extent that the transaction qualifies for sale treatment under generally accepted accounting principles 
this treatment requires us to account for the transaction with the financial institution as a sale of the undivided interest in the accounts receivable instead of reflecting the financial institution s net investment of million as debt 
we believe that the receivables facility provides us with additional liquidity at a very competitive cost compared to other forms of financing 
in july  we entered into the receivables facility  under which pfg receivables corporation  a wholly owned  special purpose subsidiary  sold an undivided interest in certain of our trade receivables 
pfg receivables corporation was formed for the sole purpose of buying receivables generated by certain of our operating units and selling an undivided interest in those receivables to a financial institution 
under the receivables facility  certain of our operating units sell their accounts receivable to pfg receivables corporation  which in turn  subject to certain conditions  may from time to time sell an undivided interest in these receivables to the financial institution 
our operating units continue to service the receivables on behalf of the financial institution at estimated market rates 
accordingly  we have not recognized a servicing asset or liability 

table of contents we received million of proceeds from the sale of the undivided interest in receivables under the receivables facility in in june  we increased the amount of the undivided interest in the receivables that can be owned by the financial institution to million 
in july  we sold an incremental undivided interest in receivables under the receivables facility and received an additional million in proceeds 
we used these proceeds to repay borrowings under our credit facility and to fund working capital needs 
on october   we sold another incremental undivided interest in receivables under the receivables facility and received an additional million in proceeds 
we used these proceeds to reduce amounts outstanding under the credit facility 
in june  the company extended the term of the receivables facility through june  if the receivables facility terminates  either at its scheduled termination date or upon the occurrence of specified events similar to events of default  payments on accounts receivable sold would be remitted to the financial institution in an amount equal to the institution s undivided interest 
at december   securitized accounts receivable totaled million  including million sold to the financial institution and derecognized from our consolidated balance sheet 
total securitized accounts receivable includes our residual interest in accounts receivable of million 
at december   securitized accounts receivable totaled million  including million sold to the financial institution and derecognized from our consolidated balance sheet and the residual interest of million 
the residual interest represents our retained interest in receivables held by pfg receivables corporation 
we measure the residual interest using the estimated discounted cash flows of the underlying accounts receivable  based on estimated collections and a discount rate approximately equivalent to our incremental borrowing rate 
losses on the sale of the undivided interest in receivables of million in  million in and million in are included in other expense  net  in our consolidated statements of earnings and represent our cost of securitizing those receivables with the financial institution 
we record the sale of the undivided interest in accounts receivable to the financial institution according to statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
accordingly  at the time the undivided interest in receivables is sold  the receivables are removed from our consolidated balance sheet 
we record a loss on the sale of the undivided interest in these receivables  which includes a discount  based upon the receivables credit quality and a financing cost for the financial institution  based upon a day commercial paper rate 
at december   the rate under the receivables facility was per annum 
business combinations during we paid approximately million related to contractual obligations in the purchase agreements for companies we acquired in and also during  we paid approximately million related to the settlement of an earnout agreement with the former owners of middendorf meat  this amount was accrued  with a corresponding increase to goodwill  in in  we paid million and issued approximately  shares of our common stock  net  valued at approximately  related to contractual obligations in the purchase agreements for all kitchens  which we acquired in  carroll county foods  which we acquired in  and other companies acquired 
as discussed above  we also accrued approximately million in related to the settlement of an earnout agreement with the former owners of middendorf meat 
subsequent events sale leaseback transaction in january  we entered into a substitution of collateral and sale leaseback transaction involving one of our broadline operating facilities and one of our former fresh cut segment operating facilities 
this transaction resulted in us being released from a guarantee of future lease payments on one of our former fresh cut segment facilities that was sold to chiquita  as discussed above and in note to our consolidated financial statements 
our broadline operating facility was sold to a third party and leased back to us pursuant to a lease agreement with an initial term expiring in this transaction resulted in a gain of approximately million 
included within the gain is the million liability that was established in connection with that guarantee 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases sale leaseback transactions involving real estate  the gain will be amortized over the life of the lease 
bond repayment in january  we paid off the remaining principal balance outstanding on our middendorf meat tax exempt private activity revenue bonds 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further description of these bonds 

table of contents application of critical accounting policies we have prepared our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis 
in preparing our financial statements  management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting periods 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex  consequently  actual results could differ from those estimates 
we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates we use to prepare our financial statements 
management s estimates are generally based upon historical experience and various other assumptions that we determine to be reasonable in light of the relevant facts and circumstances 
we believe that our critical accounting estimates include allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  goodwill and other intangible assets  insurance programs  vendor rebates and other promotional incentives  income taxes and share based compensation 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
we regularly analyze our significant customer accounts  and when we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position  we record a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount we reasonably believe is collectible 
we also record reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors  including the length of time the receivables are past due  the financial health of the customer  macroeconomic considerations and historical experience 
if circumstances related to specific customers or other factors change  we may need to adjust our estimates of the recoverability of receivables 
in  and  we wrote off uncollectible accounts receivable of million  million and million  respectively  against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in  and  we recorded estimates of million  million and million  respectively  in operating expenses to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventory valuation 
we maintain reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories 
these reserves are primarily based upon inventory age plus specifically identified inventory items and overall economic conditions 
a sudden and unexpected change in consumer preferences or change in overall economic conditions could result in a significant change in the reserve balance and could require a corresponding charge to earnings 
we actively manage our inventory levels to minimize the risk of loss and have consistently achieved a high level of inventory turnover 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
our goodwill and other intangible assets primarily include the cost of acquired subsidiaries in excess of the fair value of the tangible net assets recorded in connection with acquisitions 
other intangible assets include customer relationships  trade names  trademarks  patents and non compete agreements 
we use estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  assigning lives to acquired intangibles and evaluating those assets for impairment after acquisition 
these estimates and assumptions include indicators that would trigger an impairment of assets  whether those indicators are temporary  economic or competitive factors that affect valuation  discount rates and cash flow estimates 
when we determine that the carrying value of such assets is not recoverable  or the estimated lives assigned to such assets are improper  we must reduce the carrying value of the assets to the net realizable value or adjust the amortization period of the asset  recording any adjustment in our consolidated statements of earnings 
as of december   our unamortized goodwill was million and other intangible assets totaled million  net 
sfas no 
was effective at the beginning of  except for goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from business combinations completed subsequent to june   for which the standard was effective beginning july  in accordance with sfas no 
 we ceased amortizing goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives as of the beginning of sfas no 
requires us to assess goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually in the absence of an indicator of possible impairment and immediately upon an indicator of possible impairment by estimating the fair value of our reporting units and our intangible assets with indefinite lives 
if we determine that the fair values of our reporting units are less than the carrying amount of goodwill  we must recognize an impairment loss in our financial statements 
to perform the assessment of significant other non amortized intangible assets  we compare the book value of the asset to the discounted expected future operating cash flows to be generated by the specific asset 
if we determine the discounted future operating cash flows are less than the recorded values of other unamortized assets  we must recognize an impairment loss in our financial statements 
annually  we are also required to evaluate the remaining useful life of intangible assets that are not being amortized to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed our annual impairment assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for our broadline segment  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
our customized segment has no goodwill or other intangible assets 
in  and  no impairment loss was recorded based on these assessments 
in testing for potential impairment  we measured the estimated fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets with 
table of contents indefinite lives based upon discounting future operating cash flows using an appropriate discount rate 
a change in our estimates of projected future operating cash flows or discount rate used in our calculation of the fair value of the reporting units would have no impact on the reported value of our goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  we report intangible assets with definite lives at cost less accumulated amortization 
we compute amortization over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets  generally three to years 
we test these intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a particular asset may not be recoverable  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in order to evaluate the recoverability of an asset  we compare the carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if we determine that the estimated  undiscounted future cash flows of the asset are less than its carrying amount on our consolidated balance sheet  we must record an impairment loss in our financial statements 
in  and  no impairment loss was recorded for intangible assets with definite lives 
due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments and assumptions related to the valuation of the reporting units and intangible assets with definite lives  and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these valuations  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty 
therefore  as we become aware of additional information  we may change our estimates 
insurance programs 
we maintain self insurance programs covering portions of our general and vehicle liability  workers compensation and group medical insurance 
the amounts in excess of the self insured levels are fully insured by third parties  subject to certain limitations and exclusions 
the company utilizes third party actuaries to assist in the calculation of these reserves 
we accrue an estimated liability for these self insured programs  including an estimate for incurred but not reported claims  based on known claims and past claims history 
these accrued liabilities are included in accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheets 
our reserves for insurance claims include estimates of the frequency and timing of claim occurrences  as well as the ultimate amounts to be paid 
the accounting estimate of the self insurance liability includes both known and incurred but not reported insurance claims 
this estimate is highly susceptible to change from period to period if claims differ from past claims history  which could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
if we experience claims in excess of our estimates by  our insurance expense and related insurance liability would increase by million  negatively affecting our consolidated financial statements 
vendor rebates and other promotional incentives 
we participate in various rebate and promotional incentives with our suppliers  including volume and growth rebates  annual and multi year incentives and promotional programs 
in accounting for vendor rebates  we follow the guidance in eitf no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor and eitf no 
 application of issue no 
by resellers to sales incentives offered to consumers by manufacturers 
we generally record consideration received under these incentives as a reduction of cost of goods sold 
however  in certain circumstances  we record the consideration as a reduction of costs that we incur 
we may receive consideration in the form of cash and or invoice deductions 
we treat changes in the estimated amount of incentives to be received as changes in estimates and recognize them in the period of change 
we record consideration that we receive for incentives containing volume and growth rebates and annual and multi year incentives as a reduction of cost of goods sold 
we systematically and rationally allocate the consideration for these incentives to each of the underlying transactions that results in progress by us toward earning the incentives 
if the incentives are not probable and reasonably estimable  we record the incentives as the underlying objectives or milestones are achieved 
we record annual and multi year incentives when we earn them  generally over the agreement period 
we estimate whether we will achieve the underlying objectives or milestones using current and historical purchasing data  forecasted purchasing volumes and other factors 
we record consideration received to promote and sell the supplier s products as a reduction of our costs  as the consideration is typically a reimbursement of costs incurred by us 
if we receive consideration from the suppliers in excess of our costs  we record any excess as a reduction of cost of goods sold 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we must make judgments in determining our provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of business  many transactions occur for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain at the time of the transaction 
we adjust our income tax provision in the period in which we determine that it is probable that our actual results will differ from our estimates 
tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted 
at december  and december   we had million and million  respectively  of net deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carry forwards for state income tax purposes 
the net operating loss carry forwards at december  expire in years through additionally  at december   we had certain state income tax credit 
table of contents carry forwards  which expire in years through our realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon future taxable income 
we evaluate the need to record valuation allowances that would reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
when assessing the need for valuation allowances  we project future taxable income and consider prudent and feasible tax planning strategies  such as the legal entity changes in which we converted  through merger or conversion  most of our broadline operating company subsidiaries to limited liability companies 
should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years  we would record valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs  along with a corresponding charge to net earnings 
based on our evaluation  we recorded an allowance that is adequate to reduce the total deferred tax asset to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
share based compensation 
on january   we adopted sfas r  which requires all share based payments  including grants of stock options  restricted shares and shares issued under the stock purchase plan  to be recognized in the income statement as an operating expense  based on their grant date fair values 
during and  our total share based compensation costs were million and million  respectively 
at december  there was million and million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding options and restricted stock  respectively  which has been reduced by an estimate for anticipated forfeitures 
we estimate the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using a black scholes based option pricing model 
the black scholes pricing model utilizes the following estimations and assumptions expected volatility  expected option term  and the risk free interest rate 
expected volatility is based on the historical fluctuations in the price of our stock 
expected option term is based on our historical option exercise history 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve at the date of grant 
in addition  we estimate our expected forfeitures for restricted stock and stock options using our historical forfeiture data 
our expected forfeiture estimate is used to reduce our gross share based compensation expense in accordance with sfas r 
changes in the above mentioned black scholes model inputs and or forfeiture rate could have an impact on our earnings 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the above disclosure 
our financial statements contain other items that require estimation  but are not as critical as those discussed above 
these include our calculations for bonus accruals  depreciation and amortization 
changes in estimates and assumptions used in these and other items could have an effect on our consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for servicing of financial assets sfas 
sfas requires an entity to recognize a servicing asset or liability each time it undertakes an obligation to service a financial asset by entering into a servicing contract in certain situations and requires all separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities to be initially measured at fair value  if practicable 
sfas no 
will be effective for our fiscal year 
the adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement fin prescribes a comprehensive model for recognizing  measuring  presenting and disclosing in the financial statements tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  including a decision whether to file or not to file income tax returns in a particular jurisdiction 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  if there are changes in net assets as a result of application of fin  these will be accounted for as an adjustment to beginning retained earnings 
we will adopt the provisions of fin in our first fiscal quarter of we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

table of contents quarterly results and seasonality set forth below is certain summary information with respect to our operations for the most recent eight fiscal quarters 
all of the fiscal quarters set forth below had weeks 
historically  the restaurant and foodservice business is seasonal  with lower profit in the first quarter 
consequently  we may experience lower net profit during the first quarter  depending on the timing of any future acquisitions

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risks are related to fluctuations in interest rates and changes in commodity prices 
our primary interest rate risk is from changing interest rates related to any borrowings under our credit facility 
we currently manage this risk through a combination of fixed and floating rates on these obligations 
as of december   our total debt of million  including a capital lease obligation of million  consisted entirely of fixed rate debt 
as of december   our total debt of million consisted entirely of fixed rate debt 
in addition  our receivables facility has a floating rate based upon a day commercial paper rate and our credit facility  which we currently have no outstanding borrowings on  is based on libor 
a basis point increase in market interest rates on all of our floating rate debt and our receivables facility would result in a decrease in net earnings and cash flows of approximately million per annum  holding other variables constant 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt and receivables facility  respectively 
significant commodity price fluctuations for certain commodities that we purchase could have a material impact on our results of operations 
in an attempt to manage our commodity price risk  our broadline segment enters into contracts to purchase pre established quantities of products in the normal course of business 
we have not entered into any commitments to purchase products as of december
