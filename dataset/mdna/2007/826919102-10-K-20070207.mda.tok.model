item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements 
please see the cautionary statement and risk factors above for discussions of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
our fiscal year end financial reporting periods are a or week year ending on the saturday closest to december st 
fiscal years  and were week years and ended december   december  and january   respectively 
overview we design and develop proprietary  analog intensive  mixed signal integrated circuits ics for a broad range of applications 
mixed signal ics are electronic components that convert real world analog signals  such as sound and radio waves  into digital signals that electronic products can process 
therefore  mixed signal ics are critical components in a broad range of applications in a variety of markets  including communications  consumer  industrial  automotive  medical and power management 
our major customers include agere systems  arima  chi mei  compal  lg electronics  motorola  sagem  samsung  tellabs and thomson 
our company was founded in our business has grown since our inception  as reflected by our employee headcount  which increased to at the end of fiscal  from at the end of fiscal and employees at the end of fiscal as a fabless semiconductor company  we rely on third party semiconductor fabricators in asia  and to a lesser extent the united states  to manufacture the silicon wafers that reflect our ic designs 
each wafer contains numerous die  which are cut from the wafer to create a chip for an ic 
we rely on third parties in asia to assemble  package  and  in the substantial majority of cases  test these devices and ship these units to our customers 
we have increased the portion of testing performed by such third parties  which facilitates faster delivery of products to our customers particularly those located in asia  shorter production cycle times  lower inventory requirements  lower costs and increased flexibility of test capacity 
our product set has expanded to a broad portfolio targeting mobile handset and broad based mixed signal applications 
our expertise in analog intensive  high performance  mixed signal ics enables us to develop highly differentiated solutions that address multiple markets 
for example  our silicon daa product family is optimized for the pc modem market  our isomodem family of embedded modems has been widely adopted by satellite set top box manufacturers  our proslic products have gained market share in voip residential equipment  and our aero gsm gprs transceiver family is being shipped in mobile handsets worldwide 
we continue to introduce next generation ics with added functionality and further integration 
in fiscal  we introduced the aero iied single chip edge transceiver with a digital interface  a family of highly integrated fm transmitters  a family of digital isolator products  a power over ethernet controller and expanded our mcu portfolio with the addition of new usb mcus  embedded ethernet solutions  new small form factor devices and a family of highly integrated mcus designed specifically for automotive electronics 
through acquisitions and internal development efforts  we have continued to further diversify our product portfolio 
we plan to continue to introduce products that increase the content we provide for existing applications and enable us to serve markets we do not currently address  thereby expanding our total available market opportunity 
we group our products into two categories  mobile handset products and broad based mixed signal products 
mobile handset products include our aero transceivers  aerofone single chip phone  power amplifiers pa  and to the extent incorporated into handsets  fm broadcast radio tuners and fm transmitters 
broad based mixed signal products include our silicon daa  isomodem embedded modems  proslic subscriber line interface circuits  microcontroller products  dsl afe  siphy optical physical layer transceivers  precision clock data recovery ics cdrs  xm satellite radio tuner  digital power products  power over ethernet controller  oscillators xos  voltage controlled oscillators vcxos  sirx satellite receivers  rf synthesizers and to the extent incorporated into non handset applications  fm broadcast radio tuners and fm transmitters 
during fiscal  and  samsung  represented  and of our revenues  respectively 
no other single end customer accounted for more than of our revenues in any of these years 
in addition to direct sales to customers  some of our end customers purchase products indirectly from us through distributors and contract manufacturers 
an end customer purchasing through a contract manufacturer typically instructs such contract manufacturer to obtain our products and incorporate such products with other components for sale by such contract manufacturer to the end customer 
although we actually sell the products to  and are paid by  the distributors and contract manufacturers  we refer to such end customer as our customer 
one of our distributors  edom technology  represented of our fiscal revenues 
edom and another distributor  uniquest  represented and of our fiscal revenues  and and of our fiscal revenues  respectively 
there were no other distributors or contract manufacturers that accounted for more than of our revenues in fiscal  or the percentage of our revenues derived from customers located outside of the united states was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal  which reflects our product and customer diversification and market penetration for our products  as many of our mobile handset  and increasingly  broad based mixed signal customers manufacture and design their products in asia 
all of our revenues to date have been denominated in us dollars 
we believe that a majority of our revenues will continue to be derived from customers outside of the united states 
the sales cycle for the test and evaluation of our ics can range from one month to months or more 
an additional three to six months or more are usually required before a customer ships a significant volume of devices that incorporate our ics 
due to this lengthy sales cycle  we typically experience a significant delay between incurring expenses for research and development and selling  general and administrative efforts  and the generation of corresponding sales 
consequently  if sales in any quarter do not occur when expected  expenses and inventory levels could be disproportionately high  and our operating results for that quarter and  potentially  future quarters would be adversely affected 
moreover  the amount of time between initial research and development and commercialization of a product  if ever  can be substantially longer than the sales cycle for the product 
accordingly  if we incur substantial research and development costs without developing a commercially successful product  our operating results  as well as our growth prospects  could be adversely affected 
because many of our ics are designed for use in consumer products such as personal computers  personal video recorders  set top boxes and mobile handsets  we expect that the demand for our products will be typically subject to some degree of seasonal demand resulting in increased sales in the third and fourth quarters of each year when customers place orders to meet holiday demand 
however  rapid changes in our markets and across our product areas make it difficult for us to accurately estimate the impact of seasonal factors on our business 
results of operations the following describes the line items set forth in our consolidated statements of income revenues 
revenues are generated almost exclusively by sales of our ics 
we recognize revenue on sales when all of the following criteria are met there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery of goods has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
generally  we recognize revenue from product sales direct to customers and contract manufacturers upon shipment 
certain of our sales are made to distributors under agreements allowing certain rights of return and price protection on products unsold by distributors 
accordingly  we defer the revenue and cost of revenue on such sales until the distributors sell the product to the end customer 
our products typically carry a one year replacement warranty 
replacements have been insignificant to date 
our revenues are subject to variation from period to period due to the volume of shipments made within a period and the prices we charge for our products 
the vast majority of our revenues were negotiated at prices that reflect a discount from the list prices for our products 
these discounts are made for a variety of reasons  including to establish a relationship with a new customer  as an incentive for customers to purchase products in larger volumes  to provide profit margin to our distributors who resell our products or in response to competition 
in addition  as a product matures  we expect that the average selling price for such product will decline due to the greater availability of competing products 
our ability to increase revenues in the future is dependent on increased demand for our established products and our ability to ship larger volumes of those products in response to such demand  as well as our ability to develop or acquire new products and subsequently achieve customer acceptance of newly introduced products 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues includes the cost of purchasing finished silicon wafers processed by independent foundries  costs associated with assembly  test and shipping of those products  costs of personnel and equipment associated with manufacturing support  logistics and quality assurance  costs of software royalties and amortization of purchased software  other intellectual property license costs  and certain acquired intangible assets  an allocated portion of our occupancy costs  allocable depreciation of testing equipment and leasehold improvements  and impairment charges related to certain manufacturing equipment held for sale or abandoned 
generally  we depreciate equipment over four years on a straight line basis and leasehold improvements over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the applicable lease term 
recently introduced products tend to have higher cost of revenues per unit due to initially low production volumes required by our customers and higher costs associated with new package variations 
generally  as production volumes for a product increase  unit production costs tend to decrease as our yields improve and our semiconductor fabricators  assemblers and test suppliers achieve greater economies of scale for that product 
additionally  the cost of wafer procurement and assembly and test services  which are significant components of cost of goods sold  vary cyclically with overall demand for semiconductors and our suppliers available capacity of such products and services 
research and development 
research and development expense consists primarily of personnel related expenses  including stock compensation  new product mask  wafer  packaging and test costs  external consulting and services costs  amortization of purchased software  equipment tooling  equipment depreciation  amortization of acquired intangible assets  acquired research and development resulting from acquisitions  as well as an allocated portion of our occupancy costs for such operations 
we generally depreciate our research and development equipment over four years and amortize our purchased software from computer aided design tool vendors over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the license term 
research and development activities include the design of new products and software  refinement of existing products and design of test methodologies to ensure compliance with required specifications 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel related expenses  including stock compensation  related allocable portion of our occupancy costs  sales commissions to independent sales representatives  applications engineering support  professional fees  directors and officers liability insurance  patent litigation legal fees  reserves for bad debt  costs related to relocating our headquarters and other promotional and marketing expenses 
in process research and development 
in process research and development represents acquired technology resulting from business combinations that has not achieved technological feasibility and has no alternative future use 
these costs are expensed on the date of acquisition 
interest income 
interest income reflects interest earned on average cash  cash equivalents and investment balances 
we generally invest in tax exempt short term investments 
interest expense 
interest expense consists of interest on our short and long term obligations 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net reflects foreign currency remeasurement adjustments and gains on the disposal of fixed assets 
provision for income taxes 
we accrue a provision for domestic and foreign income tax at the applicable statutory rates adjusted for non deductible expenses  including stock compensation  research and development tax credits and interest income from tax exempt short term investments 
the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  december  january  revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative in process research and development operating expenses operating income other income expense interest income interest expense other income expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income comparison of fiscal to fiscal revenues year ended december  december  change change in millions mobile handsets broad based mixed signal total mobile handsets the growth in the sales of our mobile handset products in fiscal was primarily driven by revenues from our fm broadcast radio tuners 
this growth was offset in part by a decline in revenues from our aero transceiver family of products 
unit volumes of our mobile handset products increased compared to fiscal by 
this increase was offset in part by declining average selling prices of  partially due to product transitions 
broad based mixed signal the growth in the sales of our broad based mixed signal products in fiscal was primarily driven by increased revenues from our proslic products reflecting growth in demand in the voip market  microcontroller products  and fm broadcast radio tuners for non handset applications 
such growth was offset in part by a decline in revenues from our modem products 
unit volumes of our broad based mixed signal products increased compared to fiscal by 
average selling prices increased by 
as our products become more mature  we expect to experience decreases in average selling prices in the future 
our revenues will be dependent on our ability to increase sales volumes and introduce higher priced  next generation products and product extensions 
gross profit year ended december  december  change change in millions gross profit percent of revenue the increase in gross profit in fiscal was primarily due to increased revenues and product mix 
we may experience declines in the average selling prices of our mobile handset products and certain of our broad based mixed signal products 
this downward pressure on gross profit as a percentage of revenues may be offset to the extent we are able to introduce higher margin new products and gain market share with our ics  or achieve lower production costs from our wafer foundries and third party assembly and test sub contractors 
research and development year ended december  december  change change in millions research and development percent of revenue the increase in research and development expense in fiscal was principally due to increases of million for stock compensation expense resulting from our adoption of financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas revised  share based payment  sfas r and the issuance of restricted stock awards  million for other personnel related expenses  and million for equipment depreciation  offset by a million charge for acquired research and development costs related to the acquisition of silicon magike in fiscal significant recent development projects include the aero iied single chip edge transceiver with a digital interface  a family of highly integrated fm transmitters  our power over ethernet controller and the expansion of our mcu portfolio 
these products are in the early stages of customer adoption 
we expect that research and development expense will increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to increase our staffing and associated costs to pursue additional new product development opportunities  and may fluctuate as a percentage of revenues due to changes in sales and the timing of certain expensive items related to new product development initiatives  such as engineering mask and wafer costs 
selling  general and administrative year ended december  december  change change in millions selling  general and administrative percent of revenue the increase in selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal was principally due to increases of million for stock compensation expense  million for other personnel related expenses  million related to relocating our corporate headquarters  and million of higher legal fees related to litigation 
we expect that selling  general and administrative expense will increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to expand our sales channels  marketing applications efforts and administrative infrastructure 
in process research and development in process research and development ipr d was million in fiscal the ipr d was related to our acquisitions of stackcom and silembia 
the company doesn t expect the products derived from these technologies to begin to contribute to revenues prior to fiscal there was no ipr d in fiscal interest income year ended december  december  change in millions interest income the increase in interest income in fiscal was due to a greater amount of cash and short term investments balances and to an increase in the interest rates of the underlying instruments during the period 
interest expense interest expense in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal other income expense  net other income expense  net in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal provision for income taxes year ended december  december  change in millions provision for income taxes effective tax rate the effective tax rate for fiscal was slightly lower than the effective tax rate for fiscal the increases to the effective tax rate for fiscal included the recording of stock compensation expense at a lower than average effective tax rate and state income tax expense 
these increases were offset by an increase in tax exempt interest  an increase in the foreign tax rate benefit  a decrease in the non deductible write off of acquired and in process research and development costs and an increase in research and development tax credits during fiscal the effective tax rates for each of the periods presented differ from the federal statutory rate of due to tax exempt interest income  the amount of income earned in foreign jurisdictions where the tax rate may be lower than the federal statutory rate  research and development tax credits  state income taxes and other permanent items 
the effective rate for fiscal also differs from the federal statutory rate of due to non deductible stock compensation expense and stock compensation deductible at a rate lower than the federal statutory tax rate 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal revenues year ended december  january  change change in millions mobile handsets broad based mixed signal total mobile handsets the decline in the sales of our mobile handset products in fiscal was primarily driven by declining average selling prices of our aero transceiver family of products 
average selling prices in mobile handset products decreased year over year by  partially due to product transitions 
this decrease was offset in part by a year over year increase in unit volumes of our mobile handset products 
broad based mixed signal the growth in the sales of our broad based mixed signal products in fiscal was primarily driven by increased revenues from our proslic products  and microcontroller products 
such growth was offset in part by a decline in revenue from our modem products due to declines in average selling prices and unit volumes 
unit volumes of broad based mixed signal products increased year over year by 
in addition  average selling prices in this area increased year over year by 
gross profit year ended december  january  change change in millions gross profit percent of revenue the year over year decrease in gross profit dollars in fiscal was primarily due to the decrease in revenues from our mobile handset products 
research and development year ended december  january  change change in millions research and development percent of revenue the year over year increase in research and development expense in fiscal was principally due to a million charge for acquired research and development costs in connection with our acquisition of silicon magike  increased staffing and associated occupancy and other costs to pursue new product development opportunities  and to continue to develop software and new testing methodologies for newly introduced and existing products 
selling  general and administrative year ended december  january  change change in millions selling  general and administrative percent of revenue the increase in selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal was principally attributable to an increase of approximately million for increased staffing and associated costs resulting from the geographical expansion of our sales support organization in asia and europe  million in charges related to the separation agreement with our former chief executive officer  million in charges related to the search and hiring costs of our current chief executive officer  and an increase of approximately million for increased staffing and associated costs related to the expansion of our internal information technology and services support organization 
the increase was offset in part by a million decline in sales commissions and bonuses due to a decline in our sales 
interest income year ended december  january  change in millions interest income the increase in interest income in fiscal was due to a greater amount of cash and short term investments balances during the year ended december  and due to an increase in the interest rates of the underlying instruments during fiscal interest expense interest expense was million in both fiscal and other income expense  net year ended december  january  change in millions other income expense  net other income expense  in fiscal primarily reflected gains on the sale of test equipment 
no comparable gains occurred in fiscal provision for income taxes year ended december  january  change in millions provision for income taxes effective tax rate the effective tax rate in fiscal was lower than fiscal  primarily due to the tax savings from alignment of our financial structure with our international operational structure  as well as an increase in tax exempt interest income 
the decrease was offset by the fiscal non deductible acquired research and development costs incurred in connection with our acquisition of silicon magike 
the impact of the non deductible acquired research and development costs was 
excluding this charge  the tax rate would have been 
in addition  the effective tax rates for each of the periods presented differ from the federal statutory rate of due to the amount of income earned in foreign jurisdictions where the tax rate may be lower than the federal statutory rate  the impact of research and development tax credits  tax exempt interest income and other permanent items 
business outlook we expect revenues in the first quarter of fiscal to be in the range of million to million 
furthermore  we expect our diluted net income per share to be in the range of to 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity as of december  consisted of million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
our short term investments consist primarily of tax exempt municipal bonds 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during fiscal  compared to net cash provided of million during fiscal operating cash flows during fiscal reflect our net income of million  adjustments of million for depreciation  amortization  stock compensation  acquired and in process research and development and tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options  and a net increase in the components of our working capital of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million during fiscal  compared to net cash used of million during fiscal the increase was principally due to increases of million in net purchases of short term investments and million for business acquisitions  net of cash acquired  offset by a million decrease in net purchases of other assets and property  equipment and software 
we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately to million for fiscal additionally  as part of our growth strategy  we expect to evaluate opportunities to invest in or acquire other businesses  intellectual property or technologies that would complement or expand our current offerings  expand the breadth of our markets or enhance our technical capabilities 
net cash used in financing activities was million during fiscal  compared to net cash provided of million during fiscal the decrease was principally due to payments of million for repurchases of our common stock in the recent year  offset by an increase of million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and an increase of million of excess tax benefits from such exercises 
in july  our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to million of our common stock over a twelve month period in the open market 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period total thereafter operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term obligations operating lease obligations include amounts for leased facilities 
purchase obligations include contractual arrangements in the form of purchase orders with suppliers where there is a fixed non cancelable payment schedule or minimum payments due with a reduced delivery schedule 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of sales growth  market acceptance of our products  the timing and extent of research and development projects  potential acquisitions of companies or technologies and the expansion of our sales and marketing activities 
we believe our existing cash and short term investment balances are sufficient to meet our capital requirements through at least the next months  although we could be required  or could elect  to seek additional funding prior to that time 
we may enter into acquisitions or strategic arrangements in the future which also could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
off balance sheet arrangements in march  we entered into an operating lease agreement and a related participation agreement collectively  the lease for a facility in austin  texas for our corporate headquarters 
the lease has a term of seven years 
the base rent for the term of the lease is an amount equal to the interest accruing on million at basis points over the three month libor which would be approximately million over the remaining term assuming libor averages during such term 
we have granted certain rights and remedies to the lessor in the event of certain defaults  including the right to terminate the lease  to bring suit to collect damages  and to compel us to purchase the facility 
the lease contains other customary representations  warranties  obligations  conditions  indemnification provisions and termination provisions  including covenants that we shall maintain unencumbered cash and highly rated short term investments of at least million and a ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation  amortization  lease expense and other non cash charges ebitdar over the four prior fiscal quarters of no greater than to as of december   we believe we were in compliance with all covenants of the lease 
during the term of the lease  we have an on going option to purchase the building for a total purchase price of approximately million 
alternatively  we can cause the property to be sold to third parties provided we are not in default under the lease 
we are contingently liable for the guaranteed residual value associated with this property in the event that the net sale proceeds are less than the original financed cost of the facility 
we are contingently liable for the residual value guarantee associated with the lease of approximately million 
to the extent that the net proceeds generated from the sale of the facility to a third party exceed million  we would have the right to receive a substantially all of such excess proceeds if the sale occurs prior to the end of the term or b up to approximately million of such excess proceeds if the sale occurs after the end of the term 
in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  we determined that the fair value associated with the guaranteed residual value was million 
the amount was recorded in other assets  net and long term obligations and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and is being amortized over the term of the lease 
we are required to periodically evaluate the expected fair value of the facility at the end of the lease term 
if we determine that it is estimable and probable that the expected fair value will be less than million  we will ratably accrue the loss up to a maximum of approximately million over the remaining lease term 
as of december   we have determined that a loss contingency accrual is not required 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported 
changes in facts and circumstances could have a significant impact on the resulting estimated amounts included in the financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more complex judgments and estimates 
we also have other policies that we consider to be key accounting policies  such as our policies for revenue recognition  including the deferral of revenues and cost of revenues on sales to distributors  however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record a specific allowance to reduce the net receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on a variety of factors including the age of the receivable  the current business environment and our historical experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if economic conditions worsened  additional allowances may be required in the future 
inventory valuation we assess the recoverability of inventories through the application of a set of methods  assumptions and estimates 
in determining net realizable value  we write down inventory that may be slow moving or have some form of obsolescence  including inventory that has aged more than nine months 
we also adjust the valuation of inventory when its standard cost exceeds the estimated market value 
we assess the potential for any unusual customer returns based on known quality or business issues and establish reserves based on the estimated inventory losses for scrap or non saleable material 
inventory not otherwise identified to be written down is compared to an assessment of our month forecasted demand 
the result of this methodology is compared against the product life cycle and competitive situations in the marketplace to determine the appropriateness of the resulting inventory levels 
demand for our products may fluctuate significantly over time  and actual demand and market conditions may be more or less favorable than those that we project 
in the event that actual demand is lower or market conditions are worse than originally projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
stock compensation prior to fiscal  we accounted for stock based compensation plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
sfas r requires companies to recognize the fair value of stock based compensation transactions in the statement of income 
the fair value of our stock based awards is estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes valuation calculation requires us to estimate key assumptions such as future stock price volatility  expected terms  risk free rates and dividend yield 
expected stock price volatility is based on implied volatility from traded options on our stock in the marketplace and historical volatility of our stock 
we use historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model 
the expected term of options granted is derived from an analysis of historical exercises and remaining contractual life of stock options  and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
we have never paid cash dividends  and do not currently intend to pay cash dividends  and thus have assumed a dividend yield 
if our actual experience differs significantly from the assumptions used to compute our stock based compensation cost  or if different assumptions had been used  we may have recorded too much or too little stock based compensation cost 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate of our stock grants and only recognize the expense for those shares expected to vest 
if the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different 
we had approximately million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to stock options and rsus at december  that are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on stock based compensation 
impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets we review long lived assets which are held and used  including fixed assets and purchased intangible assets  for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
such evaluations compare the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset over its expected useful life and are significantly impacted by estimates of future prices and volumes for our products  capital needs  economic trends and other factors which are inherently difficult to forecast 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  we record an impairment charge equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value determined by either a quoted market price  if any  or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique 
occasionally  we may hold certain assets for sale 
in those cases  the assets are reclassified on our balance sheet from long term to current  and the carrying value of such assets are reviewed and adjusted each period thereafter to the fair value less expected cost to sell 
we test our goodwill for impairment annually as of the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
the first step of the impairment analysis compares our fair value to our net book value 
in determining fair value  the accounting guidance allows for the use of several valuation methodologies  although it states quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair value 
if the fair value is less than the net book value  the second step of the analysis compares the implied fair value of our goodwill to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  we recognize an impairment loss equal to that excess amount 
income taxes we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences in recognition of income loss for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset 
further  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve and could result in additional assessments of income tax 
we believe adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all periods 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas will have on our financial position and results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb sfas  accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation defines the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt fin as of our fiscal year beginning december   as required 
the cumulative effect of adopting fin will be recorded in retained earnings and other accounts  as applicable 
we have not determined the effect that the adoption of fin will have on our financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial instruments include cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
our main investment objectives are the preservation of investment capital and the maximization of after tax returns on our investment portfolio 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
based on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments holdings as of december   an immediate basis point decline in the yield for such instruments would decrease our annual interest income by approximately million 
we believe that our investment policy is conservative  both in the duration of our investments and the credit quality of the investments we hold 
in march  we entered into an operating lease agreement for a facility in austin  texas for our corporate headquarters 
the lease has a term of seven years 
the base rent for the term of the lease is an amount equal to the interest accruing on million at basis points over the three month libor 
libor is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
an immediate basis point increase in the three month libor would increase our annual base rent by approximately million
