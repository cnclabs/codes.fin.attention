item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the goodyear tire rubber company is one of the world s leading manufacturers of tires and rubber products with one of the most recognizable brand names in the world and operations in most regions of the world 
we have a broad global footprint with manufacturing facilities in countries  including the united states 
we operate our business through six operating segments 
five of our operating segments represent our regional tire businesses north american tire  european union tire  eastern europe  middle east and africa tire eastern europe tire  latin american tire  asia pacific tire 
our sixth segment consists of our global engineered products business 
we have been implementing strategies to drive top line growth  reduce costs  improve our capital structure and focus on core businesses where we can achieve profitable growth 
during  while we continued to make progress in implementing these strategies  our results were adversely impacted by dramatic increases in raw material costs  a reduction in the growth of the tire industry  an increasingly competitive pricing environment  particularly in europe and latin america  lower oe suv and light truck sales in north america  and the impact of the twelve week strike by the united steelworkers 
for the year ended december   we had a net loss of million compared to net income of million in the comparable period of in addition  our total segment operating income for was million compared to billion in see result of operations segment information for additional information 
we estimate that the united steelworkers usw strike reduced our operating income by approximately million in million in north american tire and million in engineered products 
although our facilities impacted by the strike are now operating at pre strike capacity  we expect that the strike will impact results in due to reduced sales and unabsorbed fixed costs 
we estimate that segment operating income will be negatively impacted by between million to million in north american tire and million to million in engineered products 
most of this impact will occur in the first half of while the strike posed many challenges  we believe that our new master labor agreement with the usw will enable us to significantly improve the cost structure of our north american tire segment 
see union agreement and veba below for additional information 
our results were also impacted by significantly higher raw material costs 
in  raw material costs were approximately million  or  higher than in our tire segments and approximately million higher in engineered products 
while north american tire  eastern europe tire  asia pacific tire and engineered products either nearly offset or more than offset higher raw material costs with price and mix improvements  european union tire and latin american tire were unable to do so 
in  we expect raw material costs to moderate and be flat with however  as last year demonstrated  raw material costs can be extremely volatile 
in  we announced a four point cost savings plan which includes continuous improvement programs  reducing high cost manufacturing capacity  leverage our global position by increasing asian sourcing  and reducing selling  administrative and general expense 
we expect to achieve more than billion of aggregate gross cost savings from the commencement of the program through the expected cost reductions consist of from million to over million of estimated savings related to continuous improvement initiatives including safety programs  business process improvements such as six sigma and lean manufacturing  and product reformulations through december   we estimate we have achieved over million in savings under these initiatives  from million to over million of estimated savings from the reduction of high cost manufacturing capacity the announced closures of our washington  uk  upper hutt  new zealand  tyler  texas and valleyfield  quebec facilities are estimated to result in million of savings when complete  
table of contents between million to million of estimated savings related to our asian sourcing strategy of increasing our procurement of tires  raw materials  capital equipment and indirect through december   we estimate we have achieved nearly million in savings under this strategy  from million to over million of estimated savings from reductions in selling  administrative and general expenses related to initiatives including back office and warehouse consolidations and headcount reductions through december   we estimate we have achieved more than million in savings under these efforts 
execution of our four point cost savings plan and realization of the projected savings is critical to our success 
also  as described more fully in union agreement and veba below  we expect to achieve an estimated million in cost savings through from our new master labor agreement the million of these savings related to the closure of the tyler  texas facility is also included in our four point cost savings plan 
we also continued to make progress on our capital structure improvement plan in with the completion of the sale of our north american and luxembourg tire fabric operations to hyosung corporation for approximately million 
other asset sales in yielded proceeds of approximately million 
these dispositions build on our prior sales of non core businesses and assets  such as the sales of our north american farm tire business for million  indonesian rubber plantation for million  and wingtack adhesive resins business for million 
we are also continuing with our efforts to sell our engineered products business 
in november  we issued billion in unsecured notes 
a portion of the proceeds were used to repay at maturity million of notes due december   and we also plan to use the proceeds to repay million of notes maturing march  while these and other activities have improved our liquidity position  we continue to review potential divestitures of other non core businesses and assets and other financing options  including the issuance of additional equity 
at our north american dealer conference in early february we continued our transformation to a market driven  consumer focused company with the introduction in north america of the goodyear eagle f all season high performance tire with carbon fiber and the goodyear wrangler sr a with wettrac technology for the suv and light truck market 
in europe  we launched the new goodyear ultragrip extreme  which is targeted at the winter performance segment of the market  and the new goodyear eagle f asymmetric tire  which is targeted at the high performance segment 
we expect to introduce additional new tires in key market segments in our industry volume estimates for our two largest regions are as follows in north america we estimate consumer oe volume will be up approximately and commercial oe volume will be down as much as reflecting a spike in demand in advance of the effective date of regulations regarding new commercial vehicle emission standards 
north american consumer replacement volume is expected to be up approximately to  while volume for commercial replacement is expected to be flat 
in europe  consumer oe volume is expected to be flat to down and commercial oe volume is expected to be up to 
we expect consumer replacement volume to be flat to down and commercial replacement volume to be up to 
our results of operations  financial position and liquidity could be adversely affected in future periods by loss of market share or lower demand in the replacement market or the oe industry  which would result in lower levels of plant utilization and an increase in unit costs 
also  we could experience higher raw material and energy costs in future periods 
these costs  if incurred  may not be recoverable due to pricing pressures present in today s highly competitive market and we may not be able to continue improving our product mix 
our future results of operations are also dependent on our ability to successfully implement our cost reduction programs and address increasing competition from low cost manufacturers 
we are unable to predict future currency fluctuations 
sales and earnings in future periods would be unfavorably impacted if the us dollar strengthens against various foreign currencies  or if economic conditions deteriorate in the economies in which we operate 
continued volatile economic conditions or changes in government policies in emerging markets could adversely affect sales and earnings in future periods 
we may also be impacted by economic disruptions associated with global events including natural disasters  war  acts of terror and civil obstructions 
for additional factors that may impact our business and results of operations please see risk factors at page 
table of contents union agreement on december   a new master labor agreement between the usw and us was ratified by the usw membership 
the agreement covers approximately  workers at tire and engineered products plants in the united states through july we expect to achieve an estimated million in cost savings through from this agreement million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these cost savings consist of approximately million from increased productivity through lower wage rates  more cost effective benefits and improved production efficiency  approximately million from the reduction of capacity through the closure of the tyler  texas facility  and approximately million in reduced legacy costs from the implementation of an independent voluntary employee beneficiary association veba designed to provide for healthcare benefits for current and future usw retirees and the elimination of the company s liability with respect to these benefits 
the projected savings from reduced legacy costs is contingent upon our obtaining certain court and regulatory approvals 
the projected legacy cost savings is for a six month period that assumes a mid year elimination of our liability with respect to the usw retiree health care benefits through implementation of the veba 
these cost savings will be offset by approximately million of additional costs resulting from other terms of the agreement  primarily the restoration of pension service credit 
we have also committed to make at least million in capital expenditures in usw represented plants over the term of the agreement 
veba as part of the new master labor agreement  we entered into a memorandum of understanding with the usw regarding the establishment of an independent voluntary employees beneficiary association veba intended to provide healthcare benefits for current and future usw retirees 
as a result  we expect to be able to eliminate our post retirement healthcare opeb liability related to such benefits 
the memorandum of understanding followed substantial negotiations between the usw and us 
we have committed to contribute to the veba billion  which will consist of at least million in cash and an additional million to be funded in cash or shares of our common stock at our option 
if we contribute shares of our common stock  the number of shares to be contributed would be based on the volume weighted average prices of our common stock for a period near the time of the district court s approval of the class settlement or the time of contribution if we exercise our right to delay the stock contribution  whichever would maximize the number of shares to be contributed 
if we elect to fund the veba with shares of common stock  the veba will receive registered shares 
the veba will have the right to sell its shares in any equity offering we may make and  if it chooses not to do so  will be required to observe customary lock up restrictions on the sale of its shares for a period following completion of our offering 
the veba will be required to vote its shares of our common stock in the same proportion as all other outstanding shares 
the establishment of the veba is conditioned upon us district court approval of a settlement of a declaratory judgment action to be filed by the usw pursuant to the memorandum of understanding 
the usw and we will seek the settlement of this action pursuant to a final judgment approving a non opt out class wide settlement covering current usw retirees that confirms the fairness and structure of the veba 
we plan to make our contributions to the veba following the district court s approval of this settlement 
if the veba is not approved by the district court or if the approval of the district court is subsequently reversed  the master labor agreement may be terminated by either us or the usw  and negotiations may be reopened on the entirety of the master labor agreement 
in addition  if we do not receive the approval of the us department of labor for any contribution of our common stock to the veba  we have the right to terminate the master labor agreement and reopen negotiations 
if negotiations are reopened  we might be unable to achieve the cost reductions we expect to receive from the master labor agreement 

table of contents despite making contributions to the veba  we will not be able to remove our liability for usw retiree healthcare benefits approximately billion at december  from our balance sheet until this settlement has received final judicial approval including the exhaustion of all appeals  if any and  if we have elected to contribute million of our common stock  until we have obtained approval of the stock contribution from the us department of labor 
if the veba is funded but we are unable to remove this liability from our balance sheet eg  an approval of the district court is reversed on appeal  we will not be able to terminate the veba and recover our contributions  rather  the funds in the veba shall be used to pay for usw retiree health benefits and we will remain liable to pay those benefits 
however  once we have made our contributions to the veba  all necessary final judicial and regulatory approvals have been obtained and our opeb liability for usw retiree healthcare benefits has been eliminated  our opeb expense is projected to be reduced by approximately million per year based on our most recent annual actuarial estimates 
results of operations consolidated all per share amounts are diluted compared to net sales net sales in were billion  increasing billion or compared to a net loss of million  or per share  was recorded in compared to net income of million  or per share in net sales in for our tire segments were impacted favorably by price and product mix by approximately  million  increased sales from our other tire related businesses of approximately million  primarily in north american tire  and favorable currency translation of approximately million  primarily in european union tire 
partially offsetting these were lower volume of approximately million  primarily in north american tire  approximately million of lower sales as a result of the usw strike  and approximately million of sales related to north american tire divestitures 
sales also decreased approximately million in our engineered products division  primarily related to lower volume of approximately million and approximately million of lower sales as a result of the usw strike 
these were partially offset by improved price and mix of approximately million and favorable currency translation of approximately million 
the following table presents our tire unit sales for the periods indicated year ended december  in millions of tires change replacement units north american tire us and canada international total oe units north american tire us and canada international total goodyear worldwide tire units worldwide replacement unit sales in decreased from due primarily to an overall decline in the consumer replacement market as well as strategic share reduction in the lower value segment in north american tire 
oe unit sales in decreased from due primarily to north american tire  driven by lower vehicle production  and european union tire due to our selective fitment strategy and a weak oe consumer market  offset by increased unit sales in latin american tire due to increased market share 
the usw strike also decreased units by million 

table of contents cost of goods sold cost of goods sold cgs was billion in  an increase of billion  or compared to the period 
cgs increased to of sales in compared to in cgs for our tire segments in increased due to higher raw material costs of approximately million  and approximately million of increased costs related to other tire related businesses 
product mix related manufacturing cost increases of approximately million  primarily related to north american tire and european union tire  approximately million of higher conversion costs mainly in north american tire  and foreign currency translation of approximately million  primarily related to european union tire also increased cgs 
also increasing cgs was approximately million of accelerated depreciation and asset impairment charges  primarily related to the closure of the washington  united kingdom  upper hutt  new zealand  casablanca  morocco and tyler  texas facilities 
partially offsetting these increases were lower volume of approximately million  primarily related to north american tire  divestitures in of approximately million  lower depreciation expense of approximately million as a result of the increased estimated useful lives of our tire mold equipment  and approximately million as a result of a favorable settlement with a raw material supplier 
also reducing cgs was savings from rationalization plans of approximately million and a pension plan curtailment gain in brazil of approximately million 
the usw strike decreased volume and product mix by approximately million  and increased conversion costs and costs related to other tire related businesses by approximately million 
also included in costs were million of hurricane related expenses 
cgs also decreased by million in the engineered products division due to lower volume of approximately million  favorable settlements with raw material suppliers of approximately million  and savings from rationalization plans of approximately million  which were partially offset by increased raw material costs of million  unfavorable foreign currency translation of million 
the usw strike impact on epd resulted in higher costs of million and lower volume of approximately million 
research and development expenditures are expensed in cgs as incurred and were million in  compared to million in selling  administrative and general expense selling  administrative and general expense sag was billion in  a decrease of million or 
sag in was of sales  compared to in the decrease in our tire segments was driven primarily by lower advertising expenses of approximately million  primarily in the european union and north american tire segments  savings from rationalization programs of approximately million  and lower wage and benefit expenses of approximately million  partially offset by stock based compensation expense of approximately million 
also included approximately million of costs related to hurricanes 
these decreases were partially offset by unfavorable currency translation of approximately million  higher general and product liability expenses of approximately million  primarily in north american tire  and approximately million of accelerated depreciation and asset impairment charges primarily related to a plant closure in morocco 
also increasing sag was approximately million of the impact of the usw strike 
epd s sag was relatively flat year over year 
interest expense interest expense was million  an increase of million during as compared to the increase was primarily due to an increase in average debt levels due to financing arrangements entered into partly as a result of the usw strike 
other income and expense other income and expense was million of income in  an increase of million compared to million of expense in the increase in income was primarily due to lower amortization of commitment fees and other debt related costs of approximately million  and increased interest income by approximately million from short term investments of the additional cash balances resulting from increased borrowings 
in there were gains of approximately million and million  respectively  from the sale of a capital lease in the european union and the fabric business  compared to a net loss of approximately million in from the 
table of contents sale of the farm tire and wingtack businesses 
also included the reversal of a liability of approximately million in brazil subsequent to a favorable court ruling 
these gains were partially offset by approximately million in additional expenses related to general and product liabilities  primarily related to asbestos and a decline of approximately million in net insurance settlement gains

the difference between our effective tax rate and the us statutory rate was due primarily to our continuing to maintain a full valuation allowance against our net federal and state deferred tax assets and the net favorable adjustments discussed below 
income tax expense in and includes net favorable tax adjustments totaling million and million  respectively 
the adjustment for related primarily to the resolution of an uncertain tax position regarding a reorganization of certain legal entities in  which was partially offset by a charge of million to establish a foreign valuation allowance  attributable to a rationalization plan 
the favorable adjustment for related primarily to the release of certain foreign valuation allowances 
our losses in certain foreign locations in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require us to maintain a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets in these foreign locations 
however  if our income projections for future periods are realized  it is reasonably possible that these earnings could provide sufficient positive evidence to require release of all  or a portion  of these valuation allowances as early as the second half of resulting in one time tax benefits of up to million million net of minority interests in net income of subsidiaries

court rulings on our cases or similar cases could impact our assessment of the probability and estimate of our loss  which could have an impact on our reported results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
we record insurance recovery receivables related to our litigation claims when it is probable that we will receive reimbursement from the insurer 
specifically  we are a defendant in numerous lawsuits alleging various asbestos related personal injuries purported to result from alleged exposure to asbestos in certain rubber encapsulated products or aircraft braking systems manufactured by us in the past  or in certain of our facilities 
typically  these lawsuits have been brought against multiple defendants in federal and state courts 
we engage an independent asbestos valuation firm to review our existing reserves for pending claims  provide a reasonable estimate of the liability associated with unasserted asbestos claims  and determine our receivables from probable insurance recoveries 
a significant assumption in our estimated liability is the period over which the liability can be reasonably estimated 
due to the difficulties in making these estimates  analysis based on new data and or changed circumstances arising in the future could result in an increase in the recorded obligation in an amount that cannot be reasonably estimated  and that increase could be significant 
we had recorded liabilities for both asserted and unasserted claims  inclusive of defense costs  totaling million at december  and million at december  the portion of the liability associated with unasserted asbestos claims and related defense costs was million at december  and million at december  we maintain primary insurance coverage under coverage in place agreements as well as excess liability insurance with respect to asbestos liabilities 
we record a receivable with respect to such policies when we determine that recovery is probable and we can reasonably estimate the amount of a particular recovery 
this determination is based on consultation with our outside legal counsel and giving consideration to relevant factors  including the ongoing legal proceedings with certain of our excess coverage insurance carriers  their financial viability  their legal obligations and other pertinent facts 
the valuation firm also assisted us in valuing receivables recorded for probable insurance recoveries 
based upon the model employed by the valuation firm  as of december   i we had recorded a receivable related to asbestos claims of million  compared to million at december   and ii we expect that approximately of asbestos claim related losses would be recoverable up to our accessible policy limits 
the receivable recorded consists of an amount we expect to collect under coverage in place agreements with certain primary carriers as well as an amount we believe is probable of recovery from certain of our excess coverage insurance carriers 
of this amount  million was included in current assets as part of accounts and notes receivable at december  and in addition to our asbestos claims  we are a defendant in various lawsuits related to our entran ii rubber hose product 
during  we entered into a settlement agreement to address a substantial portion of our entran ii liabilities 
the claims associated with the plaintiffs that opted not to participate in the settlement will be evaluated in a manner consistent with our other litigation claims 
we had recorded liabilities related to entran ii claims totaling million at december  and million at december  workers compensation 
we recorded liabilities  on a discounted basis  totaling million and million for anticipated costs related to workers compensation at december  and  respectively 
the costs include an estimate of expected settlements on pending claims  defense costs and a provision for claims incurred but not reported 
these estimates are based on our assessment of potential liability using an analysis of available 
table of contents information with respect to pending claims  historical experience  and current cost trends 
the amount of our ultimate liability in respect of these matters may differ from these estimates 
we periodically update  at least annually  our loss development factors based on actuarial analyses 
at december   the liability was discounted using the risk free rate of return

recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized under sfas rather  these assets must be tested annually for impairment or more frequently if an indicator of impairment is present 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill be allocated to various reporting units  which are either at the operating segment level or one reporting level below the operating segment 
we have determined our reporting units to be consistent with our operating segments as determined under sfas disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
our reporting units for purposes of applying the provisions of sfas are comprised of six strategic business units north american tire  european union tire  eastern europe  middle east and africa tire  latin american tire  asia pacific tire  and engineered products  which is managed on a global basis 
goodwill is allocated to these reporting units based on the original purchase price allocation for acquisitions within the various reporting units 
during  there have been no changes to our reporting units or in the manner to which goodwill was allocated 
for purposes of our annual impairment testing  which is conducted as of july each year  we determine the estimated fair values of our reporting units using a valuation methodology based upon an ebitda multiple using comparable companies 
the ebitda multiple is adjusted if necessary to reflect local market conditions and recent transactions 
the ebitda of the reporting units are adjusted to exclude certain non recurring or unusual items and corporate charges 
ebitda is based upon a combination of historical and forecasted results 
significant decreases in ebitda in future periods could be an indication of a potential impairment 
additionally  valuation multiples of comparable companies would have to decline in excess of to indicate a potential goodwill impairment 
goodwill totaled million and other intangible assets with indefinite lives totaled million at december  the valuation indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives 
in addition  there were no events or circumstances that indicated the impairment test should be performed at december  deferred tax asset valuation allowance and uncertain income tax positions 
at december  and  we had valuation allowances aggregating billion and billion  respectively  against all of our net federal and state and certain of our foreign net deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of sfas which requires an assessment of both negative and positive evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance 
in accordance with sfas  evidence  such as operating results during the most recent three year period  is given more weight than our expectations of future profitability  which are inherently uncertain 
our losses in the us  and certain foreign locations in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance against our net federal  state and certain of our foreign deferred tax assets under sfas we intend to maintain a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support realization of such assets 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be required 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
we also recognize tax benefits to the extent that it is probable that our positions will be sustained when challenged by the taxing authorities 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established  or are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities  our effective tax rate in a given period could be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement would require cash payments and result in an 
table of contents increase in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
effective january   we will be required to recognize tax benefits in accordance with the provisions of fin no 
for additional information regarding fin refer to recently issued accounting standards in note pensions and other postretirement benefits 
our recorded liability for pensions and postretirement benefits other than pensions is based on a number of assumptions  including life expectancies  retirement rates  discount rates  long term rates of return on plan assets  future compensation levels  future health care costs  and maximum company covered benefit costs 
certain of these assumptions are determined with the assistance of independent actuaries 
assumptions about life expectancies  retirement rates  future compensation levels and future health care costs are based on past experience and anticipated future trends  including an assumption about inflation 
the discount rate for our us plans is derived from a portfolio of corporate bonds from issuers rated aa or higher by standard poor s as of december and is reviewed annually 
the total cash flows provided by the portfolio are similar to the timing of our expected benefit payment cash flows 
the long term rate of return on plan assets is based on the compound annualized return of our us pension fund over periods of years or more  asset class return expectations and long term inflation 
these assumptions are regularly reviewed and revised when appropriate  and changes in one or more of them could affect the amount of our recorded net expenses for these benefits 
other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age  mortality and turnover are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect our experience and expectations for the future 
if the actual experience differs from expectations  our financial position  results of operations and liquidity in future periods could be affected 
the discount rate used in determining the total liability for our us pension and other postretirement plans was at december   compared to  and for december   and  respectively 
the increase in the rate at december  was due primarily to higher interest rates on highly rated corporate bonds 
interest cost included in our net periodic pension cost was million in  compared to million in and million in although the reduction in the discount rate favorably affected interest cost in our net periodic pension cost in those years  it also resulted in an increase in the liability on which the interest cost was based 
interest cost included in our worldwide net periodic postretirement benefit cost was million in  compared to million in and million in interest cost was lower in as a result of the reduction in the postretirement liability due to actuarial gains 
the weighted average remaining service period for employees covered by our us plans is approximately years

table of contents although we experienced an increase in our us discount rate at the end of  a large portion of the unrecognized actuarial loss of  million in our us pension plans as of december  is a result of the overall decline in us discount rates over time 
for purposes of determining us net periodic pension expense  our funded status was such that we recognized million of the unrecognized actuarial loss in we will recognize approximately million of unrecognized actuarial losses in given no change to the assumptions at our december  measurement  actuarial loss recognition will remain at an amount near that to be recognized in over the next few years before it begins to gradually decline

the service cost of our us pension plans increased from million in  to million in the expense reflects the suspension of pension service credit agreed to in our labor contract 
this suspension expired on november  although we experienced an increase in our us discount rate at the end of  a large portion of the unrecognized actuarial loss of million in our worldwide postretirement plans as of december  is a result of the overall decline in us discount rates over time 
the unrecognized actuarial loss decreased from primarily due to an actuarial gain

table of contents consolidated ebitda per credit agreements under our first lien and european credit facilities we are not permitted to fall below a ratio of to of consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense as such terms are defined in each of the relevant credit facilities for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters 
in addition  our ratio of consolidated net secured indebtedness to consolidated ebitda as such terms are defined in each of the relevant credit facilities is not permitted to be greater than to at the end of any fiscal quarter 
consolidated ebitda is a non gaap financial measure that is presented not as a measure of operating results  but rather as a measure under our debt covenants 
it should not be construed as an alternative to either i income from operations or ii cash flows from operating activities 
our failure to comply with the financial covenants in our credit facilities could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations 
accordingly  we believe that the presentation of consolidated ebitda will provide investors with information needed to assess our ability to continue to comply with these covenants 
the following table presents the calculation of ebitda and consolidated ebitda for the periods indicated 
other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently than we do

as a result of these ratings and other related events  we believe that our access to capital markets may be limited 
unless our debt credit ratings and operating performance improve  our access to the credit markets in the future may be limited 
moreover  a reduction in our credit ratings would further increase the cost of any financing initiatives we may pursue 
a rating reflects only the view of a rating agency  and is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities 
any rating can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances warrant such a change 
potential future financings in addition to our previous financing activities  we plan to undertake additional financing actions which could include restructuring bank debt or a capital markets transaction  possibly including the issuance of additional equity 
given the challenges that we face and the uncertainties of the market conditions  access to the capital markets cannot be assured 
future liquidity requirements also may make it necessary for us to incur additional debt 
however  a substantial portion of our assets is already subject to liens securing our indebtedness 
as a result  we are limited in our ability to pledge our remaining assets as security for additional secured indebtedness 
in addition  no assurance can be given as to our ability to raise additional unsecured debt 
dividends we have not paid a cash dividend since under our primary credit facilities we are permitted to pay dividends on our common stock of million or less in any fiscal year 
this limit increases to million in any fiscal year if moody s senior implied rating and standard poor s s p corporate rating improve to ba or better and bb or better  respectively

the obligation related to pension benefits is actuarially determined and is reflective of obligations as of december  although subject to change  the amounts set forth in the table for the st year and the nd year represent the midpoint of the range of our estimated minimum funding requirements for domestic defined benefit pension plans under current erisa law  and the midpoint of the range of our expected contributions to our funded non us pension plans 
the current estimate for our domestic defined benefit plans does not include the provisions of irs regulations released february  related to mandated mortality assumptions to be used for we are not currently able to estimate the impact the mandated mortality table 
table of contents will have on our contributions 
for years after  the amounts shown in the table represent the midpoint of the range of our estimated minimum funding requirements for our domestic defined benefit pension plans  and do not include estimates for contributions to our funded non us pension plans 
the expected contributions for our domestic plans are based upon a number of assumptions  including an erisa liability interest rate of for  for  for  for  and for  and plan asset returns of for and beyond 
future contributions are also effected by other factors such as future interest rate levels  the amount and timing of asset returns  and how contributions in excess of the minimum requirements could impact the amounts and timing of future contributions 
the payments presented above are expected payments for the next years 
the payments for other postretirement benefits reflect the estimated benefit payments of the plans using the provisions currently in effect 
under the relevant summary plan descriptions or plan documents we have the right to modify or terminate the plans 
the obligation related to other postretirement benefits is actuarially determined on an annual basis 
the estimated payments have been reduced to reflect the provisions of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of these amounts will be reduced significantly provided the proposed settlement with the usw regarding retiree healthcare becomes effective

the present value of anticipated claims payments for workers compensation is million 
binding commitments are for our normal operations and are related primarily to obligations to acquire land  buildings and equipment 
in addition  binding commitments includes obligations to purchase raw materials through short term supply contracts at fixed prices or at formula prices related to market prices or negotiated prices 
additional other long term liabilities include items such as income taxes  general and product liabilities  environmental liabilities and miscellaneous other long term liabilities 
these other liabilities are not contractual obligations by nature 
we cannot  with any degree of reliability  determine the years in which these liabilities might ultimately be settled 
accordingly  these other long term liabilities are not included in the above table 
in addition  the following contingent contractual obligations  the amounts of which cannot be estimated  are not included in the table above the terms and conditions of our global alliance with sumitomo as set forth in the umbrella agreement between sumitomo and us provide for certain minority exit rights available to sumitomo commencing in in addition  the occurrence of certain other events enumerated in the umbrella agreement  including certain bankruptcy events or changes in our control  could trigger a right of sumitomo to require us to purchase these interests immediately 
sumitomo s exit rights  in the unlikely event of exercise  could require us to make a substantial payment to acquire sumitomo s interest in the alliance 
pursuant to certain long term agreements  we shall purchase minimum amounts of a raw material at agreed upon base prices that are subject to periodic adjustments for changes in raw material costs and market price adjustments 
we do not engage in the trading of commodity contracts or any related derivative contracts

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we continuously monitor our fixed and floating rate debt mix 
within defined limitations  we manage the mix using refinancing and unleveraged interest rate swaps 
we will enter into fixed and floating interest rate swaps to alter our exposure to the impact of changing interest rates on consolidated results of operations and future cash outflows for interest 
fixed rate swaps are used to reduce our risk of increased interest costs during periods of rising interest rates  and are normally designated as cash flow hedges 
floating rate swaps are used to convert the fixed rates of long term borrowings into short term variable rates  and are normally designated as fair value hedges 
interest rate swap contracts are thus used to separate interest rate risk management from debt funding decisions 
at december   of our debt was at variable interest rates averaging compared to at an average rate of at december  the increase in the average variable interest rate was driven by increases in the index rates associated with our variable rate debt 
we also have from time to time entered into interest rate lock contracts to hedge the risk free component of anticipated debt issuances 
as a result of credit ratings actions and other related events  our access to these instruments may be limited 
the following table presents information on interest rate swap contracts at december dollars in millions floating rate contracts notional principal amount pay variable libor receive fixed rate average years to maturity fair value asset pro forma fair value asset 
table of contents the pro forma fair value assumes a increase in variable market interest rates at december of each year  and reflects the estimated fair value of contracts outstanding at that date under that assumption

the sensitivity of our interest rate contracts and fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates was determined with a valuation model based upon net modified duration analysis 
the model assumes a parallel shift in the interest rate yield curve 
the precision of the model decreases as the assumed change in interest rates increases 
foreign currency exchange risk we enter into foreign currency contracts in order to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on consolidated results of operations and future foreign currency denominated cash flows 
these contracts reduce exposure to currency movements affecting existing foreign currency denominated assets  liabilities  firm commitments and forecasted transactions resulting primarily from trade receivables and payables  equipment acquisitions  intercompany loans and royalty agreements and forecasted purchases and sales 
in addition  the principal and interest on our swiss franc bonds were hedged by currency swap agreements until they matured in march  as were million of the euro notes until they matured in june contracts hedging the swiss franc bonds were designated as cash flow hedges until they matured in march  as were contracts hedging million of the euro notes until they matured in june contracts hedging short term trade receivables and payables normally have no hedging designation
