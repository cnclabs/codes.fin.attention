item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview iris international  inc consists of three operating units in two business segments as determined in accordance with sfas our largest unit  iris diagnostics division  designs  manufactures and markets in vitro diagnostics ivd systems  consumables and supplies for urinalysis 
our sample processing division markets small centrifuges and other processing equipment and accessories for rapid specimen processing  and our advanced digital imaging and research llc adir subsidiary assists in the advancement of proprietary imaging technology while conducting government sponsored research and contract development in imaging and pattern recognition 
with the acquisition imd  we acquired significant core technology for an ultra sensitive immunoassay process and novel in vitro separation and concentration process as well as in process research and development for bacteria and cancer detection applications 
we generate revenues primarily from sales of ivd instruments  ivd consumables and service and sample processing instruments and supplies 
revenues from ivd instruments include sales of urine microscopy and chemistry analyzers manufactured by us and urine chemistry analyzers sourced from a japanese manufacturer 
we sell the urine microscopy analyzers and the ichem  our new semi automated chemistry analyzer introduced in the third quarter of on a global basis and distribute the other chemistry analyzers domestically only 
consumables include products such as chemical reagents and urine test strips 
service revenues are derived primarily from annual service contracts purchased by our domestic customers after the initial year of sale  which is covered by product warranties spare parts from international customers 
once the analyzers are installed  we generate recurring revenue from sales of consumables 
consumable and service revenue will continue to expand as the installed base of related instruments increases 
revenue is also generated from sales of sample processing instruments and related supplies  which primarily consists of centrifuge systems  dna processing workstations and blood analysis products 
domestic sales of our automated urinalysis systems are direct to the customer through our sales force 
with the introduction of our first proprietary chemistry products  the ichem and vchem strips  we implemented a distribution network consisting of the major medical device distributors in the us to sell to physician office laboratories and other smaller volume laboratories 
in addition  med tech associates  a professional manufacturer s representation organization with nationwide coverage  is providing field level product sales support activities for our chemistry products 
international sales  with the exception of france  are through independent distributors 
sales in france are direct to end use customers 
international sales represented of consolidated revenues in as compared to in since the launch of our iq product line  we have increased our sales efforts in the international marketplace  with the ultimate goal of balancing our urinalysis business between domestic and international markets 
since international sales are made through independent distributors  gross profit margin is lower than domestic sales of the same products  but we do not incur sales and marketing costs for such sales 
our sample processing products are sold worldwide through distributors 
on april  we acquired the stock of imd formerly leucadia technologies  inc  a development stage molecular diagnostics company 
with this acquisition we acquired significant core technology for an ultra sensitive immunoassay process and novel in vitro separation and concentration process as well as in process research and development for bacteria and cancer detection applications 
pursuant to the imd acquisition agreement  we paid million of cash   shares of iris common stock  valued at million  deferred stock units for  shares of iris common stock valued at  and  of transaction fees 
the iris common stock and deferred stock units were valued based on the average closing market price of iris common stock a few days before and a few days following the acquisition 
in addition  we will issue up to  shares of iris common stock and deferred stock units for  shares of iris common stock as earn out consideration if certain regulatory and sales milestones are achieved 

table of contents on june   we completed the acquisition of the assets primarily technology and inventory of the urinalysis business of quidel corporation 
our total acquisition cost amounted to  with this acquisition  we acquired significant core technology and know how in urine chemistry strips  patents and trademarks  product designs  a strip manufacturing facility in germany and a semi automated urine chemistry analyzer that will enable us to offer a more complete product line internationally 
we make significant investments in research and development for new products and enhancements to existing products 
we internally fund research and development programs  and through adir  we also receive government grants to fund various research activities 
the following table summarizes product technology expenditures for the periods indicated in thousands total product technology expenditures during year less amounts capitalized during year to software development costs as reported in the consolidated statements of cash flow less amounts reimbursed through grants for government sponsored research and development research and development expense as reported in the consolidated statements of operations year in review the year ended december  turned into another transition year for our company with significant investments in infrastructure and new technology necessary to support and expand our business at a fast and sustained pace for future periods and to strengthen our global competitive position 
this year s results were affected by certain large and special charges related to the accounting of acquisitions  transition of senior executives  bad debt and inventory write downs 
in addition  the company expended over million for an acquisition and capital expenditures during the year  with operating cash flows showing a substantial increase to million up from million in the prior year 
in  with the acquisition of a product line and a dry chemistry strip manufacturing facility in germany  we decided to make a significant investment in the urine chemistry segment in order to develop a proprietary line of urine chemistry products 
in  significant resources were allocated to improve the acquired semi automated product line and to initiate the development of an expanded proprietary urine product lines covering both the automated and clia waived urine chemistry segments 
in addition  we acquired a molecular diagnostics company  leucadia technologies to enable new products in the field of urine bacteria  rare cell detection  cancer diagnostics and infectious diseases 
as a result of the acquisition  r d expenses increased in by approximately million  including a non tax deductible  non cash charge of million related to the allocation of a portion of the purchase price to in process research and development 
during the year we also implemented sfas r that resulted in additional stock based compensation expense of approximately million 
our results for amounted to a net loss of  or per share on revenues of million with gross profits increasing over the prior year to million 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles and our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations require us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we regularly discuss with our audit committee the basis of our estimates 
actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition revenues are primarily derived from the sale of ivd instruments  sales of consumable supplies and services for ivd systems as well as sales of sample processing instruments and related supplies 
revenue is recognized once all of the following conditions have been met a an authorized purchase order has been received in writing with a fixed and determinable sales price  b customer credit worthiness has been established  and c delivery of the product based on shipping terms 
the majority of domestic ivd instrument sales generally include installation and training to be performed 
revenue is recorded in accordance with the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf statement revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables and staff accounting bulletin sab revenue recognition in financial statements which generally requires revenue earned on product sales involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of those elements if sold separately 
multiple elements of certain domestic product sales include ivd instruments  training  consumables and service 
accordingly  we allocate revenue to each element in a multiple element arrangement based on the element s respective fair value  with the fair value determined by the price charged when that element is sold separately and specifically defined in a quotation or contract 
a portion of our revenues are derived from sale type leases as we provide lease financing to certain customers that purchase our diagnostic instruments 
leases under these arrangements are classified as sales type leases 
these leases typically have terms of five years 
revenue from sales type leases is recognized when collectibility of the minimum lease payments is reasonably predictable and no important uncertainties surround the amount of unreimbursable costs yet to be incurred by us as lessor under the lease 
the minimum lease payments that accrue to our benefit as lessor are recorded as the gross investment in the lease 
the difference between the gross investment in the lease and the sum of the present value of the minimum lease payments and unguaranteed residual value  accruing to our benefit as lessor  are recorded as unearned income 
we have certain government contracts with cancellation clauses or renewal provisions that are generally required by law  such as those dependant on fiscal funding outside of a governmental unit s control  those that can be cancelled if deemed in the tax payers best interest or those that must be renewed each fiscal year  given limitations that may exist on multi year contracts that are imposed by statute 
under these circumstances and in accordance with the relevant accounting literature  as well as considering our historical experience  a thorough evaluation of these contracts is performed to assess whether cancellation is remote or whether exercise of the renewal option is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenues from service contracts ratably over the term of the service period  which typically ranges from twelve to sixty months 
payments for service contracts are generally received in advance 
deferred revenue represents the revenues to be recognized over the remaining term of the service contracts 
inventory valuation we value inventories at the lower of cost or market value on a first in  first out basis 
provision for potentially obsolete or slow moving inventory is made based on management s analysis of inventory levels and future sales forecasts 
we recognize that although we have introduced our new iq product line of analyzers  an installed based of our legacy products still exist 
we maintain a base supply of service parts for these products  a portion of which is classified as a long term asset on our balance sheet 
management will periodically review the carrying value of such parts to ensure that they continue to equal or not exceed net realizable value 
goodwill and core technology our intangible assets consist of goodwill  which is not being amortized and core technology  which is being amortized over its useful life of years 
all intangible assets are subject to impairment tests on an annual or periodic basis 
goodwill is evaluated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
based on various analyses  including cash flow and profitability projections 
the analysis necessarily involves significant management judgment to evaluate the capacity of an acquired business to perform within projections 
core technology is evaluated for impairment using the methodology set forth in sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

recoverability of these assets is assessed only when events have occurred that may give rise to a potential impairment 
when a potential impairment has been identified  forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operations to which the asset relates are compared to the current carrying value of the long lived assets present in that operation 
if such cash flows are less than such carrying amounts  long lived assets  including such intangibles  are written down to their respective fair values 
at december   we evaluated goodwill and determined that fair value had not decreased below carrying value and no adjustment to impair goodwill was necessary in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
substantially all of the goodwill resides in the imd reporting unit 

table of contents capitalized software we capitalize software development costs in connection with our development of our urine analyzers in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the cost of capitalized software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
we capitalize software development costs once technological feasibility is established and such costs are determined to be recoverable against future revenues 
capitalized software development costs are expensed to cost of sales over periods up to five years 
when  in management s estimate  future revenues will not be sufficient to recover previously capitalized software development costs  we will expense such items as additional software development amortization in the period the impairment is identified 
such adjustments are normally attributable to changes in market conditions or product quality considerations 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
income tax expense represents the tax payable for the period and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
stock based compensation effective january  we implemented the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  that establishes standards for accounting for transactions in which a company exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services or incurs a liability in exchange for goods and services that is based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
the primary focus of this pronouncement is on issuing share based payments for services provided by employees 
this pronouncement also requires recognition of compensation expense for new equity instruments awarded or for modifications  cancellations or repurchases of existing awards starting january  compensation expense for new equity awards  in most cases  will be based on the fair value of the stock on the date of grant and will be recognized over the vesting service period 
an award of a liability instrument  as defined by this pronouncement  will initially be recorded at fair value and will be adjusted each reporting period to the new fair value through the date of settlement 
under the terms of this pronouncement  we began to expense equity awards using a modified version of prospective application 
under that transition method  compensation cost is recognized on or after the required effective date for the portion of outstanding awards  for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered  based on the fair value of those awards on their respective grant dates 
prior to implementation of sfas r  we accounted for stock based compensation using the intrinsic method provided by accounting principles board opinion no 
on october   our board of directors passed a resolution whereby all outstanding employee stock options to be vested and we recorded a charge of  representing an estimate for employee turnover during the remaining vesting period 
the purpose of this action was to mitigate the effect on future earnings of implementing sfas r 
future periods will be impacted by the provisions of sfas r  the extent to which stock options granted during and additional options  if any  to be granted in future periods

included in the domestic increase were several multi site multi unit orders awarded by major laboratories and hospital chains in the second half of domestically  we sell the iq microscopy analyzers separately or combined with a chemistry analyzer  which we acquire from a japanese 
table of contents company 
the majority of domestic sales are sold as combined systems 
internationally  we sell our iq microscopy analyzer separately or with our semi automated chemistry analyzer  as we do not have the distribution rights for the fully automated chemistry analyzer 
we plan on offering a fully automated chemistry analyzer that we are developing internally  internationally by the end of overall gross profit margins decreased slightly from in to in the gross profit margin of our ivd instruments increased to in up from in primarily due to increased sales of the iq sprint and the mix of instruments sold domestically versus internationally 
the gross margin of our ivd consumables and services decreased to during compared to in the decrease resulted from the cost of our chemistry strip manufacturing operation acquired in june which is currently operating below capacity as well as increased costs associated with additional personnel for domestic service in order to improve customer service response times and a significant increase in the percentage of iq analyzers under warranty 
our german strip manufacturing facility is expected to continue to operate below capacity until we launch our new automated urine chemistry analyzer later this year

the increase includes severance and other costs relating to the cfo transitions during amounting to approximately  higher employee salaries and related benefits of  increased stock based compensation costs of  primarily associated with the adoption of sfas r  higher professional fees relating to auditing services and compliance with sarbanes oxley act section amounting to  and an increase in bad debt reserves of  research and development expense amounted to million during as compared to million in the prior year 
as a result of our acquisition of imd on april   we acquired significant in process research and development expense for bacteria and cancer detection applications which we valued at million and is included in our research and development expense 
the increase in research and development expense also includes approximately million relating to molecular diagnostics programs initiated with our acquisition of leucadia technologies and approximately  of incremental development expenses primarily related to the design of our new automated urine chemistry analyzer for the international market 
research and development expenses were net of reimbursed costs received from governmental research and development grants for our adir subsidiary  which amounted to million and million during and interest income during amounted to million  a  increase over and relates to our continued investment of excess cash during the year as well as interest earned on lease financing from the sale of instruments to customers 
our sales type lease financings increased to million at december  compared to million the prior year 
income tax expense during the year amounted to of pre tax income as compared to during the prior year 
the increase in the income tax provision results from the exclusion of million for purchased in process research and development not deductible for tax purposes 
the tax provision continues to be primarily a non cash expense  since we have significant deferred tax assets relating to tax loss carryforwards 
our tax loss carryforward amounts to approximately million as of december  in addition  we also have research and development and other tax credit carryovers totaling million  net of valuation allowances

income tax expense during the year amounted to of pre tax income as compared to 
the improvement resulted primarily from tax credits realized from research and development activities 
the tax provision is a non cash item  since we have significant deferred tax assets  primarily relating to tax loss carryforwards 
contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments the following table aggregates our expected minimum contractual obligations and commitments subsequent to december  contractual obligations in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating lease commitments not included in the table above are normal recurring accounts payable or accrued expenses which are presented on the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
on december   the board of directors adopted a resolution authorizing the company to provide lease automobiles to field service and sales personnel commencing in the estimated cost for the leased vehicles over a month period is expected to be approximately  plus operating costs 
off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity is cash from operations  which depends heavily on sales of our ivd instruments  consumables and service  as well as sales of sample processing instruments and supplies 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents amounted to million 
operating cash flows 
cash flow provided by operations for the year ended december  increased significantly to million compared to million in the prior year 
our results of operations include million in non cash items as follows million in process research and development expenditures  million in deferred taxes  million from depreciation and amortization and million stock based compensation expense 
in addition cash flow was strengthened by million of increased accounts payable  accrued expenses and lower inventory levels 
the improvement was partially offset by the investment of an additional million in financing sales type leases for customers 
the relationship of receivables to revenues has decreased over the prior year 
the number of days sales in accounts receivable decreased to at the end of compared to days at the end of the number of days sales in inventory decreased to days at the end of compared to days at the end of the lower number of days sales in inventory is due to  higher sales volume and improved inventory planning procedures and reduced amount of lead time required for safety stock on hand 
in addition the level of inventory on hand for the legacy product line continued to decrease during our cash flow continues to be favorably affected by the fact that we have net operating loss carry forwards of million for federal and million for state 
we also have tax credit carry forwards of million for federal and million for state  net of valuation allowances 
we continue to realize tax deductions from both the exercise of stock options and the purchase by employees of our common stock at a discount to market 
during the year ended december   we realized tax deductions of approximately million relating to these items

new accounting pronouncements in march  the fasb issued eitf  how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation that clarifies how a company discloses its recording of taxes collected that are imposed on revenue producing activities 
eitf is effective for the first interim reporting period beginning after december  the company currently reports revenue on a net basis 
the company does not expect application of eitf no 
to have any effect on the company s consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  fin an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin requires that a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not ie a likelihood of more than fifty percent that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
a recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
upon adoption  the cumulative effect of applying the recognition and measurement provisions of fin  if any  shall be reflected as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of fin on our financial statements
