item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview our goal is to acquire or originate arm assets for our portfolio using both equity capital and borrowed funds and finance them in such a way so as to achieve earnings and dividend stability as our primary objective  and earnings and dividend growth as our secondary objective 
in order to achieve these objectives  we must mitigate key risks inherent in the mortgage portfolio lending business  principally credit risk and interest rate risk  while simultaneously pursuing earnings growth strategies 
our three primary strategies are i to increase our more profitable  higher margin mortgage loan origination business  ii to raise common stock and access alternative sources of long term capital such as preferred stock and unsecured debt that provide increased earnings to our existing common stock and iii to grow our assets relative to our existing capital base by pursuing non recourse funding sources  relying less on reverse repurchase agreements and more on collateralized mortgage debt to finance our balance sheet 
earnings growth strategies higher margin loan originations 
our goal remains to increase our loan originations as a percentage of our annual portfolio acquisitions due to the higher margin potential of those assets 
despite continued highly competitive pricing  industry wide origination decreases and a more aggressive approach to granting credit by other mortgage lenders  our loan originations totaled billion and billion in the three and twelve months ended december   respectively  exceeding total production by and our annual target by 
we expect our mortgage origination volumes will remain strong going forward based on the million of loans in the fallout adjusted pipeline at december   most of which we expect will close in the first quarter of our correspondent relationships have increased year over year  and we now have approximately correspondent partners across the country 
in the second quarter of  we began originating loans through mortgage brokerage firms  our wholesale channel 
we remain confident that as this channel grows  it will become an attractive source of higher yielding loans for us 
we also believe our entry into the wholesale business on a fully paperless and internet based basis will offer improved levels of service within the industry 
leveraging the same strategy that has proven successful with correspondent lenders  including superior service  sensible underwriting and products designed to meet our sophisticated clients needs  we anticipate generating similar success over time 
as of december   we had mortgage brokerage firms approved to do business with us 
we have also expanded our customer retention and referral program the thornburg mortgage exchange program sm as the earnings benefit of retaining an existing client is greater than on new origination business 
our core service feature under this program has been the loan modification option  in which our borrowers can change the rate or other terms of their loans with a brief phone call and a small fee 
since  we have modified  loans representing billion 
another feature of the thornburg mortgage exchange program sm is that  on a streamlined basis  our borrowers can cash out equity from their homes 
our growing loan servicing portfolio  or client base  which grew over the year ago period to billion  should be a promising source for loan exchanges and new loans in the future 
this servicing portfolio now represents  customers 
adfitech acquisition 
on august   we acquired adfitech  a provider of quality control post closing audit and document delivery services to the mortgage industry  from a subsidiary of centex corporation 
prior to the acquisition  we partnered with adfitech for three years on an outsourced basis for quality control services  imaging and other selected mortgage related functions that supported our loan origination business across all loan origination channels correspondent  wholesale and direct retail 
in the near term  the acquisition expands our operational platform and gives us increased control over many of the back office operations needed to grow our loan origination business 
over the longer term  adfitech will provide us with an entry point into providing pre and post funding quality control services to the mortgage industry giving us the opportunity to develop a new source of non interest income 
adfitech will continue to operate as a separate business unit as a wholly owned subsidiary of tmhl and will continue to serve its mortgage lending clients on a business as usual basis from its headquarters in edmond  oklahoma 
the results of adfitech s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since it was acquired and are not material 

table of contents 
index to financial statements long term capital growth 
we raised million of new common equity capital during at an average net price of per share and million of new preferred equity capital at an average net price of per share 
this new long term capital will contribute modestly to additional balance sheet and earnings growth in the future  principally through the acquisition and origination of high quality arm assets 
going forward  given the tight spread environment on arm assets  rate of return opportunities are lower than they have been in previous years  and we may consider utilizing alternative lower cost  long term capital sources such as preferred stock and unsecured debt to support future earnings and balance sheet growth 
capital efficient collateralized mortgage debt transactions 
since collateralized mortgage debt represents long term debt financing and the debt has no margin call risk  it reduces our capital requirements when used to finance our portfolio  providing an additional source of balance sheet and earnings growth 
our financing capital requirement for collateralized mortgage debt is lowered to the capital required to support the financing which  in the aggregate  approximates versus our customary minimum capital requirement for reverse repurchase agreement and asset backed cp financing 
this more efficient use of capital allows us to invest in additional high quality arm assets financed through recourse borrowings 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed a billion collateralized mortgage debt transaction which freed up an estimated million of capital  which will allow us to acquire an additional million in arm assets during use of excess capital to grow interest earning assets 
since the second quarter of  we began utilizing a portion of our excess capital to increase our holdings of interest earning assets 
by reducing our adjusted equity to assets ratio from an average of during the second quarter of to at december   we were able to boost core earnings without compromising our strong liquidity position  as evidenced by our continued strong unencumbered asset position and growing value of hedging instruments  which totaled billion at december  see the adjusted equity to assets calculation on page consistent profitability our business model is designed to protect our profitability during periods of changing interest rates or yield curves in that we fund our hybrid arm portfolio with fixed rate borrowings and hybrid hedging instruments of comparable duration 
because longer duration funds are usually more expensive  this strategy reduced our net interest income and earnings potential in prior years  but has been a contributor to our relative earnings stability through this current rising interest rate cycle and flattening yield curve environment 
nevertheless  our earnings during the fourth quarter of reflect the continued difficult competitive and operating environment  which has continued to put downward pressure on our portfolio margin resulting in earnings that were below the level required to maintain the current dividend on our common stock 
we have seen tighter spreads on arm assets caused by reduced mortgage loan volume in general and intense competition for the volume that remains 
further  our older swap agreements have begun to mature whereas our older hybrid arms are not resetting or prepaying as quickly as we had anticipated because of the current higher interest rate environment 
while the federal funds rate did not change during the quarter  the yield curve remained inverted with short term and long term rates holding flat  which may also impact future arm origination volume 
our approach to offsetting these competitive market and balance sheet pressures remains the same to grow our balance sheet using an array of asset acquisition  financing and capital strategies including employing our strong capital base while still managing interest rate and credit risk 
additionally  approximately billion of our hybrid arms have interest rates that will reset over the next months from an average interest rate of to a current market rate 
after the payment of the fourth quarter dividend  we had in reserve an estimated per share of common stock of undistributed taxable income 
prepayment activity in the fourth quarter was cpr  down from during the same quarter a year ago 
for the year  prepayments averaged cpr  as compared to cpr for the year as prepayment activity continued to slow over the last year  we made two adjustments to our expected future prepayment rates on our arm assets in accordance with sfas  accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases to more closely conform future prepayment expectations to the slower actual prepayments the portfolio experienced over the annual impact of the adjustments to future prepayment vectors made in was million 
additionally  the premium amortization was and will in the future be influenced by other factors including new asset acquisitions  changes in the forward interest rate curve  actual prepayments relative to prior period estimates of future prepayment expectations and changes in the indices that drive future yields on hybrid arm and traditional arm assets 
in  these other factors combined to further reduce premium amortization by million from the million experienced for the year we evaluate all of the above factors on a monthly basis to calculate premium amortization such that the actual historical and expected future arm asset cash flows plus amortization generate a level yield over the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements period from purchase date until maturity 
given that the short term interest rates that determine the yields on arm assets continued to rise through and the yield curve inverted  we realized a benefit in our premium amortization calculation related to an expected increase in the expected lifetime yields on our arm assets due to the increase in the index rate used to adjust the rates on arm assets 
additionally  the slower actual and estimated future prepayment rates implied that a greater percentage of our hybrid arm assets were expected to survive their fixed rate period and not prepay prior to the end of their fixed rate periods 
having a larger balance after the interest rate reset results in a higher yield on these hybrid and traditional arm assets over their entire lives 
going forward  we will continue to regularly review our long term prepayment assumptions relative to actual experience and future expectations which may  particularly if recent historical metrics continue  result in additional downward adjustments in our prepayment assumptions given our current long term assumptions 
actual prepayments below expected prepayments can also be expected to reduce our quarterly premium amortization from our current expectations  assuming no change in the arm indices from the current level 
we possess a number of strategic advantages that allow us to generate consistent profitability over time 
one of these strategic advantages is our low operating expense structure 
during  our operating expenses as a percent of average assets were  compared to during we are able to operate at this low level of operating expenses relative to the size of our portfolio because we do not operate like a traditional mortgage lender or fdic insured depository institution 
we acquire many of our assets through mbs purchases  originate loans by developing strategic partnerships with correspondent lenders  mortgage brokerage firms  lending partners and other sources  and fund our balance sheet using capital market sourced funds  as opposed to fdic insured deposits and fhlb advances 
as a result  we generally avoid the high overhead associated with retail branch networks and commissioned loan officers 
in addition  we have developed other outsourced strategic partnerships that provide loan fulfillment services on a variable cost basis 
a significant component of our cost structure is a performance fee paid to the manager based on roe which has declined over the past year  resulting in a comparable decline in operating expense as a percentage of assets 
this low  variable cost model has allowed us to operate profitably with a lower interest rate spread on our portfolio  enabling us to mitigate certain cyclical risks frequently associated with mortgage banking and portfolio lending activities 
our low operating cost structure and reit tax status have allowed us to reduce investment risk and invest primarily in high quality arm assets 
we elect to securitize our acquired and originated arm loans or invest primarily in aaa or aa rated securities  agency securities or a quality arm loans 
this strategy has resulted in very low credit losses 
see additional discussion in the exceptional credit quality and securitization section below 
finally  by employing a portfolio lending strategy and retaining all of our arm loans rather than employing a mortgage banking strategy and selling our arm loan production  we do not depend on gain on sale income  which can fluctuate significantly with loan origination volume and market conditions 
exceptional credit quality and securitization one of our strategic focuses is high credit quality assets 
we believe this strategy keeps our credit losses and financing costs low 
it also creates significant portfolio liquidity and low portfolio price volatility  which gives us access to financing through the credit cycle and contributes to maintaining consistent profitability 
as of december   of our arm asset portfolio was high quality 
many of our high quality arm assets consist of a quality arm loans that we have purchased or originated and securitized either into arm pass through certificates or into collateralized mortgage debt financings for our own portfolio 
we retain the risk of potential credit losses on all of these loans and had loan loss allowances totaling million  or bp  at december  we did not experience any credit losses on our arm loans during additionally  our high quality arm assets include purchased securitized loans  which are a quality arm loans originated and securitized by third parties which we have acquired for our portfolio 
these assets are qualifying interests for purposes of maintaining our exemption from the investment company act because we retain a ownership interest in the underlying loans 
because we purchase all classes of these securitizations  we have the credit exposure on the underlying loans 
prior to the purchase of these securities  our due diligence process allows us to remove loans that do not meet our credit standards based on loan to value ratios  borrower s credit scores  income and asset documentation and other criteria that we believe to be important indications of credit risk 
the purchase price of the classes that are less than investment grade generally includes a discount for probable credit losses  and based on management s judgment  the portion of the purchase discount which reflects the estimated unrealized loss on the securities due to credit risk is treated as a non accretable discount and totaled million  or bp  at december  
table of contents 
index to financial statements interest rate risk management interest rate changes affect our short term borrowing costs  which as a spread lender can pose a risk to our profitability if not responsibly managed 
to counter this potential risk  when we purchase or originate hybrid arm assets  we adhere to a matched funding or duration matching strategy which means we use hybrid arm hedging instruments to fix  or cap  the interest rates on the short term borrowings and collateralized mortgage debt that finance our hybrid arm assets 
we hedge our financing cost such that we maintain a net effective duration of less than one year 
the lower the effective duration gap  the less impact interest rate changes should have on the market value of our portfolio and therefore on earnings 
as of december   we had billion of hybrid arm assets and had entered into swap agreements with notional balances totaling billion and delayed swap agreements with notional balances totaling billion that become effective between february and june these delayed swap agreements have been entered into to hedge the financing of existing arm assets and the forecasted financing of arm assets purchase commitments at december   and to replace swap agreements as they mature 
additionally  at december   we had cap agreements with aggregate net notional balances of million 
these cap agreements receive payments if one month libor rises above a range of to  and on average 
during the quarter ended december   we received payments of million related to these cap agreements 
as of december   we measured the net effective duration applicable to our hybrid arm portfolio  related borrowings and hybrid arm hedging instruments at approximately zero years  while the financing and hedging of all of our arm assets resulted in a net effective duration of approximately years 
we continue to employ a duration matching funding strategy as we acquire hybrid arm assets in order to stabilize earnings during periods of rising interest rates 
as we acquire arm assets  we attempt to lock in a spread that is expected to provide a rate of return at or above our threshold requirement 
in order to stabilize the spread over the expected life of our arm assets  we use hedging instruments in conjunction with our borrowings to approximate the repricing characteristics of our arm assets 
given the prepayment uncertainties on our arm assets  there is no guaranteed way to lock in a spread between the yield on our arm assets and the related borrowing that would produce an acceptable rate of return 
however  through active management  we believe we can continue to mitigate a significant amount of net interest income volatility 
see the discussion of effects of interest rate changes on page funding diversification another long term objective is to achieve a more balanced funding mix between asset backed cp  collateralized mortgage debt and reverse repurchase agreements in order to reduce our reliance on any one funding source 
historically  we have relied principally on reverse repurchase agreements for our funding needs 
since year end  we have been actively working towards diversifying our financing sources 
at that time  of our borrowings were provided through reverse repurchase agreements 
at december   reverse repurchase agreements accounted for only of our borrowings  while collateralized mortgage debt represented and our asset backed cp facility accounted for 
we anticipate that collateralized mortgage debt and asset backed cp will continue to grow as a percentage of our financing sources in the future 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap  which requires the use of estimates and assumptions 
in accordance with sec guidance  those material accounting policies and estimates that we believe are the most critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition and require complex management judgment are discussed below 
revenue recognition 
interest income on arm assets is a combination of the interest earned based on the outstanding balance and contractual terms of the assets and the amortization of yield adjustments  principally the amortization of purchase premiums and discounts 
premiums and discounts associated with the purchase of arm assets are amortized into interest income over the estimated lives of the assets in accordance with sfas  accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases  using the interest method adjusted for the effects of actual and future estimated prepayments and the current index on arm assets 
the use of these methods requires us to project cash flows over the remaining life of each asset based on these factors 
these projections include assumptions about interest rates  prepayment rates  timing and amount of credit losses  estimates regarding the likelihood and timing of calls of securities at par  and other factors 
estimating prepayments and estimating the remaining lives of our arm assets requires management judgment  which involves consideration of possible future interest rate environments and an estimate of how borrowers will behave in those environments 
we review our cash flow projections on an ongoing basis and monitor these projections based on input and analyses received from external 
table of contents 
index to financial statements sources  internal models  and our own judgment and experience 
we regularly review our assumptions and make adjustments to the cash flows as deemed necessary 
there is no assurance that the assumptions we use to estimate future cash flows  or the current period s yield for each asset  will prove to be accurate 
the following table presents a sensitivity analysis to show the one time adjustment we would have to make to our net purchase premium of million at december  for and cpr increases and decreases to our lifetime prepayment assumptions 
the purpose of this analysis is to provide an indication of the impact that changes to the lifetime prepayment assumptions have on our purchase premium 
we believe the current lifetime assumptions used are appropriate and consistent with our long term portfolio experience 
changed assumption increase decrease in net purchase premium in thousands prepayment assumption increased by cpr prepayment assumption increased by cpr prepayment assumption decreased by cpr prepayment assumption decreased by cpr future premium amortization will also be influenced by new asset acquisitions  changes in the forward interest rate curve and changes in the indices that drive future yields on hybrid arm and traditional arm assets 
fair value 
we record our purchased arm assets  commitments to purchase arm loans and hybrid arm hedging instruments at fair value 
the fair values of our purchased arm assets and hybrid arm hedging instruments are generally based on market prices provided by third party pricing services or certain dealers which make markets in these financial instruments 
if the fair value of a purchased arm asset  hybrid arm hedging instrument or other financial instrument is not reasonably available from a third party pricing service or dealer  management estimates the fair value 
this requires management judgment in determining how the market would value a particular purchased arm asset  hybrid arm hedging instrument or other financial instrument  based on characteristics of the security and available market information 
the net unrealized gain or loss on loans expected to be purchased from correspondent lenders and bulk sellers is calculated using the same methodologies that are used to price our arm loans  adjusted for anticipated fallout of purchase loan commitments that will likely not be funded 
the fair values reported reflect estimates and may not necessarily be indicative of the amounts we could realize in a current market exchange 
at december   management s judgment was used to estimate the fair value on of our purchased arm assets and of our commitments to purchase arm loans 
impairment of purchased arm assets and non accretable discounts on purchased arm assets 
purchased arm assets are evaluated for impairment on a quarterly basis  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that these investments may be impaired 
we evaluate whether our purchased arm assets are considered impaired  evaluate whether the impairment is other than temporary  and  if the impairment is other than temporary  recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the purchased arm asset s amortized cost basis and its fair value 
these evaluations require management to make estimates and judgments based on changes in market interest rates  changes in credit ratings  delinquency data on the loans underlying the respective securities and other information to determine whether unrealized losses are reflective of credit deterioration and to evaluate management s ability and intent to hold the investment to maturity or recovery 
because the estimate for other than temporary impairment requires management judgment  we consider this to be a critical accounting estimate 
we have determined that the gross unrealized losses of million on purchased arm assets at december  are not reflective of credit deterioration and because we have the ability and intent to hold the purchased arm assets until recovery  the losses are not other than temporary impairments 
a portion of our purchased securitized loans are rated less than investment grade and represent subordinated interests in high quality  first lien residential mortgage loans where we own all of the securitized classes 
we generally purchase the less than investment grade classes at a discount 
based upon management s use of analysis and judgment  a portion of the purchase discount is subsequently accreted as interest income under the effective yield method while the remaining portion of the purchase discount is treated as a non accretable discount which reflects the estimated unrealized loss on the securities due to credit losses on the underlying loans 
we review purchased securitized loans periodically for impairment and record or adjust non accretable discounts accordingly 
non accretable discounts are increased by recognizing an impairment loss when management determines that there is a decline in the fair value of 
table of contents 
index to financial statements purchased securitized loan that is considered other than temporary and decreased when there is improvement in the risk exposures 
any such determinations are based on management s assessment of numerous factors affecting the fair value of purchased securitized loans  including  but not limited to  current economic conditions  potential for natural disasters  delinquency trends  credit losses to date on underlying mortgages and remaining credit protection 
if management ultimately concludes that the non accretable discounts will not represent realized losses  the balances are accreted into earnings over the remaining life of the loan under the interest method 
allowance for loan losses on arm loans 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses based on management s estimate of credit losses inherent in our portfolio of arm loans 
the estimation of the reserve is based on a variety of factors including  but not limited to  industry statistics  current economic conditions  potential for natural disasters  loan portfolio composition  delinquency trends  credit losses to date on underlying loans and remaining credit protection 
if the credit performance of our arm loans is different than expected  we adjust the allowance for loan losses to a level deemed appropriate by management to provide for estimated losses inherent in our arm loan portfolio 
two critical assumptions used in estimating the allowance for loan losses are an assumed rate of default  which is the expected rate at which loans go into foreclosure over the life of the loans  and an assumed rate of loss severity  which represents the expected rate of realized loss upon disposition of the properties that have gone into foreclosure 
the following table presents a sensitivity analysis to show the impact on our allowance for loan losses at december  of using increases and decreases in the borrower s propensity to default and the loss severity if there is a default 
the purpose of this analysis is to provide an indication of the impact that defaults and loss severity assumptions have on our estimate of allowance for loan losses 
it is not intended to imply our expectation of future default levels or changes in loss severity 
we believe the current assumptions used for defaults and loss severity are appropriate 
changed assumption increase decrease in allowance for loan losses in thousands default assumption increased by default assumption decreased by loss severity assumption increased by loss severity assumption decreased by for additional information on our significant accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements

index to financial statements in march  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for servicing of financial assets

under sfas  servicing assets and liabilities are no longer recognized in securitizations that are not accounted for as sales under sfas it also requires all separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities to be initially measured at fair value  and permits companies to elect  on a class by class basis  to account for servicing assets and liabilities on either a lower of cost or market value basis or a fair value measurement basis 
we adopted sfas on january  and have not recognized any servicing assets or liabilities in connection with our securitizations subsequent to that date because they are accounted for as secured borrowings under sfas we did not elect to measure our previously existing servicing assets at fair value and continue to measure them at the lower of cost or market value

index to financial statements interest rate risk management the hybrid arm portfolio comprised of the total arm portfolio  or billion  at december   compared to  or billion as of december  we attempt to mitigate our interest rate risk by funding our arm portfolio with borrowings and hedging instruments with an effective duration approximately matching the effective duration on our arm assets 
some of our borrowings bear variable or short term one year or less fixed interest rates because our traditional arm assets have interest rates that adjust within one year 
however  most of our hybrid arm assets are financed with short term borrowings that are hedged with hybrid arm hedging instruments that fix the interest rate on those borrowings such that the net effective duration is less than one year 
by maintaining a net effective duration of less than one year  which is our maximum effective duration policy limit  the combined price change of our hybrid arm assets  associated hybrid arm hedging instruments and other borrowings is expected to be a maximum of for a parallel shift in interest rates 
a lower effective duration indicates a lower expected volatility of earnings given future changes in interest rates

we recorded a net gain of million on derivatives during the year ended december  this gain consisted of a net gain of million on pipeline hedging instruments and a net gain of million on commitments to purchase loans from correspondent lenders and bulk sellers partially offset by a million loss on other derivative transactions 
the net gain on derivatives is driven by several factors including the size of the loan pipeline  the expected and actual fallout rates  changes in interest rates  changes in the shape of the yield curve  changes in mortgage spreads  and our pipeline hedging long or short bias 
these factors work together or in opposition to increase or decrease respectively the net gain or loss on derivatives in a particular reporting period

securitization activity during  we securitized billion of our arm loans into seven collateralized mortgage debt securitizations 
while tmhl transferred all of the arm loans to a separate bankruptcy remote legal entity  on a consolidated basis we did not account for these securitizations as sales and  therefore  did not record any gain or loss in connection with the securitizations

conversely  if prepayment expectations decrease  we would amortize the premium over a longer time period  resulting in a higher yield to maturity 
we monitor our prepayment experience and future expectations on a periodic basis and adjust the amortization of the net premium  as appropriate 
liquidity and capital resources we manage liquidity to ensure that we have the continuing ability to maintain cash flows that are adequate to fund operations and meet commitments on a timely and cost effective basis 
at december   we had unencumbered assets of billion  consisting of unpledged arm assets  cash and cash equivalents  and other assets 
we had unencumbered assets of billion at december  we believe that our liquidity level is in excess of that necessary to satisfy our operating requirements and we expect to continue to use diverse funding sources to maintain our financial flexibility 

table of contents 
index to financial statements sources of funds our primary sources of funds for the year ended december  consisted of reverse repurchase agreements  asset backed cp  collateralized mortgage debt  whole loan financing facilities and subordinated notes  as well as new equity proceeds and principal and interest payments from arm assets 
the reverse repurchase agreement market is approximately a trillion market  the asset backed cp market is approximately an billion market and the aaa rated mortgage and asset backed securities market is approximately a trillion market  all of which have been readily available sources of financing for mortgage assets  particularly those rated aa or better 
using collateralized mortgage debt as financing effectively eliminates rollover and margin call risk for the related portion of our balance sheet 
to supplement our funding sources  we also issue equity securities and unsecured long term debt 
we have arrangements to enter into reverse repurchase agreements with different financial institutions and as of december   had borrowed funds from of these firms 
at december   we had billion of reverse repurchase agreements outstanding with a weighted average effective borrowing rate of and a weighted average remaining term to maturity of months 
we also have a billion asset backed cp facility  which provides an alternative way to finance a portion of our arm portfolio 
we issue asset backed cp to investors in the form of secured liquidity notes that are recorded as borrowings on our consolidated balance sheets and are rated p by moody s investors service  f by fitch ratings and a by standard and poor s 
as of december   we had billion of asset backed cp outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of and a weighted average remaining maturity of days 
because we borrow money under reverse repurchase and asset backed cp agreements based on the fair value of our arm assets  and because changes in interest rates can negatively impact the valuation of arm assets  our borrowing ability under these agreements may be limited and lenders may initiate margin calls in the event interest rates change or the value of our arm assets declines for other reasons 
external disruptions to credit markets might also impair access to additional liquidity and  therefore  we might be required to sell certain mortgage assets in order to maintain liquidity 
if required  such sales might be at prices lower than the carrying value of the assets  which would result in losses 
our hedging instruments help offset this risk and since inception of our operations  we have never had to sell assets to maintain liquidity 
all of our collateralized mortgage debt is secured by arm loans 
for financial reporting purposes  the arm loans collateralizing debt are recorded as our assets and the collateralized mortgage debt is recorded as our debt 
in some transactions  hedging instruments are held by the trusts and are recorded as our assets or liabilities 
the hedging instruments either fix the interest rates of the pass through certificates or cap the interest rate exposure on these transactions

capital utilization and leverage the board of directors has approved a policy that limits our capacity to borrow funds to finance arm assets based on our long term capital 
we monitor the relationship between our arm assets  borrowings and long term capital using a variety of different measures 
however  the primary operating policy that limits our borrowings and leverage is a requirement to maintain our adjusted equity to assets ratio  a non gaap measurement  at a minimum of 
broadly speaking  this ratio reflects the relationship between those arm assets financed with borrowings that are subject to margin calls and our long term capital position 
see the table below for the calculation of this ratio 
recourse or marginable debt generally consists of reverse repurchase agreements  asset backed cp and whole loan financing facilities 
these borrowings are based on the current market value of our arm assets  are short term in nature  mature on a frequent basis weighted average maturity of months as of december   need to be rolled over at each maturity date and are subject to margin calls based on collateral value changes or changes in margin requirements 
for these reasons  our policy requires that we maintain significant excess capital and liquidity above the initial margin requirement to meet future margin calls as a result of unexpected changes in margin requirements and collateral value 
our initial margin requirements typically average between and for these borrowings  so our policy requires that we maintain an adjusted equity to assets ratio of at least against the financing of these arm assets 
the minimum policy requirement provides a capital cushion that we feel confident will be sufficient to allow us to fund future margin requirements that might result from changes in the value of our assets or hedging instruments or changes in margin requirements 
historically  this capital cushion has proved to be more than adequate to support our borrowing arrangements through a variety of interest rate and credit cycles 
we use the adjusted equity to assets ratio as a way to ensure that we always have an adequate capital cushion relative to those recourse borrowings subject to margin call 
if we did not maintain a sufficient capital cushion to meet initial and ongoing margin requirements  we could be forced to liquidate arm assets  potentially at a loss  at a time when our arm assets had declined in value or when margin requirements had changed 
the potential limitation that may result from the use of the non gaap measurement is that  in an economic environment where the market value of the investment portfolio is increasing  the amount of capital that we can invest will be less than the amount then available for investment under a comparable gaap measurement 
although we acknowledge this limitation  we believe that it is not prudent to factor these market gains into the calculation of leveragable capital because the gains may be short term in nature 
the potential volatility in market prices could result in subsequent reversal of the gains that would require subsequent disposition of arm assets in unfavorable market conditions 
as we increase our use of collateralized mortgage debt  the risk of margin calls  changes in margin requirements and potential refinancing risk is reduced because collateralized mortgage debt represents long term non recourse financing whose terms are established at the time of the financing and are not subject to change 
as a result  the need to maintain a capital cushion comparable to what we maintain on our recourse borrowings is eliminated 
for purposes of maintaining an adequate capital cushion  our policy allows us to eliminate all assets and the associated long term equity capital associated with collateralized mortgage debt from our operating capital ratio 
because collateralized mortgage debt only requires approximately of equity capital to support the transactions  versus our customary minimum capital requirement on our recourse borrowings  we are able to use this freed up capital to acquire additional arm assets 
we expect that we will be able to retain and carry an increased amount of assets in the future as a percentage of our equity capital base 
additionally  
table of contents 
index to financial statements we eliminate from our adjusted equity to assets ratio any unrealized market value adjustments  recorded as oci  from our equity accounts and we include our senior notes and subordinated notes as forms of long term capital as if the notes were equity capital 
the following table presents the calculation of our adjusted equity to assets ratio  a non gaap measurement dollar amounts in thousands december  december  assets adjustments net unrealized loss on purchased arm assets net unrealized gain on hedging instruments arm loans collateralizing debt cap agreements adjusted assets shareholders equity adjustments accumulated other comprehensive loss equity supporting collateralized mortgage debt collateralized mortgage debt arm loans collateralizing debt cap agreements senior notes subordinated notes adjusted shareholders equity adjusted equity to assets ratio gaap equity to assets ratio ratio of historical equity to historical assets ratio of long term equity to historical assets total risk based capital risk weighted assets the above table also presents four alternative capital utilization measurements to our adjusted equity to assets ratio 
the first alternative capital utilization measurement is the gaap equity to assets ratio  a calculation that simply divides total gaap equity by total assets 
while the simplest of all equity to assets calculations  it is not used by management to manage our balance sheet because it includes factors such as unrealized gains and losses on assets and hedging instruments deemed to be less important to the long term operating nature of our business since our assets are not held for sale and since the unrealized gains and losses are not permanent impairments of our equity or of these assets and hedging instruments 
if we did use the gaap measurement as a basis for our leverage limitation and if our board of directors approved policy limited our gaap equity to assets to a minimum of  our total assets would have been reduced to billion instead of the billion of assets owned as of december  in part  we are able to carry those additional assets by financing a portion of our arm assets with collateralized mortgage debt financings  which have an initial fixed capital requirement of approximately of the assets financed in this way 
the gaap measurement ignores changes in the level of equity required to support various forms of financing as the mix of our financing of arm assets changes between financing subject to margin requirements and collateralized mortgage debt financings which are not subject to margin requirements 
this is another reason why we do not use the gaap measurement to make leverage or capital utilization decisions 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the second alternative capital utilization measurement is the ratio of historical equity to historical assets 
this is a non gaap measurement that eliminates the market value adjustment of our assets and hedging instruments included in oci 
this measurement is calculated by dividing the sum of the assets  net unrealized gain loss on purchased arm assets and net unrealized gain loss on hedging instruments in the table above by the sum of shareholders equity and oci 
our historical equity to assets ratio is higher than the regulatory well capitalized threshold of required of banks and savings and loan institutions for the tier i core capital ratio 
the third alternative capital utilization measurement is the ratio of long term equity to historical assets 
this is a non gaap measurement that eliminates the market value adjustment of our assets and hedging instruments included in oci 
this calculation also includes senior notes and subordinated notes as a component of our long term capital base 
this measurement is calculated by dividing the sum of the assets  net unrealized gain loss on purchased arm assets and net unrealized gain loss on hedging instruments in the table above by long term capital 
we monitor these ratios in order to have a complete picture of the relationship between our total assets and long term equity position 
the fourth alternative capital utilization measurement is a calculation of our total risk based capital ratio  a regulatory calculation required to be made by banks and savings and loan institutions that comply with federal reserve board capital requirements 
the ratio results from dividing the sum of our historical and supplementary capital by total risk weighted assets as presented in the thrift financial report instructions 
risk based capital measures capital requirements for assets based on their credit exposure as defined by the regulation  with lower credit risk assets requiring less capital and higher credit risk assets requiring more capital 
although we are not subject to these regulatory requirements  we focus our efforts on only high quality assets 
therefore  our risk based capital ratio tends to be quite high when compared to banking institutions  and well in excess of the regulatory minimum of required for banks and savings and loan institutions to qualify as well capitalized

market risks the market risk management discussion and the amounts estimated from the analysis that follows are forward looking statements that assume that certain market conditions will occur 
actual results may differ materially from these projected results due to changes in our arm portfolio and borrowings mix and due to developments in the domestic and global financial and real estate markets 
developments in the financial markets include the likelihood of changes in interest rates and in the relationship of various interest rates and their impact on our arm portfolio yield  cost of funds and cash flows 
as a financial institution that has only us dollar denominated assets  liabilities and hedging instruments  we are not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
our market risk exposure is largely due to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is defined as the sensitivity of our current and future earnings to interest rate volatility  variability of spread relationships  the difference in repricing intervals between our assets and liabilities and the effect that interest rates may have on our cash flows  especially arm portfolio prepayments 
interest rate risk impacts our interest income  interest expense and the market value on a large portion of our assets and liabilities 
the management of interest rate risk attempts to maximize earnings and to preserve capital by minimizing the negative impacts of changing interest rates  asset and liability mix  and prepayment activity 
the table below presents an approximation of the sensitivity of the market value of our arm portfolio  including purchase commitments  using a discounted cash flow simulation model 
application of this method results in an estimation of the percentage change in the market value of our assets  liabilities and hedging instruments per and bp shifts in interest rates expressed in years a measure commonly referred to as effective duration 
positive portfolio effective duration indicates that the market value of the total portfolio will decline if interest rates rise and increase if interest rates decline 
negative portfolio effective duration indicates that the market value of the total portfolio will decline if interest rates decline and increase if interest rates rise 
the closer effective duration is to zero  the less interest rate changes are expected to affect earnings 
included in the table is a base case effective duration calculation for an interest rate scenario that assumes future rates are those implied by the yield curve as of december  the other four scenarios assume interest rates are instantaneously and bps lower and and bps higher than those implied by interest rates as of december  the use of hybrid arm hedging instruments is a critical part of our interest rate risk management strategies  and the effects of these hybrid arm hedging instruments on the market value of the portfolio are reflected in the model s output 
this analysis also takes into consideration the value of options embedded in our arm assets including constraints on the repricing of the interest rates of arm assets resulting from periodic and lifetime cap features  as well as prepayment options 
assets and liabilities that are not interest rate sensitive  such as cash  payment receivables  prepaid expenses  payables and accrued expenses  are excluded 
the effective duration calculated from this model is a key measure of the effectiveness of our interest rate risk management strategies

changes in assumptions including  but not limited to  volatility  mortgage and financing spreads  prepayment behavior and defaults  changes in the shape of the yield curve  as well as the timing and level of interest rate changes  will affect the results of the model 
therefore  actual results are likely to vary from modeled results 
although market value sensitivity analysis is widely accepted in identifying interest rate risk  it does not take into consideration changes that may occur such as  but not limited to  changes in investment and financing strategies  changes in market spreads  and changes in business volumes 
accordingly  we make extensive use of an earnings simulation model to further analyze our level of interest rate risk 
there are a number of key assumptions in our earnings simulation model 
these key assumptions include changes in market conditions that affect interest rates  the shape of the yield curve  the pricing of arm products  the availability of arm products  and the availability and the cost of financing for arm products 
other key assumptions made in using the simulation model include prepayment speeds and management s investment  financing and hedging strategies  and the issuance of new equity 
we typically run the simulation model under a variety of hypothetical business scenarios that may include different interest rate scenarios  different investment strategies  different prepayment possibilities and other scenarios that provide us with a range of possible earnings outcomes in order to assess potential interest rate risk 
the assumptions used represent our estimate of the likely effect of changes in interest rates and do not necessarily reflect actual results 
the earnings simulation model takes into account periodic and lifetime caps embedded in our arm assets in determining the earnings at risk 
at december   our earnings model base case implies a normalized upward sloping yield curve rather than the current inverted yield curve 
based on the earnings simulation model  our potential earnings increase decrease from our base case earnings forecast for a parallel and bp decline and and bp rise in market interest rates over the next twelve months and an adjustment in prepayment speeds as interest rates change  was   and  respectively  of projected net income for the year ending december  the assumptions used in the earnings simulation model are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the analysis cannot precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net income 
actual results could differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes  changes in prepayment speed other than what was assumed in the model  and changes in other market conditions and management strategies to offset our potential exposure  among other factors 
this measure of risk represents our exposure to higher or lower interest rates at a particular point in time 
our actual risk is always changing 
we continuously monitor our risk profile and alter our strategies as appropriate based on our view of interest rates and other developments in our business

index to financial statements effects of interest rate changes changes in interest rates impact our earnings in various ways 
while we invest primarily in arm assets  rising short term interest rates may temporarily negatively affect our earnings  and  conversely  falling short term interest rates may temporarily increase our earnings 
this impact can occur for several reasons and may be mitigated by portfolio prepayment activity and portfolio funding and hedging strategies 
for example  our borrowings may react to changes in interest rates sooner than our arm assets because the weighted average next repricing date of our borrowings may be sooner than that of our arm assets 
additionally  interest rates on traditional arm assets may be limited to an increase of either or per adjustment period commonly referred to as the periodic cap  or indices may be based on weighted averages rather than current rates  while our borrowings do not have similar limitations 
our arm assets also typically lag changes in the applicable interest rate indices by days  due to the notice period provided to arm borrowers when the interest rates on their loans are scheduled to change 
interest rates can also affect our net return on hybrid arm assets net of the cost of financing hybrid arm assets 
we estimate the effective duration of our hybrid arm assets and have a policy to hedge the financing of the hybrid arm assets such that the net effective duration is less than one year 
during a declining interest rate environment  the prepayment of hybrid arm assets may accelerate causing the amount of fixed rate financing to increase relative to the amount of hybrid arm assets  possibly resulting in a decline in our net return on hybrid arm assets as replacement hybrid arm assets may have lower yields than the ones paying off 
in contrast  during a rising interest rate environment  hybrid arm assets may prepay slower than expected  requiring us to finance more hybrid arm assets with more costly funds than was originally anticipated  resulting in a decline in our net return on hybrid arm assets 
in order to manage our exposure to changes in the prepayment speed of hybrid arm assets  we regularly monitor the balance of hybrid arm assets and make adjustments to the amounts anticipated to be outstanding in future periods and  on a regular basis  make adjustments to the amount of our fixed rate borrowing obligations in future periods 
interest rate changes can also affect the availability and pricing of arm assets  which affects our investment opportunities 
during a rising interest rate environment  there may be less total loan origination and refinance activity  but a larger percentage of arm products being originated  mitigating the impact of lower overall loan origination and refinance activity 
conversely  during a declining interest rate environment  consumers  in general  may favor fixed rate mortgage products  but because there will likely be above average loan origination and refinancing volume in the industry  even a small percentage of arm product volume may provide sufficient investment opportunities 
additionally  a flat or inverted yield curve may be an adverse environment for arm products because there may be little incentive for a consumer to choose an arm product over a year fixed rate mortgage loan 
conversely  in a steep yield curve environment  arm products may enjoy an above average advantage over year fixed rate mortgage loans  increasing our investment opportunities 
the volume of arm loans being originated industry wide can also affect their investment yield 
during periods when there is a shortage of arm products  yields may decline due to market forces and conversely  when there is an above average supply of arm products  yields may improve due to the same market forces 
the prepayment rate on our arm assets may increase if interest rates decline or if the difference between long term and short term interest rates diminishes 
an increase in prepayments would cause us to amortize the premiums paid for our arm assets faster  resulting in a lower yield on our arm assets 
additionally  if prepayment proceeds cannot be reinvested in arm assets having similar yields to those being replaced  our earnings may be adversely affected 
conversely  the prepayment rate on our arm assets may decrease if interest rates rise or if the difference between long term and short term interest rates increases 
decreased prepayments would cause us to amortize the premiums paid for our arm assets over a longer time period  resulting in an increased yield on our arm assets 
therefore  in rising interest rate environments where prepayments are declining  not only would the interest rate on the arm portfolio reset to reflect higher interest rates  but the yield would also rise due to slower prepayments 
the combined effect could significantly mitigate other negative effects that rising short term interest rates might have on earnings 
lastly  because we invest primarily in arm assets  and a portion of such assets are purchased with shareholders equity  our earnings  over time  will tend to increase  after an initial short term decline  following periods when short term interest rates have risen  and decrease after an initial short term increase  following periods when short term interest rates have declined 
this is because the financed portion of our arm portfolio will  over time  reprice to a spread over our cost of funds  while the portion of our arm portfolio purchased with shareholders equity will generally have a higher yield in a higher interest rate environment and a lower yield in a lower interest rate environment

index to financial statements other matters the code requires that at least of our consolidated tax assets must be qualified reit assets 
the code also requires that we meet a defined source of income test and a source of income test 
as of december   we calculated that we were in compliance with all of these requirements 
we also met all reit requirements regarding the ownership of capital stock and the distributions of our net income 
therefore  as of december   we believed that we continue to qualify as a reit under the provisions of the code 
we intend to conduct our business so as not to become regulated as an investment company under the investment company act 
if we were to become regulated as an investment company  our use of leverage would be substantially reduced 
the investment company act exempts from regulation entities that are primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate 
in order to maintain our exempt status under the investment company act  current sec staff interpretations require that at least of our assets must consist of qualifying interests  as such term has been defined by the sec staff 
in addition  unless certain mortgage securities represent all the certificates issued with respect to an underlying pool of mortgages  such mortgage securities may be treated as securities separate from the underlying mortgage loans and  thus  may not be considered qualifying interests for purposes of the requirement 
we calculated that we are in compliance with this requirement
