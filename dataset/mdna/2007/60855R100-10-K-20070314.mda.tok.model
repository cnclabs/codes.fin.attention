item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties  including those set forth under item a risk factors  above 
overview our fiscal year financial performance may be briefly summarized as follows earnings per diluted share of  premium revenue of  million  net income of million  medical care ratio of  g a expenses as a percentage of total revenue of  total membership at year end of  members includes indiana membership 
in addition  our operational achievements during the year included the start up of our ohio and texas health plans  the cape health plan acquisition in michigan  the start up of our medicare advantage special needs plans  with total enrollment at december  of approximately  members  and the strengthening of our medical management 
discussion we generate revenues primarily from the premiums we receive from the states in which we operate 
premium revenue is primarily derived from medicaid  schip  and other government sponsored programs for low income individuals 
premium revenue includes per member per month fees received for providing medical services  fee for service revenue generated by our clinics in california  fee for service reimbursement for delivery of newborns on a per case basis birth income  and in utah reimbursement of health care expenditures plus an administrative fee 
we also receive savings sharing revenue in utah and california  where we receive additional incentive payments from those states if medical costs are less than prescribed amounts 
such fee for service revenue and savings sharing revenue is included in our financial statements with our premium revenue 
starting in  our premium revenue also includes premiums generated from medicare 
premium revenue is fixed in advance of the periods covered and is not subject to significant accounting estimates 
for the year ended december   we received approximately of our premium revenue as a fixed amount per member per month  or pmpm  pursuant to our contracts with state medicaid agencies and other managed care organizations with which we operate as a subcontractor 
these premium revenues are recognized in the month members are entitled to receive health care services 
the state medicaid programs periodically adjust premium rates 
the amount of these premiums may vary widely between states and among various government programs 
pmpm premiums for schip members are generally among the company s lowest  with rates as low as approximately pmpm in california and utah 
premium revenues for medicaid members are generally higher 
among the temporary aid for needy families tanf medicaid population the medicaid group that includes most mothers and children pmpm premiums range between approximately in california to a high of approximately in ohio 
among our medicaid aged  blind and disabled 
table of contents abd membership  pmpm premiums range from approximately in california to over  in new mexico 
medicare revenue is approximately  pmpm 
approximately of our premium revenue in the year ended december  was realized under a medicaid cost plus reimbursement agreement that our utah plan has with that state 
we also received approximately of our premium revenue for the year ended december  in the form of birth income one time payments for the delivery of children from the medicaid programs in indiana  michigan  new mexico  ohio  texas and washington 
such payments are recognized as revenue in the month the birth occurs 
other revenues from savings sharing and fee for service clinic income contributed the remaining of our premium revenue 
membership growth has been the primary reason for our increasing revenues 
we have increased our membership through both internal growth and acquisitions 
the following table sets forth the approximate number of members by state in the periods presented as of december  state california indiana michigan new mexico ohio  n a texas  n a utah washington total our indiana hmo ceased serving members effective january  it currently has no members 
our ohio hmo commenced operations in december  serving less than members as of december  our texas hmo commenced operations in september the following table details member months defined as the aggregation of each month s membership for the period by state for the years ended december    and state california indiana michigan new mexico ohio texas utah washington total our indiana hmo ceased serving members effective january  it currently has no members 
our ohio hmo commenced operations in december  serving less than members as of december  our texas hmo commenced operations in september our operating expenses include expenses related to the provision of medical care services and general and administrative  or g a  costs 
our results of operations are impacted by our ability to effectively manage expenses related to health care services and to accurately predict costs incurred 

table of contents expenses related to medical care services include two components direct medical expenses and medically related administrative costs 
direct medical expenses include payments to physicians  hospitals  and providers of ancillary medical services  such as pharmacy  laboratory  and radiology services 
medically related administrative costs include expenses relating to health education  quality assurance  case management  disease management  hour on call nurses  member services  and compliance 
salary and benefit costs are a substantial portion of these expenses 
for the years ended december    and  medically related administrative costs  included in medical services in our consolidated statements of income  constituted approximately of premium revenue 
many of our primary care physicians and a small portion of our specialists and hospitals are paid on a capitation basis 
under capitation contracts  we pay a fixed per member per month payment to the provider without regard to the frequency  extent  or nature of the medical services actually furnished 
under capitated contracts we remain liable for the provision of certain health care services 
certain of our capitated contracts also contain incentive programs based on service delivery  quality of care  utilization management  and other criteria 
capitation payments are fixed in advance of periods covered and are not subject to significant accounting estimates 
these payments are expensed in the period the providers are obligated to provide services 
all capitation expenses are recorded as medical services in our consolidated statements of income 
as noted above  many of our primary care physicians are paid on a capitation basis  while others are paid on a fee for service basis 
specialists and hospitals are paid for the most part on a fee for service basis 
physician providers paid on a fee for service basis are paid according to a fee schedule set by the state or by our contracts with these providers 
we pay hospitals in a variety of ways  including fee for service per diems  diagnostic related groups  percent of billed charges  and case rates and capitation 
under fee for service arrangements  we retain the financial responsibility for medical care provided at discounted payment rates 
expenses related to fee for service contracts are recorded in the period in which the related services are dispensed 
for the year ended december   approximately of our direct medical expenses were related to fees paid to providers on a fee for service basis  with the balance paid on a capitation basis 
medical care costs and medical claims and benefits payable are based upon actual historical experience and estimates of medical expenses incurred but not reported  or ibnr 
we estimate our ibnr monthly based on a number of factors  including prior claims experience  health care service utilization data  cost trends  product mix  seasonality  prior authorization of medical services  and other factors 
as part of this review  we also consider uncertainties related to fluctuations in provider billing patterns  claims payment patterns  membership  and medical cost trends 
we include loss adjustment expenses in the recorded claims liability 
we continually review and update the estimation methods and the resulting reserves 
many of our medical contracts are complex in nature and may be subject to differing interpretations regarding amounts due for the provision of various services 
such differing interpretations may not come to light until a substantial period of time has passed following the contract implementation  leading to potential misstatement of some costs in the period in which they are first recorded 
estimates are adjusted monthly as more information becomes available 
any adjustments to reserves are reflected in current operations 
we employ our own actuaries and engage the service of independent actuaries as needed 
we believe that our process for estimating ibnr is adequate  but all estimates are subject to uncertainties and our actual medical care costs have  in the past  exceeded such estimates 
our estimates of ibnr may be inadequate in the future  which would negatively affect our results of operations 
additionally  if we are unable to accurately estimate ibnr  our ability to take timely corrective actions may be affected  further exacerbating the extent of the negative impact on our results of operations 
g a costs are largely comprised of wage and benefit costs related to our employee base and other administrative expenses 
some g a services are provided locally  while others are delivered to our health plans from a centralized location 
the major centralized functions are claims processing  information systems  finance and accounting services  and legal and regulatory services 
locally provided functions include marketing to the extent permitted by law and regulation  plan administration  and provider relations 
included in g a expenses are premium taxes for the california hmo beginning july  the michigan hmo  the new mexico hmo 
table of contents beginning with its acquisition on july   the ohio hmo  the texas hmo beginning september  and the washington hmo 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected operating ratios 
all ratios with the exception of the medical care ratio are shown as a percentage of total revenue 
the medical care ratio is shown as a percentage of premium revenue because there is a direct relationship between the premium revenue earned and the cost of health care 
year ended december  premium revenue investment income total revenue medical care ratio general and administrative expense ratio  excluding premium taxes premium taxes included in general and administrative expenses total general and administrative expense ratio operating income net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  premium revenue premium revenue for was  million  an increase of million  or  over premium revenue for the year ended december   of  million 
acquisitions in california effective june  and michigan effective may  and the start up operation in ohio were the primary drivers of the increase in premium revenue 
the acquisition of cape health plan in michigan effective may  added million in premium revenue in the ohio health plan which had less than  of premium revenue in contributed million to premium revenue in  and premium revenue from the now terminated indiana health plan contributed million 
medicare advantage revenue for all of was million  of which million came from our utah health plan 
we had no medicare advantage revenue in the now terminated indiana health plan contributed million more in premium revenue in than in membership growth contributed million to the increase in premium revenue 
year end enrollment increased to  members at december  including subsequently discontinued indiana membership of  from  members at december  membership growth was primarily the result of our acquisition of cape health plan in michigan effective may  and the start up of our ohio  texas  and indiana hmos 
however  since the contract between our indiana hmo and the state of indiana expired on december   we no longer have any membership in indiana effective january  member months for the year ended december  increased by to  from  for the year ended december  the remaining million increase in premium revenue was attributable to increases in premium rates and proportionally greater increases in membership in those states with higher premium rates 
investment income investment income for was million as compared with million for  an increase of million as a result of higher invested balances and higher investment yields 

table of contents medical care costs medical care costs for were  million  as compared with  million for medical care costs as a percentage of premium revenue the medical care ratio  or mcr decreased to in as compared to in the decrease in the medical care ratio during was due to improved medical care ratios reported in our michigan excluding cape health plan  washington  and new mexico hmos 
partially offsetting the improved medical care ratios in these states was a basis points increase in the mcr in our california hmo in as compared to due to higher unit costs and limited premium rates 
in addition  cape health plan acquired effective may  experienced a higher medical care ratio during than our consolidated average 
the medical care ratios for our start up operations in ohio  texas  and indiana were substantially higher than that experienced by the company as a whole 
excluding these start up operations  our medical care ratio decreased basis points to for the year ended december  as compared with in we believe our medical care cost control initiatives contributed substantially to the year over year decrease in our medical care ratio 
the company anticipates significant growth in enrollment in the ohio health plan in and projects a lower ohio health plan medical care ratio as a result of re contracting and lower costs in new regions of that state 
our indiana health plan s medicaid contract expired on december  and we do not believe the wind up of our operations in indiana will have a material impact on our future operating results 
the texas health plan did not have significant enrollment until december of  and revenue and medical costs generated from the texas health plan did not have a material impact on our consolidated results for either the fourth quarter of or the full year of general and administrative expenses g a expenses for were million as compared with million for g a expenses as a percentage of total revenue were for as compared with for premium taxes which are included in g a increased to of total revenue in from of total revenue in increased premium taxes were due to the acquisition of hclb cape health plan in may  the start up ohio hmo which commenced operations in december and the full year effect of premium taxes in california commencing july  g a excluding premium taxes core g a increased to of total revenue for from of total revenue for the increase in core g a was due to continued investments in infrastructure to support our medical care cost control initiatives and improve our information technology  the expansion into ohio and texas  and the launch of our medicare advantage special needs plans 
effective january   we adopted sfas r  share based payment  which increased our g a expenses by million approximately per diluted share in depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense for increased to million from million for amortization expense increased by million in due to acquisitions in california and michigan 
depreciation expense increased by million in due to investments in infrastructure  principally at our corporate offices 
interest expense interest expense increased to million in from million in due to increased borrowings and higher interest rates during

the increase in our effective tax rate during was primarily attributable to the accrual of a valuation allowance related to net operating loss carryforwards generated by certain states 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  premium revenue premium revenue for was  million  up million from  million for membership growth contributed million to the increase in premium revenue 
year end enrollment increased to  members at december   from  members at the same date of the prior year 
membership growth was primarily the result of acquisitions in san diego  california effective june   the start up of our indiana hmo effective april   and the full year benefit of acquisitions made during in washington  new mexico  and michigan 
member months for the year ended december  increased by to  from  for the year ended december  the remaining million increase in premium revenue was attributable to increases in premium rates and proportionally greater increases in membership in those states with higher premium rates

hospital costs for include million of expense related to the settlement and anticipated settlement of certain claims made against us by various hospitals 
these claims seek additional or first time reimbursement for services ostensibly provided to our members that purportedly were not paid or were underpaid by us 
the claims made by these hospitals involve issues of contract compliance  interpretation  payment methodology and intent 
these claims extend to services provided over a number of years 
general and administrative expenses g a expenses for were million as compared with million for g a expenses as a percentage of total revenue were for as compared with for premium taxes which are included in g a increased to of total revenue in from of total revenue in increased premium taxes were due to the inclusion of our new mexico hmo in our

acquisitions on may   the company completed its acquisition of hclb  inc hclb 
hclb is the parent company of cape health plan  inc cape  a michigan corporation based in southfield  michigan 
cape serves approximately  medicaid members primarily in southeast michigan 
the cape acquisition has expanded our geographic presence within michigan 
the purchase price was million in cash and the acquisition was deemed effective may  for accounting purposes 
accordingly  the results of operations for cape are included in the consolidated financial statements for the periods following may  effective december   we merged cape into molina healthcare of michigan  inc  our michigan hmo 
liquidity and capital resources we generate cash from premium revenue  savings sharing income  services provided on a fee for service basis at our clinics  and investment income 
our primary uses of cash include the payment of expenses related to medical care services  g a expenses  and acquisitions 
we generally receive premium revenue in advance of payment of claims for related health care services  with the exception of our utah hmo 
additionally  because we generally receive premium revenue in advance of payment for the related medical care costs with the exception of our utah hmo  our cash has increased during periods when we experienced enrollment growth 
at december   we had working capital of million as compared to million at december  at december  and december   cash and cash equivalents were 
table of contents million and million  respectively 
at december  and december   our investments  all classified as current assets  were million and million  respectively 
at december   the parent company had cash and investments of million 
our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital prescribed by the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
as of december   all of our subsidiaries were in compliance with the minimum capital requirements 
barring any change in regulatory requirements  we believe that we will continue to be in compliance with these requirements at least through although the rapid growth of our ohio and texas hmos may require us to contribute substantial regulatory capital by the end of which is likely to exceed internally generated cash  we believe that our cash resources  internally generated funds  and amounts drawable under our credit facility together will be sufficient to support our operations  regulatory requirements  and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
our investment policies are designed to provide liquidity  preserve capital  and maximize total return on invested assets  all in a manner consistent with state requirements  which prescribe the types of instruments in which our subsidiaries may invest their funds 
as of december   we invested a substantial portion of our cash in a portfolio of highly liquid money market securities 
as of december   our investments consisted solely of investment grade debt securities  all of which are classified as current assets 
our investment policies require that all of our investments have final maturities of ten years or less excluding auction rate securities and variable rate securities  for which interest rates are periodically reset and that the average maturity be four years or less 
two professional portfolio managers operating under documented investment guidelines manage our investments 
the average annualized portfolio yield for the years ended december    and was approximately   and  respectively 
our restricted investments consist principally of certificates of deposit and treasury securities with maturities of up to months 
these investments are held to satisfy statutory deposit requirements at the various states in which we operate 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  as compared to million in  an increase of million 
the increase resulted from higher net income  increased deferred revenue at our ohio hmo and the timing of income tax payments 
partially offsetting these increases was an increase in receivables from our utah  california  and ohio hmos 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in as compared to cash used of million in the decrease in cash used of million in was driven by the acquisition of million in net cash as a result of the cape purchase in as compared to the payment of million net cash as a result of purchase transactions in net cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to cash used for financing activities of million in the increase in was due to borrowings under our million credit facility to fund capital infusions into our ohio  indiana  california  and texas hmos 
at december   we owed million under our million credit facility 
in november  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission covering the issuance of up to million of securities  including common stock or debt securities 
no securities have been issued under the shelf registration statement 
we may publicly offer securities from time to time at prices and terms to be determined at the time of the offering 
credit facility on march   we entered into an amended and restated five year secured credit agreement for a million revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders 
the credit facility is intended to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes 

table of contents the credit facility has a term of five years and all amounts outstanding under the credit facility will be due and payable on march  subject to obtaining commitments from existing or new lenders and satisfaction of other specified conditions  we may increase the credit facility to up to million 
borrowings under the credit facility are based  at our election  on the london interbank offering rate  or libor  or the base rate plus an applicable margin 
the base rate equals the higher of bank of america s prime rate or above the federal funds rate 
we also pay a commitment fee on the total unused commitments of the lenders under the credit facility 
the applicable margins and commitment fee are based on our ratio of consolidated funded debt to consolidated ebitda 
the applicable margins range between and for libor loans and between and for base rate loans 
the commitment fee ranges between and 
in addition  we are required to pay a fee for each letter of credit issued under the credit facility equal to the applicable margin for libor loans and a customary fronting fee 
our obligations under the credit facility are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets and by a pledge of the capital stock of our michigan  new mexico  utah  and washington hmo subsidiaries 
the credit agreement includes usual and customary covenants for credit facilities of this type  including covenants limiting liens  mergers  asset sales  other fundamental changes  debt  acquisitions  dividends and other distributions  capital expenditures  and investments 
the credit agreement also requires us to maintain certain fixed charge coverage ratios 
at december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants in the credit agreement 
regulatory capital and dividend restrictions at december   our principal operations were conducted through the seven hmos operating in california  michigan  new mexico  ohio  texas  utah  and washington 
the hmos are subject to state laws that  among other things  may require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital  as defined by each state  and restrict the timing  payment  and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us as their sole stockholder 
to the extent the subsidiaries must comply with these regulations  they may not have the financial flexibility to transfer funds to us 
the net assets in these subsidiaries  after intercompany eliminations  which may not be transferable to us in the form of loans  advances  or cash dividends was million at december   and million at december  the national association of insurance commissioners has adopted rules effective december   which  if implemented by the states  set new minimum capitalization requirements for insurance companies  hmos  and other entities bearing risk for health care coverage 
the requirements take the form of risk based capital rules 
these hmo rules  which may vary from state to state  have been adopted in michigan  new mexico  indiana  ohio  texas  utah and washington 
california has not adopted risk based capital requirements for hmos and has not formally given notice of its intention to do so 
the national association of insurance commissioners hmo rules  if adopted by california  may increase the minimum capital required for that state 
as of december   our hmos had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately million  compared with the required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately million 
all of our hmos were in compliance with the minimum capital requirements 
critical accounting policies when we prepare our consolidated financial statements  we use estimates and assumptions that may affect reported amounts and disclosures 
the determination of our liability for claims and medical benefits payable is particularly important to the determination of our financial position and results of operations and requires the application of significant judgment by our management and  as a result  is subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 

table of contents our medical care costs include amounts that have actually been paid by us through the reporting date as well as estimated liabilities for medical care costs incurred but not paid by us as of the reporting date 
such medical care cost liabilities include  among other items  capitation payments owed providers  unpaid pharmacy invoices and various medically related administrative costs that have been incurred but not paid 
we also record reserves for estimated referral claims related to medical groups under contract with us that are financially troubled or insolvent and that may not be able to honor their obligations for the payment of medical services provided by other providers 
in these instances  we may be required to honor these obligations for legal or business reasons 
based on our current assessment of providers under contract with us  such losses are not expected to be significant 
in applying this policy  we use judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions for determining the required estimates 
the most important part in estimating our medical care costs  however  is our estimate for fee for service claims which have been incurred but not paid by us 
these fee for service costs that have been incurred but are not paid at the reporting date are collectively referred to as medical costs that are incurred but not reported  or ibnr 
we estimate these medical claims liabilities using actuarial methods based upon historical claims payment data 
we adjust that data to account for changes in payment patterns  cost trends  changes in product mix  seasonality  changes in utilization of health care services  information provided by our providers  and other relevant factors 
in assessing the adequacy of accruals for medical claims liabilities  we consider our historical experience  the terms of existing contracts  our knowledge of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers  and information available from other sources  as appropriate 
the estimation methods and the resulting reserves are frequently reviewed and updated  and adjustments  if necessary  are reflected in the period known 
while we believe our current estimates are adequate  we have in the past been required to make a significant adjustment to these estimates and it is possible that we will be required to make significant adjustments or revisions to these estimates in the future 
the most significant estimates involved in determining our ibnr liability concern the determination of claims payment completion factors and trended per member per month cost estimates 
for the fifth month of service prior to the reporting date and earlier  we estimate our outstanding claims liability based upon actual claims paid  adjusted for estimated completion factors 
completion factors seek to measure the cumulative percentage of claims expense that will have been paid for a given month of service as of the reporting date based on historical payment patterns 
the following table reflects the change in our estimate of claims liability as of december  that would have resulted had we changed our completion factors for the fifth through the twelfth months preceding december  by the percentages indicated 
a reduction in the completion factor results in an increase in medical claims liabilities 
our utah hmo is excluded from these calculations  as the majority of the utah business is conducted under a cost reimbursement contract 
our acquisition of cape health plan  effective may   is excluded from these calculations because our statements of income only includes cape health plan since the acquisition date 
dollar amounts are in thousands 
decrease increase in estimated completion factors increase decrease in medical claims and benefits payable 
table of contents for the four months of service immediately prior to the reporting date  actual claims paid are not a reliable measure of our ultimate liability  given the inherent delay between the patient physician encounter and the actual submission of a claim for payment 
for these months of service  we estimate our claims liability based upon trended per member per month pmpm cost estimates 
these estimates are designed to reflect recent trends in payments and expense  utilization patterns  authorized services  and other relevant factors 
the following table reflects the change in our estimate of claims liability as of december  that would have resulted had we altered our trend factors by the percentages indicated 
an increase in the pmpm costs results in an increase in medical claims liabilities 
our utah hmo is excluded from these calculations  as the majority of the utah business is conducted under a cost reimbursement contract 
cape health plan  which was acquired on may   is included in these calculations 
dollar amounts are in thousands 
decrease increase in trended per member per month cost estimates decrease increase in medical claims and benefits payable assuming a hypothetical change in completion factors from those used in our calculation of ibnr at december   net income for the year ended december  would increase or decrease by approximately million  or per diluted share  net of tax 
assuming a hypothetical change in pmpm cost estimates from those used in our calculation of ibnr at december   net income for the year ended december  would increase or decrease by approximately million  or per diluted share  net of tax 
commitments and contingencies we lease office space and equipment under various operating leases 
as of december   our lease obligations for the next five years and thereafter are as follows million in  million in  million in  million in  million in  and an aggregate of million thereafter 
we are not an obligor to or guarantor of any indebtedness of any other party 
we are not a party to off balance sheet financing arrangements except for operating leases which are disclosed in the commitments and contingencies section of our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report and the notes thereto 
we have in the past made certain advances and loans to related parties  which are discussed in the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report and the notes thereto 
contractual obligations in the table below  we set forth our contractual obligations as of december  some of the figures we include in this table are based on management s estimates and assumptions about these obligations  including their duration  the possibility of renewal  anticipated actions by third parties  and other factors 
because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective  the contractual obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table 
amounts are in thousands 
and beyond long term debt operating lease obligations purchase commitments total contractual obligations 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  receivables  and restricted investments 
we invest a substantial portion of our cash in a portfolio of highly liquid money market securities 
professional portfolio managers operating under documented investment guidelines manage our investments 
restricted investments are invested principally in certificates of deposit 
concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited due to payors consisting principally of the governments of each state in which our hmo subsidiaries operate 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  investments of million  and restricted investments of million 
the cash equivalents consist of highly liquid securities with original maturities of up to three months that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash 
as of december   our investments consisted solely of investment grade debt securities  all of which were classified as current assets 
our investment policies require that all of our investments have final maturities of ten years or less excluding auction rate and variable rate securities where interest rates are periodically reset and that the average maturity be four years or less 
the restricted investments consist of interest bearing deposits and treasury securities required by the respective states in which we operate 
investments and restricted investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase 
all non restricted investments are reported at fair market value on the balance sheet 
all restricted investments are carried at amortized cost  which approximates market value 
we have the ability to hold these restricted investments until maturity and  as a result  we would not expect the value of these investments to decline significantly due to a sudden change in market interest rates 
declines in interest rates over time will reduce our investment income 
inflation we use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of health care cost inflation 
specifically  our health plans try to control medical and hospital costs through contracts with independent providers of health care services 
through these contracted providers  our health plans emphasize preventive health care and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services 
while we currently believe our strategies will mitigate health care cost inflation  competitive pressures  new health care and pharmaceutical product introductions  demands from health care providers and customers  applicable regulations  or other factors may affect our ability to control health care costs 
compliance costs our health plans are regulated by both state and federal government agencies 
regulation of managed care products and health care services is an evolving area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
regulatory agencies generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules 
changes in applicable laws and rules occur frequently 
compliance with such laws and rules may lead to additional costs related to the implementation of additional systems  procedures and programs that we have not yet identified
