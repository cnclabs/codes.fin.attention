and many others 
we have adopted a fifty two fifty three week fiscal year ending on the sunday nearest march fiscal years and each comprised fifty two weeks and fiscal year comprised fifty three weeks 
business combinations silverstorm technologies in november  we acquired silverstorm technologies  inc silverstorm by merger 
cash consideration was million  including million for all outstanding silverstorm common stock  vested stock options and stock warrants and million for direct acquisition costs 
silverstorm provided end to end  high performance interconnect fabric solutions for cluster and grid computing networks 
the acquisition of silverstorm expanded our portfolio of infiniband solutions to include edge fabric switches and multi protocol fabric directors 
the acquisition agreement required that million of the consideration paid be placed into escrow for months in connection with certain standard representations and warranties 
we accounted for the escrowed amount as contingent consideration and  as such  have not recorded it as a component of the purchase price as the outcome of the related contingencies is not yet determinable beyond a reasonable doubt 
upon satisfaction of the contingency  the escrowed amount will be recorded as additional purchase price and allocated to goodwill 

table of contents based on a preliminary purchase price allocation  we allocated the total purchase consideration to the tangible assets  liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired as well as purchased in process research and development ipr d  based on their respective fair values at the acquisition date 
the excess of the purchase price over the aggregate fair values was recorded as goodwill 
none of the goodwill resulting from this acquisition will be tax deductible 
we are in the process of finalizing the valuation of the intangible assets acquired and expect to finalize the purchase price allocation in fiscal  which may result in adjustments to the amounts recorded principally related to the availability of net operating loss carryforwards and other tax benefits from the acquisition 
pathscale in april  we acquired pathscale  inc pathscale by merger 
pathscale designed and developed system area network fabric interconnects targeted at high performance clustered system environments 
the acquisition of pathscale expanded our portfolio to include infiniband solutions 
consideration for this acquisition was million  including million related to pathscale unvested stock options assumed by qlogic 
cash consideration was million  including million for all outstanding pathscale common stock and vested stock options and million for direct acquisition costs 
the acquisition agreement required that million of the consideration paid be placed into escrow for months in connection with certain standard representations and warranties 
we accounted for the escrowed amount as contingent consideration and  as such  have not recorded it as a component of the purchase price as the outcome of the related contingencies is not yet determinable beyond a reasonable doubt 
upon satisfaction of the contingency  the escrowed amount will be recorded as additional purchase price and allocated to goodwill 
we also converted unvested pathscale stock options for continuing employees into options to purchase  shares of qlogic common stock with a weighted average exercise price of per share 
the total fair value of the options at the date of conversion was million  calculated using the black scholes option pricing model 
we have accounted for million of the value of the converted stock options as consideration for the acquisition to reflect the related employee services rendered through the date of the acquisition and the balance will be expensed over the remaining service period 
based on the purchase price allocation  we allocated the total purchase consideration to the tangible assets  liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired as well as ipr d based on their respective fair values at the acquisition date 
the excess of the purchase price over the aggregate fair values was recorded as goodwill 
none of the goodwill resulting from this acquisition will be tax deductible 
we also entered into performance plans with certain former pathscale employees who became employees of qlogic as of the acquisition date 
the performance plans provide for the issuance of qlogic common stock based on the achievement of certain performance milestones and continued employment with qlogic 
in connection with the performance plans  we recognized million of compensation expense during fiscal  and could recognize up to million of additional compensation expense through april troika networks in november  we completed the purchase of substantially all of the assets of troika networks  inc troika for million in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities 
the assets acquired included intellectual property including patents and trademarks  inventory and property and equipment 
troika developed  marketed and sold a storage services platform that hosted third party software solutions 
the acquisition of troika expanded our product line and  through the acquired intellectual property  enhanced certain of our current products  thereby providing greater functionality to our customers 
the consideration paid in excess of the fair market value of the tangible net assets acquired totaled million 
based on a preliminary purchase price allocation in fiscal  we recorded goodwill of million and core technology of million and recognized a charge of million for ipr d 
during fiscal  we finalized our valuation of the intangible assets acquired resulting in an increase in core technology of million  an increase in ipr d of million and a corresponding decrease in goodwill of million 
as this acquisition was an asset purchase  the goodwill resulting from this acquisition will be tax deductible 

table of contents in addition  we entered into a performance plan with certain former troika employees upon their employment with qlogic 
the performance plan provides for the issuance of qlogic common stock based on the achievement of certain performance milestones and continued employment with qlogic 
in connection with the performance plan  we recognized million and million of compensation expense during fiscal and  respectively  and could recognize up to million of additional compensation expense through november during fiscal  we issued  shares of common stock valued at million under this performance plan 
stock based compensation as of the beginning of fiscal  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and non employee directors including stock options  restricted stock units and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan based on estimated fair values 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method and consequently have not retroactively adjusted results from prior periods 
a summary of stock based compensation expense  excluding stock based compensation related to acquisitions  for fiscal recorded under sfas no 
r by functional line item is as follows in millions cost of revenues engineering and development sales and marketing general and administrative in fiscal and  there was no stock based compensation expense  excluding stock based compensation related to acquisitions  as we had not yet adopted sfas no 
r or the recognition provisions of sfas no 
stock based compensation expense related to acquisitions of million for fiscal is excluded from the above table 
during fiscal and  we recorded stock based compensation expense of million and million  respectively  related to acquisitions 
discontinued operations in november  we completed the sale of our hard disk drive controller and tape drive controller business  or the discontinued business  to marvell technology group ltd 
marvell for cash and shares of marvell s common stock 
as a result of this transaction  all financial information related to the discontinued business has been presented as discontinued operations 
the following discussion and analysis excludes the discontinued business and amounts related to the discontinued business unless otherwise noted 
fiscal year and fourth quarter financial highlights and other information during fiscal  our net revenues increased from the prior year to million and were highlighted by a increase in revenues from san infrastructure products  which are comprised primarily of hbas  switches and silicon chips 
during fiscal  we continued the transition of our fibre channel hbas from gb to gb and introduced new products such as our sanbox switch 
in addition  the acquisitions of pathscale and silverstorm in fiscal expanded our product portfolio to include infiniband technology 

table of contents a summary of the key factors and significant events which impacted our financial performance during the fourth quarter of fiscal are as follows net revenues of million for the fourth quarter of fiscal increased by million  or  from million in the fourth quarter of fiscal revenues from san infrastructure products during the fourth quarter increased from the comparable quarter in the prior year and represented of our total net revenues 
gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was in the fourth quarter  a decrease from for the fourth quarter of fiscal we continue to expect downward pressure on our gross profit percentage primarily as a result of changes in product and technology mix  as well as declining average selling prices 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our gross profit percentage consistent with historical periods and it may decline in the future 
operating income as a percentage of net revenues was for the fourth quarter of fiscal  compared to during the fourth quarter of fiscal operating income for the fourth quarter was impacted by stock based compensation charges of million  amortization of purchased intangible assets related to our acquisitions of million and purchased in process research and development charges of million 
income from continuing operations was million  or per diluted share  in the fourth quarter of fiscal and decreased from million  or per diluted share  reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal income from continuing operations included stock based compensation expense  acquisition related charges  impairment charges related to marketable securities  and the related income tax effects  totaling million for the fourth quarter of fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  income from continuing operations included acquisition related charges  the gain on sale of shares acquired in the sale of discontinued operations  and the related income tax effects  totaling million 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million at april  decreased million from million at april  this decrease is primarily due to repurchases of our common stock and cash paid for acquisitions  partially offset by cash flow from operations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we generated million of cash from continuing operations 
accounts receivable was million as of april   compared to million as of april  days sales outstanding dso in receivables as of april  decreased to days from days as of april  our accounts receivable and dso are primarily affected by linearity of shipments within the quarter and collections performance 
based on our customers procurement models and our current customer mix  we expect that dso in the future will range from to days 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our dso consistent with historical periods and it may increase in the future 
inventories were million as of april   compared to million as of april  our annualized inventory turns in the fourth quarter of fiscal of turns increased from the turns in the fourth quarter of fiscal 
table of contents results of operations net revenues a summary of the components of our net revenues is as follows dollars in millions net revenues san infrastructure products management controllers other total net revenues percentage of net revenues san infrastructure products management controllers other total net revenues the global marketplace for sans continues to expand in response to the information storage requirements of enterprise business environments  as well as the emerging market for san based solutions for small and medium sized businesses 
this market expansion has resulted in increased volume shipments of our san infrastructure products 
however  the san market has been characterized by rapid advances in technology and related product performance  which has generally resulted in declining average selling prices over time 
our revenues have generally been favorably affected by increases in units sold as a result of market expansion  increases in market share and the release of new products 
the favorable effect on our revenues as a result of increases in volume has been partially offset by the impact of declining average selling prices 
our net revenues are derived primarily from the sale of san infrastructure products 
net revenues for fiscal increased to million from million for fiscal this increase was primarily the result of a million  or  increase in revenue from san infrastructure products  partially offset by an million decrease in revenue from management controllers 
the increase in revenue from san infrastructure products was primarily due to a increase in the number of units of fibre channel and iscsi hbas sold partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices of these products  and a increase in the number of units of fibre channel switches sold partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices of fibre channel switches 
revenue from management controllers decreased from the prior year due primarily to a decrease in the number of units sold 
net revenues for fiscal included million of other revenue 
other revenue  which includes royalties  non recurring engineering fees and service fees  is unpredictable and we do not expect it to be significant to our overall revenues 
overall  based on a foundation of design wins for our existing and emerging products  and forecasts provided by customers  we expect to achieve continued growth in our year to year net revenues in fiscal we believe the revenue growth anticipated from our hba and switch products will be partially offset by the expected declines in revenue from management controllers and other fibre channel silicon products 
we expect revenue from management controllers  which was million for fiscal  to continue to decrease significantly in fiscal  as these products are not part of our core business and we are not investing in the development of new products 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  our net revenue from management controllers was million and we expect quarterly sequential declines in this revenue will continue during fiscal the expected decline in revenue from fibre channel silicon products is primarily the result of the transition by certain customers to alternative technologies  such as serial attached scsi sas and serial advanced technology attachment sata 
we do not sell products using sas and sata technology and currently have no intention to invest in these technologies 

table of contents net revenues for fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal this increase was primarily the result of a million  or  increase in revenue from san infrastructure products  partially offset by a million  or  decrease in revenue from management controllers 
the increase in revenue from san infrastructure products was primarily due to a increase in the number of units of fibre channel and iscsi hbas sold partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices of these products and a increase in the number of units of fibre channel switches sold partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices of these products 
the decrease in revenue from management controllers was due to a decrease in the number of units sold and a decrease in average selling prices 
net revenues for fiscal included million of other revenue 
a small number of our customers account for a substantial portion of our net revenues  and we expect that a limited number of customers will continue to represent a substantial portion of our net revenues for the foreseeable future 
our top ten customers accounted for  and of net revenues during fiscal  and  respectively 
a summary of our customers  including their manufacturing subcontractors  that represent or more of our net revenues for any of the fiscal years presented is as follows ibm hewlett packard sun microsystems dell less than of net revenues 
we believe that our major customers continually evaluate whether or not to purchase products from alternative or additional sources 
additionally  customers economic and market conditions frequently change 
accordingly  there can also be no assurance that a major customer will not reduce  delay or eliminate its purchases from us 
any such reduction  delay or loss of purchases could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
revenues by geographic area are presented based upon the country of destination 
no individual country other than the united states represented or more of net revenues for any of the fiscal years presented 
net revenues by geographic area are as follows in millions united states europe  middle east and africa asia pacific and japan rest of world gross profit gross profit represents net revenues less cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of purchased products  assembly and test services  costs associated with product procurement  inventory management and product quality  and the amortization of purchased intangible assets 
a summary of our gross profit and related percentage of net revenues is as follows dollars in millions gross profit percentage of net revenues 
table of contents gross profit for fiscal increased million  or  from gross profit for fiscal  primarily due to the increase in net revenues 
the gross profit percentage for fiscal was and declined from for the prior year 
this decrease in gross profit percentage was due primarily to a million increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets related to our acquisitions and million of stock based compensation related to the adoption of sfas no 
r in fiscal the decline in gross profit percentage was also impacted by an unfavorable shift in product and technology mix  as well as a decrease in the average selling prices of our products 
gross profit for fiscal increased million  or  from gross profit for fiscal the gross profit percentage for fiscal was and declined from in the prior year 
the decline in gross profit percentage was principally due to an unfavorable shift in product and technology mix  as well as a decrease in the average selling prices of our products 
our ability to maintain our current gross profit percentage can be significantly affected by factors such as the results of our investment in engineering and development activities  supply costs  the worldwide semiconductor foundry capacity  the mix of products shipped  the transition to new products  competitive price pressures  the timeliness of volume shipments of new products  the level of royalties received  our ability to achieve manufacturing cost reductions and amortization of purchased intangible assets 
we anticipate that it will be increasingly difficult to reduce manufacturing costs 
as a result of these and other factors  it may be difficult to maintain our gross profit percentage consistent with historical periods and it may decline in the future 
operating expenses our operating expenses are summarized in the following table dollars in millions operating expenses engineering and development sales and marketing general and administrative purchased in process research and development total operating expenses percentage of net revenues engineering and development sales and marketing general and administrative purchased in process research and development total operating expenses engineering and development 
engineering and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefit costs  development related engineering and material costs  occupancy costs and related computer support costs 
during fiscal  engineering and development expenses of million increased million  or  from fiscal the increase in engineering and development expenses was due primarily to million of stock based compensation  excluding stock based compensation related to acquisitions  in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
r in fiscal  a million increase in cash compensation and related benefit costs associated with increases in headcount due to our acquisitions and in connection with our expanded development efforts in support of new products  a million increase in acquisition related stock based compensation charges  and a million increase in depreciation and equipment costs 
during fiscal  engineering and development expenses of million increased million  or  from fiscal the increase in engineering and development expenses was primarily due to a million increase in cash compensation and related benefit costs associated with increases in headcount for our expanded development efforts in support of new products  including an increase in headcount due to the acquisition of troika 
table of contents during the third quarter of fiscal  a million increase in external engineering costs associated with new product development  a million increase in equipment and supplies costs  and million of acquisition related stock based compensation charges related to the acquisition of troika  partially offset by a reduction of million of acquisition related stock based compensation charges incurred during fiscal related to the acquisition of the little mountain group  inc the acquisition related stock based compensation related to the little mountain group acquisition ended in the fourth quarter of fiscal we believe continued investments in engineering and development activities are critical to achieving future design wins  expansion of our customer base and revenue growth opportunities 
we expect engineering and development expenses will continue to increase in the future as a result of continued  and increasing costs associated with  new product development  including our recent acquisitions 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefit costs  sales commissions  promotional activities and travel for sales and marketing personnel 
sales and marketing expenses for fiscal of million increased million  or  from fiscal the increase in sales and marketing expenses was due primarily to million of stock based compensation  excluding stock based compensation related to acquisitions  in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
r in fiscal  a million increase in cash compensation and related benefit costs due to increased headcount associated with the expansion of our sales and marketing groups  a million increase in promotional costs  which included the costs for our worldwide partner conferences  trade shows and other marketing programs  amortization of purchased intangible assets of million related to customer relationships  and an increase in acquisition related stock based compensation charges of million 
sales and marketing expenses for fiscal of million increased million  or  from fiscal the increase in sales and marketing expenses was due primarily to a million increase in various promotional activities directed at increasing market awareness and acceptance of our products  a million increase in the compensation and related benefit costs due to increased headcount associated with the expansion of our sales and marketing groups  a million increase in commissions expense as a result of higher revenues and a million increase in travel related expenses 
we believe continued investments in our sales and marketing organizational infrastructure and related marketing programs are critical to the success of our strategy of expanding our customer base and enhancing relationships with our existing customers 
as a result  we expect sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in the future 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefit costs for executive  finance  accounting  human resources  legal and information technology personnel 
non compensation components of general and administrative expenses include accounting  legal and other professional fees  facilities expenses and other corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal of million increased million  or  from fiscal primarily due to million of stock based compensation in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
r in the current fiscal year  an increase of million in cash compensation and related benefit costs due to increased headcount  and an increase of million in accounting and legal fees 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal of million increased million  or  from fiscal and included an increase of million in outside consulting services  primarily related to the structuring of our expanded international operations  partially offset by a million reimbursement received from an insurance carrier related to the settlement of a prior legal matter and a decrease in bad debt expense of million 
in connection with the growth of our business  we expect general and administrative expenses will increase in the future 
purchased in process research and development 
in connection with our acquisitions  we recorded million and million of ipr d charges during fiscal and  respectively 
the amounts allocated to ipr d were determined through established valuation techniques used in the high technology industry and were expensed upon acquisition as it was determined that the underlying projects had not reached technological feasibility and no alternative future uses existed 

table of contents the fair value of the ipr d for each of the acquisitions was determined using the income approach 
under the income approach  the expected future cash flows from each project under development are estimated and discounted to their net present values at an appropriate risk adjusted rate of return 
significant factors considered in the calculation of the rate of return are the weighted average cost of capital and return on assets  as well as the risks inherent in the development process  including the likelihood of achieving technological success and market acceptance 
each project was analyzed to determine the unique technological innovations  the existence and reliance on core technology  the existence of any alternative future use or current technological feasibility  and the complexity  cost and time to complete the remaining development 
future cash flows for each project were estimated based on forecasted revenue and costs  taking into account product life cycles  and market penetration and growth rates 
as of april   we had one incomplete ipr d project from each of the fiscal acquisitions 
these projects are estimated to be complete and are expected to be completed in fiscal the estimated cost to complete these projects is between million and million 
interest and other income  net components of our interest and other income  net are as follows in millions interest income gain on sales of marketable securities loss on sales of marketable securities impairment of marketable securities other interest and other income for fiscal of million was comprised principally of interest income of million related to our portfolio of marketable securities  partially offset by an million impairment charge on marketable securities and million of net realized losses on sales of marketable debt securities 
we reviewed various factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge related to our unrealized losses in marketable securities  including the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer of the marketable security  the magnitude of the unrealized loss compared to the cost of the investment  the length of time the investment has been in a loss position and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of market value 
based on this analysis  we determined that the unrealized losses were other than temporary and recorded an impairment charge on our marketable securities 
as of april   there were no remaining unrealized losses on our portfolio of marketable securities 
interest and other income for fiscal of million was comprised principally of interest income of million related to our marketable securities 
interest income increased by million due to increasing yields on our portfolio of marketable securities  as well as larger investment balances 
interest and other income for fiscal also includes an million gain on the sale of a portion of the shares of marvell common stock acquired as part of the sale of our hard disk drive controller and tape drive controller business  partially offset by million of net realized losses on sales of marketable debt securities 
income taxes our effective income tax rate related to continuing operations was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in the estimated annual effective tax rate for fiscal is primarily due to a greater percentage of worldwide income being attributable to foreign operations and taxed in jurisdictions outside of the united states  the settlement of routine tax examinations and the reversal of a reserve as a result of the expiration of the federal statute of limitations on an open tax year 
the increase in the tax rate in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to investments by foreign subsidiaries in intellectual property rights previously held by the united states parent and in newly acquired intellectual property rights  investments in 
table of contents foreign operations and the continued reduction in benefits derived from both the extraterritorial income exclusion and research credits 
during fiscal  we expect our effective tax rate to continue to benefit from our investment in foreign operations 
however  our effective tax rate may be negatively impacted by the tax effects of acquisitions and the accounting for stock based compensation under sfas no 
r 
in addition  our effective income tax rate in fiscal included certain favorable benefits which may not recur 
accordingly  we expect our effective income tax rate to increase in fiscal given the increased global scope of our operations  and the complexity of global tax and transfer pricing rules and regulations  it has become increasingly difficult to estimate earnings within each tax jurisdiction 
if actual earnings within each tax jurisdiction differ materially from our estimates  we may not achieve our expected effective income tax rate 
discontinued operations in november  we completed the sale of our hard disk drive controller and tape drive controller business to marvell 
in connection with this transaction  we recognized a gain on sale before income taxes of million 
income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes  consists of direct revenues and direct expenses of the discontinued business  including cost of revenues  as well as other fixed and allocated costs to the extent that such costs were eliminated as a result of the transaction 
general corporate overhead costs have not been allocated to discontinued operations 
a summary of the operating results of the discontinued business included in discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income is as follows in millions net revenues income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes gain on sale of discontinued operations  net of income taxes as the sale of the discontinued business closed in november  net revenues and income from discontinued operations for fiscal do not include a full year of operating activity 
net revenues for fiscal decreased million  or  from fiscal and income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes  for fiscal decreased by million  or 
liquidity and capital resources our combined balances of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased to million at april   compared to million at april  the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities is due primarily to the repurchase of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program and the acquisitions of pathscale and silverstorm  partially offset by cash generated by continuing operations 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and expected cash flow from operations will provide sufficient funds to finance our operations for at least the next months 
however  it is possible that we may need to supplement our existing sources of liquidity to finance our activities beyond the next months or for the future acquisition of businesses  products or technologies 
in addition  our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including changes in the markets we address  our revenues and the related manufacturing and operating costs  product development efforts and requirements for production capacity 
in order to fund any additional capital requirements  we may seek to obtain debt financing or issue additional shares of our common stock 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing  if necessary  will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
cash provided by continuing operating activities was million for fiscal and million for fiscal cash provided by continuing operating activities increased notwithstanding a decrease in income from continuing operations as non cash charges stock based compensation  depreciation and amortization  acquisition related charges  impairment of marketable securities  deferred income taxes and other increased million from the prior year 
operating cash flow for fiscal reflects our income from continuing operations of 
table of contents million and net non cash charges of million  offset by a net increase in the non cash components of working capital of million 
excluding assets acquired and liabilities assumed related to our acquisitions  non cash components of working capital increased primarily due to a million decrease in accounts payable and other current liabilities and a million increase in accounts receivable  partially offset by a million increase in deferred revenue  a million increase in income taxes payable and a million decrease in inventories 
the decrease in accounts payable and other current liabilities was primarily due to the timing of payment obligations and the increases in accounts receivable and deferred revenue were associated with the expansion of our business 
cash used in continuing investing activities was million for fiscal and consisted of net cash outflows of million for the acquisition of pathscale and million for the acquisition of silverstorm  including amounts placed in escrow related to acquisitions of million  and additions to property and equipment of million  partially offset by net sales and maturities of marketable securities of million and the receipt of million from an escrow account related to the sale of our hard disk drive controller and tape drive controller business 
during fiscal  cash provided by continuing investing activities of million consisted of net sales and maturities of marketable securities of million  partially offset by cash outflows of million for the acquisition of troika  additions to property and equipment of million  and million placed in escrow related to the sale of our hard disk drive controller and tape drive controller business 
as our business grows  we expect capital expenditures to increase in the future as we continue to invest in machinery and equipment  more costly engineering and production tools for new technologies  and enhancements to our corporate information technology infrastructure 
cash used in continuing financing activities of million for fiscal resulted primarily from our purchase of million of common stock under our stock repurchase program and the repayment of a million line of credit assumed in the silverstorm acquisition  partially offset by million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans and a related million tax benefit 
during fiscal  the million of cash used in continuing financing activities resulted from the use of million for the purchase of common stock under our stock repurchase programs  partially offset by million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans 
cash provided by discontinued operations was million for fiscal and included million of net proceeds from the sale of the discontinued business offset by million of net cash used in discontinued operating activities  which was primarily due to income tax payments related to the gain on sale of the discontinued business 
there were no cash flows from discontinued operations during fiscal from fiscal through fiscal  we had various stock repurchase programs that authorized us to purchase up to million of our outstanding common stock 
as of april   we had repurchased a total of million shares of common stock under these programs for an aggregate purchase price of million 
subsequent to april   we repurchased the remaining million under these programs  consisting of million shares 
in april  our board of directors also approved a new program to repurchase up to an additional million of our outstanding common stock 
we have certain contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments in the form of non cancelable purchase orders to our suppliers and commitments under operating lease arrangements 
a summary of our contractual obligations as of april   and their impact on our cash flows in future fiscal years  is as follows thereafter total in millions operating leases non cancelable purchase obligations total additionally  we have entered into an operating lease for a facility in minnesota  which is currently under construction 
the facility is expected to be completed during our third quarter of fiscal the future minimum lease payments associated with this lease are dependent upon the final cost of construction and  accordingly  have 
table of contents not been presented in the table above 
however  based on preliminary estimates  we expect to pay approximately million over the ten and one half year lease term 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we believe the accounting policies described below to be our most critical accounting policies 
these accounting policies are affected significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when the following fundamental criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and iv collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured 
for all sales  we use a binding purchase order or a signed agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
delivery occurs when goods are shipped and title and risk of loss transfer to the customer  in accordance with the terms specified in the arrangement with the customer 
the customer s obligation to pay and the payment terms are set at the time of delivery and are not dependent on the subsequent resale of our product 
however  certain of our sales are made to distributors under agreements which contain a limited right to return unsold product and price protection provisions 
we recognize revenue from these distributors based on the sell through method using inventory information provided by the distributor 
at times  we provide standard incentive programs to our distributor customers and account for such programs in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
accordingly  we account for our competitive pricing incentives  which generally reflect front end price adjustments  as a reduction of revenue at the time of sale  and rebates as a reduction of revenue in the period the related revenue is recorded based on the specific program criteria and historical experience 
royalty and service revenue is recognized when earned and receipt is reasonably assured 
for those sales that include multiple deliverables  we allocate revenue based on the relative fair values of the individual components as determined in accordance with eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
when more than one element  such as hardware and services  are contained in a single arrangement  we allocate revenue between the elements based on each element s relative fair value  provided that each element meets the criteria for treatment as a separate unit of accounting 
an item is considered a separate unit of accounting if it has value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
fair value is generally determined based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately 
in the absence of fair value for a delivered element  we allocate revenue first to the fair value of the undelivered elements and allocate the residual revenue to the delivered elements 
in the absence of fair value for an undelivered element  the arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting  resulting in a deferral of revenue recognition for the delivered elements until all undelivered elements have been fulfilled 
we sell certain software products and related post contract customer support pcs  and account for these transactions in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended 
we recognize revenue from software products when the following fundamental criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and iv collection of the resulting accounts receivable is probable 
revenue is allocated to each element based upon vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of the element 
vsoe of the fair value is based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately 
revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria are met for each 
table of contents element 
if we are unable to determine vsoe of fair value for pcs  the entire amount of revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the pcs 
amounts billed or payments received in advance of revenue recognition are deferred until the recognition criteria are met 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this reserve is determined by analyzing specific customer accounts and applying historical loss rates to the aging of remaining accounts receivable balances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to pay their accounts when due  additional reserves might be required 
we record provisions against revenue and cost of revenue for estimated product returns and allowances such as competitive pricing programs and rebates in the same period that revenue is recognized 
these provisions are based on historical experience as well as specifically identified product returns and allowance programs 
additional reductions to revenue would result if actual product returns or pricing adjustments exceed our estimates 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
we write down the carrying value of our inventory to estimated net realizable value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
once we write down the carrying value of inventory  a new cost basis is established 
subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in an increase in the newly established cost basis 
we compare current inventory levels on a product basis to our current sales forecasts in order to assess our inventory balance 
our sales forecasts are based on economic conditions and trends both current and projected  anticipated customer demand and acceptance of our current products  expected future products and other assumptions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
we record liabilities for probable income tax assessments based on our estimate of potential tax related exposures 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for us or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional liabilities or potentially to reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
differences between actual results and our assumptions  or changes in our assumptions in future periods  are recorded in the period they become known 
deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences using enacted statutory tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
temporary differences include the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent management believes that recovery is more likely than not  we do not establish a valuation allowance 
an adjustment to income would occur if we determine that we are able to realize a different amount of our deferred tax assets than currently expected 

table of contents stock based compensation effective april   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

r using the modified prospective transition method and consequently have not retroactively adjusted results from prior periods 
under this transition method  compensation cost associated with stock based awards recognized beginning in fiscal includes amortization related to the remaining unvested portion of stock based awards granted prior to the adoption of sfas no

in effect at the time of grant  and amortization related to stock based awards granted subsequent to the adoption date based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we recognize stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period for stock options and restricted stock unit awards  and the offering period for the espp 
sfas no 
r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated financial statements 
the determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable 
however  our employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of their fair value 
goodwill we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill is recorded as the difference  if any  between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to intangible assets acquired  other than goodwill  impact the amount and timing of future amortization  and the amount assigned to in process research and development is expensed immediately 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill not be amortized but instead be tested at least annually for impairment  or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired  by comparing the carrying value to the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned 
a two step test is used to identify the potential impairment and to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
the first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is considered not impaired  otherwise  goodwill is impaired and the loss is measured by performing step two 
under step two  the impairment loss is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying amount of goodwill 
we perform the annual test for impairment as of the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter and utilize the two step process 
the initial recording and subsequent evaluation for impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible assets requires the use of significant management judgment regarding the forecasts of future operating results 
it is possible that our business plans may change and our estimates used may prove to be inaccurate 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses  are lower than original estimates used  we could incur impairment charges 

table of contents long lived assets long lived assets  including property and equipment and purchased intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by the comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such an asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return 
it also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we have not determined the impact fin will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas no

in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
expands the use of fair value accounting but does not affect existing standards which require assets or liabilities to be carried at fair value 
under sfas no 
 a company may elect to use fair value to measure certain financial assets and liabilities 
the fair value election is irrevocable and generally made on an instrument by instrument basis  even if a company has similar instruments that it elects not to measure based on fair value 
at the adoption date  unrealized gains and losses on existing items for which fair value has been elected are reported as a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings 
subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
 changes in fair value are recognized in earnings

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain a marketable securities investment portfolio of various holdings  types and maturities 
in accordance with our investment guidelines  we only invest in instruments with high credit quality standards and we limit our exposure to any one issuer or type of investment 
we also hold shares of marvell common stock that were received in connection with the sale of our hard disk drive controller and tape drive controller business 
the shares of marvell common stock are equity securities and  as such  inherently have higher risk than the marketable securities in which we usually invest 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments 
as of april   the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value 
our investment portfolio consists primarily of marketable debt securities  including government securities  corporate bonds  municipal bonds  asset and mortgage backed securities  and other debt securities  which principally have remaining terms of three years or less 
consequently  such securities are not subject to significant interest rate risk 
all of our marketable securities are classified as available for sale
