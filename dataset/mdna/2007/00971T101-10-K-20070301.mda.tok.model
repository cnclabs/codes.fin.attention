item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we provide services for accelerating and improving the delivery of content and applications over the internet 
we primarily derive income from the sale of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer  which we refer to as recurring revenue contracts or long term contracts 
these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly level of usage with additional charges applicable for actual usage above the monthly minimum 
in recent years  however  we have entered into increasing numbers of customer contracts that have minimum usage commitments that are based on twelve month or longer periods 
our goal of having a consistent and predictable base level of income is important to our financial success 
accordingly  to be successful  we must maintain our base of recurring revenue contracts by eliminating or reducing lost monthly or annual recurring revenue due to customer cancellations or terminations and build on that base by adding new customers and increasing the number of services  features and functions our existing customers purchase 
at the same time  we must ensure that our expenses do not increase faster than  or at the same rate as  our revenues 
accomplishing these goals requires that we compete effectively in the marketplace on the basis of price  quality and the attractiveness of our services and technology 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
see risk factors elsewhere in this annual report on form k for a discussion of certain risks associated with our business 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers  acquisitions  or divestitures of business combinations that may be announced after the date hereof 
recent events on december   we acquired all of the outstanding equity of nine systems in exchange for approximately million shares of akamai common stock and approximately million in cash  and we assumed options that had been issued by nine systems corporation that are exercisable for approximately  shares of akamai common stock 
the revenues and expenses generated from the acquisition date  december   to december  were not significant to our fiscal financial results reported in our consolidated statement of operations included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
on february   we announced that we had entered into an agreement and plan of merger to acquire netli 
under the terms of the agreement and plan of merger  upon consummation  we will acquire all of the outstanding equity of netli in exchange for approximately million shares of akamai s common stock  subject to certain closing adjustments 

table of contents our improved financial results in as compared to and reflect the success of our efforts to increase our monthly and annual recurring revenues while limiting the expenses needed to support such growth 
the following sets forth  as a percentage of revenues  consolidated statements of operations data for the years indicated revenues cost of revenues research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of other intangible assets total costs and operating expenses income from operations interest income interest expense other income expense  net gain loss on investments  net loss on early extinguishment of debt income before provision benefit for income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income we were profitable for fiscal years  and  however  we cannot guarantee continued profitability for any period in the future 
we have observed the following trends and events that are likely to have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations in the foreseeable future during each quarter in and  the dollar volume of new recurring revenue contracts exceeded the dollar volume of the contracts we lost through cancellations  terminations and non payment 
a continuation of this trend would lead to increased revenues in the future 
during  no customer accounted for or more of our total revenues 
we expect that customer concentration levels will continue to decline compared to prior years if our customer base continues to grow 
as of january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment revised  or sfas no 
r  which requires us to record compensation expense for employee stock awards at fair value at the time of grant 
as a result  our stock based compensation expense increased in as compared to  causing our net income to decrease significantly 
for the year ended december   our pre tax stock based compensation expense was million  as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we expect that stock based compensation expense will continue at the current rate  or slightly increase in the future  because we have a significant number of unvested employee awards outstanding and plan to continue to grant equity based compensation in the future 
as of december   our total pre tax unrecognized compensation costs for stock based awards were million  which we expect to recognize as expense over a weighted average period of years 
during  revenues derived from customers outside the united states accounted for of our total revenues 
we expect that revenues from customers outside the united states as a percentage of our total revenues will be between and in during  we continued to reduce our network bandwidth costs per unit by entering into new supplier contracts with lower pricing and amending existing contracts to take advantage of price reductions offered by our existing suppliers 
however  due to increased traffic delivered over our network  our total bandwidth 
table of contents costs increased during we believe that our overall bandwidth costs will continue to increase as a result of expected higher traffic levels  partially offset by continued reductions in bandwidth costs per unit that we have realized and may continue to realize in the future 
if we do not experience lower per unit bandwidth pricing and we are unsuccessful at effectively routing traffic over our network through lower cost providers  network bandwidth costs could increase in excess of our expectations in depreciation expense related to our network equipment increased in as compared to as we have increased our purchases of servers during the year in an effort to expand our network and improve the quality of our services 
we expect this trend to continue in  accordingly  we believe that depreciation expense related to our network equipment will continue to increase 
in addition  we expect to continue to enhance and add functionality to our service offerings and  therefore  to increase the amount of capitalized internal use software costs  which includes stock based compensation expense attributable to employees working on such projects 
as a result  we believe that the amortization of internal use software development costs  which we include in cost of revenues  will increase in during  our effective tax rate  including discrete items  was 
while we expect our annual effective tax rate to remain relatively constant in  we do not expect to make significant cash tax payments due to the continued utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards 
based on our analysis of these identified trends and events  we expect to continue to generate net income on a quarterly and annual basis during  however  our future results and our ability to generate profits will be affected by many factors identified below and in the section of this report entitled risk factors  including our ability to increase our revenue by adding customers through long term contracts and limiting customer cancellations and terminations  maintain the prices we charge for our services  prevent disruptions to our services and network due to accidents or intentional attacks  and maintain our network bandwidth costs and other operating expenses consistent with our revenues 
given these uncertainties  there is no assurance that we will achieve our expected financial objectives  including positive net income 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates overview our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
our estimates include those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable and related reserves  capitalized internal use software costs  intangible assets and goodwill  income and other taxes  impairment and useful lives of long lived assets  restructuring liabilities  loss contingencies and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
for a complete description of our significant accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
definitions we define our critical accounting policies as those accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america that require us to make subjective estimates about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles 
our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters that are 
table of contents highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and applied and require us to assess a range of potential outcomes 
review of critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition we recognize service revenue in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the service is performed and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
at the inception of a customer contract for service  we make an estimate as to that customer s ability to pay for the services provided 
we base our estimate on a combination of factors  including the successful completion of a credit check or financial review  our payment history with the customer and other forms of payment assurance 
upon the completion of these steps  we recognize revenue monthly in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
if we subsequently determine that collection from the customer is not reasonably assured  we record an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense for all of that customer s unpaid invoices and cease recognizing revenue for continued services provided until cash is received 
changes in our estimates and judgments about whether collection is reasonably assured would change the timing of revenue or amount of bad debt expense that we recognize 
we primarily derive income from the sale of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer 
these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly or annual level of usage and provide the rate at which the customer must pay for actual usage above the monthly or annual minimum 
for these services  we recognize the monthly minimum as revenue each month provided that an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties  the service has been delivered to the customer  the fee for the service is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
should a customer s usage of our service exceed the monthly minimum  we recognize revenue for such excess usage in the period of the usage 
for annual revenue commitments  we recognize revenue monthly based upon the customer s usage in such period 
we typically charge the customer an installation fee when the services are first activated 
the installation fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated life of the customer arrangement 
we also derive income from services sold as discrete  non recurring events or based solely on usage 
for these services  we recognize revenue after an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties  the fee is fixed or determinable  the event or usage has occurred and collection is reasonably assured 
when more than one element is contained in a single arrangement  we allocate revenue between the elements based on each element s relative fair value  provided that each element meets the criteria as a separate unit of accounting 
an item is considered a separate unit of accounting if it has value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and verifiable evidence of the fair value of the separate elements 
fair value is generally determined based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately 
if the fair value of each element cannot be objectively determined  the total value of the arrangement is recognized ratably over the entire service period to the extent that all services have begun to be provided at the outset of the period 
for most multi element service arrangements to date  the fair value of each element has not been objectively determinable 
therefore  all revenue under these arrangements has been recognized ratably over the related service period to the extent that all services have begun to be provided at the outset of the period 
we also license software under perpetual and term license agreements 
we apply the provisions of statement of position  or sop   software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modifications of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
as prescribed by this guidance  we apply the residual method of accounting 
the residual method requires that the portion of the total arrangement fee attributable to undelivered elements  as indicated by vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  is deferred and subsequently recognized when delivered 
the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements  if all other revenue recognition criteria of sop are met 

table of contents we also sell our services through a reseller channel 
assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  we recognize revenue from reseller arrangements based on the reseller s contracted non refundable minimum purchase commitments over the term of the contract  plus amounts sold by the reseller to its customers in excess of the minimum commitments 
these excess commitments are recognized as revenue in the period in which the service is provided 
we recognize revenue from fixed fee arrangements and software arrangements that require significant customization or modification using the percentage of completion method in accordance with accounting research bulletin  or arb  no 
 long term construction type contracts  and with the applicable guidance provided by sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we generally recognize revenue under these arrangements based on the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to the estimated total cost to complete the project 
in certain customer arrangements  we recognize revenue based on the progress made towards achieving milestones under the contract 
the impact of any change in estimate is recorded prospectively from the date of the change 
at the outset of a fixed fee arrangement  if we are not able to estimate the total cost to complete  nor able to measure progress towards the achievement of contract milestones  we account for the arrangement using the completed contract method of accounting 
under this method  we recognize revenue when the contract is complete and there are no remaining costs or deliverables 
in the event that the estimated total cost on a fixed fee contract indicates a loss  we will record the loss immediately 
from time to time  we enter into contracts to sell our services or license our technology to unrelated companies at or about the same time we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same companies 
if we conclude that these contracts were negotiated concurrently  we record as revenue only the net cash received from the vendor  unless the product or service received has a separate and identifiable benefit and the fair value to us of the vendor s product or service can be objectively established 
we may from time to time resell licenses or services of third parties 
we record revenue for these transactions on a gross basis when we have risk of loss related to the amounts purchased from the third party and we add value to the license or service  such as by providing maintenance or support for such license or service 
if these conditions are present  we recognize revenue when all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
deferred revenue includes amounts billed to customers for which revenue has not been recognized 
deferred revenue primarily consists of the unearned portion of monthly billed service fees  prepayments made by customers for future periods  deferred installation and activation set up fees  amounts billed under extended payment terms  and maintenance and support fees charged under license arrangements 
accounts receivable and related reserves trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest 
in addition to trade accounts receivable  our accounts receivable balance includes unbilled accounts that represent revenue recorded for customers that is typically billed within one month 
we record reserves against our accounts receivable balance 
these reserves consist of allowances for doubtful accounts  cash basis customers and service credits 
increases and decreases in the allowance for doubtful accounts are included as a component of general and administrative expenses 
the reserve for cash basis customers increases as services are provided to customers for which collection is no longer assured 
the reserve decreases and revenue is recognized when and if cash payments are received 
the reserve for service credits increases as a result of specific service credits that are expected to be issued to customers during the ordinary course of business  as well as for billing disputes 
these credits result in a reduction to revenues 
decreases to the reserve for service credits are the result of actual credits being issued to customers  causing a corresponding reduction in accounts receivable 
estimates are used in determining these reserves and are based upon our review of outstanding balances on a customer specific  account by account basis 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon a review of customer receivables from prior sales with collection issues where we no longer believe that the customer has the ability to pay for prior services provided 
we reserve for all invoices that have been outstanding greater than one year 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers 
if such an evaluation indicates that payment is no longer reasonably assured for services provided  any future services provided to that customer will result in creation of a cash basis reserve until we receive consistent payments 
in addition  we reserve a portion of revenues as a 
table of contents reserve for service credits 
reserves for service credits are measured based on an analysis of revenue credits to be issued after the month of billing and an estimate for future credits 
these credits typically relate to management s estimate of the resolution of customer disputes and billing adjustments 
we do not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers 
impairment and useful lives of long lived assets we review our long lived assets  such as fixed assets and intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset 
when such events occur  we compare the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset 
if this comparison indicates that an impairment is present  the amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
if a readily determinable market price does not exist  fair value is estimated using discounted expected cash flows attributable to the asset 
the estimates required to apply this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the long lived assets and the useful lives of these assets and expected future cash flows 
changes in these estimates could materially impact results from operations 
goodwill and other intangible assets we test goodwill for impairments on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
we performed an impairment test of goodwill as of january  and january  these tests did not result in an impairment of goodwill 
other intangible assets consist of completed technologies  customer relationships  trademarks and non compete agreements arising from acquisitions of businesses and acquired license rights 
purchased intangible assets  other than goodwill  are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the economic value derived from the related intangible assets 
goodwill is carried at its historical cost 
restructuring liabilities related to facility leases when we vacate a facility subject to a non cancelable long term lease  we record a restructuring liability for either the estimated costs to terminate the lease or the estimated costs that will continue to be incurred under the lease for its remaining term where there is no economic benefit to us 
in the latter case  we measure the amount of the restructuring liability as the amount of contractual future lease payments reduced by an estimate of sublease income 
to date  we have recorded a restructuring liability when our management approves and commits us to a plan to terminate a lease  the plan specifically identifies the actions to be taken  and the actions are scheduled to begin soon after management approves the plan 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  we record restructuring liabilities  discounted at the appropriate rate  for a facility lease only when we have both vacated the space and completed all actions needed to make the space readily available for sublease 
as of december   we had approximately  in accrued restructuring liabilities related to vacated facilities  which we expect will be paid within months 
loss contingencies we define a loss contingency as a condition involving uncertainty as to a possible loss related to a previous event that will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
our primary loss contingencies relate to pending or threatened litigation 
we record a liability for a loss contingency when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
when we believe the likelihood of a loss is less than probable and more than remote  we do not record a liability 
material loss contingencies are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
tax reserves our provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion 
the current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year 
the deferred 
table of contents income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse 
we currently have significant deferred tax assets resulting from net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences 
our management periodically weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
during  our management determined it was more likely than not that substantially all of the deferred tax assets would be realized  and  accordingly released substantially all of our valuation allowance 
this decision was based on our cumulative history of earnings before taxes for financial reporting purposes over a quarter period and on the projections of expected future taxable income 
the tax assets estimated to be realized in future periods have been calculated by applying a blended federal and state tax rate of  which is based upon the tax rates expected to be in effect  apportioned by jurisdiction  in the periods during which the attributes are expected to be utilized 
changes in this blended rate in future periods could have a material effect on both the tax provision in the period of change as well as the net deferred tax asset carrying value 
we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our sales and use and franchise tax positions 
these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes  rules  regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions 
our estimate of the value of these tax reserves contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes  rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions 
it is possible that the costs of the ultimate tax liability or benefit from these matters may be materially greater or less than the amount that we estimated 
in november  the fasb issued fasb staff position sfas no 
r  transition election to accounting for the tax effect of share based payment awards 
we have elected to adopt the modified prospective transition method for calculating the tax effects of stock based compensation pursuant to sfas no 
r 
under the modified prospective transition method  no adjustment is made to the deferred tax balances associated with stock based payments that continue to be classified as equity awards 
additionally  we elected to use the long form method  as provided in paragraph of sfas no 
r to determine the pool of windfall tax benefits 
the long form method requires us to analyze the book and tax compensation for each award separately as if it had been issued following the recognition provisions of sfas no 
 subject to adjustments for net operating loss carryforwards 
accounting for stock based compensation since january   we have accounted for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r 
historically  we recognized stock based compensation costs pursuant to accounting principles bulletin no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and elected to disclose the impact of expensing stock options pursuant to sfas no 
 share based payment in the notes to our financial statements 
see note to the financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
we have selected the black scholes option pricing model to determine fair value of stock option awards 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected life of the stock awards and the volatility of the underlying common stock 
our assumptions may differ from those used in prior periods because of adjustments to the calculation of such assumptions based upon the guidance of sfas no 
r and staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment 
changes to the assumptions may have a significant impact on the fair value of stock options  which could have a material impact on our financial statements 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
should our actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from our estimates  our stock based compensation expense and results of operations could be materially impacted 
capitalized internal use software costs we capitalize the salaries and payroll related costs of employees and consultants who devote time to the development of internal use software projects 
if a project constitutes an enhancement to previously developed software  we assess whether the enhancement is significant and creates additional functionality to the software  thus 
table of contents qualifying the work incurred for capitalization 
once the project is complete  we estimate the useful life of the internal use software  and we periodically assess whether the software is impaired 
changes in our estimates related to internal use software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded during the period 
results of operations revenues 
total revenues increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  total revenues increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in total revenues for as compared to was attributable to an increase in service revenue of million 
service revenue  which consists of revenue from our content and application delivery services  increased  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  service revenue was million for the year ended december  the increases in service revenue during the periods presented were primarily attributable to increases in the number of customers under recurring revenue contracts  as well as increases in traffic and additional services sold to new and existing customers and increases in the average revenue per customer 
the increases in service revenue and are attributable to greater market acceptance of our services among new customers and improvements in our ability to sell additional features to our existing customers 
our delivery of streaming services for a number of high profile media events during also contributed to higher service revenue 
also contributing to the increases in service revenue for the year ended december  were revenues generated from customers of speedera  which we acquired in june as of december   we had  customers under recurring revenue contracts as compared to  as of december   and  as of december  software and software related revenue decreased  or  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  software and software related revenue was million for the year ended december  software and software related revenue includes sales of customized software projects and technology licensing 
the decreases in software and software related revenue over the periods presented reflect a reduction in the number of customized software projects that we undertook for customers and a decrease in the number of software licenses executed with customers 
we do not expect software and software related revenue to increase as a percentage of revenues in for and  and  respectively  of our total revenues was derived from our operations located outside of the united states  of which and of total revenues  respectively  was derived from operations in europe 
for  of our total revenues was derived from our operations located outside of the united states  of which of total revenues was derived from operations in europe 
no single country accounted for or more of revenues derived outside of the united states during these periods 
we do not expect international sales to increase as a percentage of our overall sales in resellers accounted for of revenues in  in and in for and  no single customer accounted for or more of total revenues

cost of revenues 
cost of revenues includes fees paid to network providers for bandwidth and co location of our network equipment 
cost of revenues also includes payroll and related costs and stock based compensation for network operations personnel  cost of software licenses  depreciation of network equipment used to deliver our services  amortization of internal use software and amortization of capitalized stock based compensation 
cost of revenues increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  cost of revenues increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  these increases were primarily due to an increase in the amounts paid to network providers due to higher traffic levels  partially offset by reduced bandwidth costs per unit  and an increase in depreciation expense of network equipment as we continue to invest in our infrastructure 
additionally  cost of revenues increased in due to an increase in stock based compensation expense resulting from our adoption of sfas no 
r 
cost of revenues during  and also included credits received of approximately million  million and million  respectively  from settlements and renegotiations entered into in connection with 
table of contents billing disputes related to bandwidth contracts 
credits of this nature may occur in the future  however  the timing and amount of future credits  if any  will vary 
cost of revenues is comprised of the following in millions for the year ended december  bandwidth  co location and storage fees payroll and related costs of network operations personnel stock based compensation cost of software licenses depreciation and impairment of network equipment and amortization of internal use software and stock based compensation total cost of revenues we have long term purchase commitments for bandwidth usage and co location with various networks and internet service providers 
for the years ending december   and  the minimum commitments related to bandwidth usage and co location services are approximately million  million and  respectively 
we believe cost of revenues will increase in we expect to deliver more traffic on our network  which would result in higher expenses associated with the increased traffic  however  such costs are likely to be partially offset by lower bandwidth costs per unit 
additionally  we anticipate increases in depreciation expense related to our network equipment and amortization of internal use software development costs  along with increased payroll and related costs  as we continue to make investments in our network to service our customer base 
cost of revenues is also expected to increase as we continue to expense employee stock awards at fair value in accordance with sfas no 
r 
the adoption of sfas no 
r will also result in additional expense associated with the amortization of stock based compensation 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs and stock based compensation for research and development personnel who design  develop  test and enhance our services and our network 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred  except certain internal use software development costs eligible for capitalization 
during the years ended december   and  we capitalized software development costs of million  million and million  respectively  net of impairments 
these development costs consisted of external consulting and payroll and payroll related costs for personnel involved in the development of internal use software used to deliver our services and operate our network 
additionally  for the year ended december   we capitalized million of stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r 
these capitalized internal use software costs are amortized to cost of revenues over their estimated useful lives of two years 
research and development expenses increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  research and development expenses increased  or million  to for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million 
research and development expense increased in due to an increase in stock based compensation expense resulting from sfas no

the increase in general and administrative expenses during was primarily due to an increase in payroll and related costs as a result of headcount growth  as well as stock based compensation expense 
these increases were offset by a reduction in legal and consulting costs associated with the dismissal of the lawsuits between akamai and speedera as a result of our acquisition of speedera and a reduction in non income taxes as a result of settlements with state taxation authorities in that allowed us to reduce the related accrual 
these one time savings resulted in higher non income taxes in as compared to the prior year

interest expense includes interest paid on our debt obligations as well as amortization of deferred financing costs 
interest expense decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  interest expense decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease during each of these periods was due to lower interest expense as a result of redemptions and repurchases of our convertible subordinated notes 
during and  we redeemed or repurchased million and million  respectively  in aggregate principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes 
as of december   there was an aggregate principal amount of million of our convertible senior notes outstanding 
we believe that interest expense on our debt obligations  including deferred financing amortization  will not exceed million in other income expense  net 
other income expense  net primarily represents net foreign exchange gains and losses incurred during the periods presented  as well as gains and losses on legal settlements 
other net expense decreased  or million  to other net income of  for the year ended december  as compared to other net expense of  for the year ended december  other net income was million for the year ended december  other net income for the year ended december  represented  of foreign exchange gains and  of net gains on legal settlements 
other net expense of  for the year ended december  represented approximately million of foreign exchange losses  offset by million of net gains on legal settlements 
for the year ended december   other net income of million represented approximately  of gains on legal settlements and  of foreign exchange gains 
other net income expense may fluctuate in the future based upon movements in foreign exchange rates  the outcome of legal proceedings and other events 
gain loss on investments  net 
during the year ended december   we recorded a net gain on investments of  on the sale of marketable securities 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded a net loss on investments of  and  respectively  from the sale of marketable securities 
we do not expect significant gains or losses on investments in loss on early extinguishment of debt 
we had no loss on early extinguishment of debt during because we did not redeem or repurchase any debt during the year 
loss on early extinguishment of debt decreased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in loss on early extinguishment of debt in is due to costs incurred in connection with our redemption of million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes during this loss of million consists of  in premiums above par value paid to redeem such notes and  of deferred financing costs associated with redeeming such notes prior to their maturity 
during  we repurchased million in principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes which resulted in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million 
provision benefit for income taxes 
provision for income taxes increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to a benefit for income taxes of million during the year ended december  provision for income taxes was  for the year ended december  during  in connection with the release of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance  we recorded an income tax benefit of million which was offset by provision for income taxes primarily related to our alternative minimum tax 
table of contents obligations and income earned in profitable foreign jurisdictions 
as a result of the release of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million in the provision for income taxes for was primarily related to our alternative minimum tax payment obligations and income earned in foreign jurisdictions where we were profitable 
as of december   our united states and foreign net operating losses  or nols  and other deferred tax assets were fully offset by a valuation allowance primarily because at the time  pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we did not have sufficient history of taxable income to conclude that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize the tax benefits of those deferred tax assets 
based upon our cumulative history of earnings over a quarter period and an assessment of our expected future results of operations  during the third quarter of  we determined that it had become more likely than not that we would be able to realize a substantial portion of our united states and foreign nol carryforward tax assets prior to their expiration and other deferred tax assets 
as a result  during  we released a total of million of our united states and foreign deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
of the million  million of the valuation release was recorded as an income tax benefit in our statement of operations  million of the valuation release was attributable to stock option exercises  which was recorded as an increase in additional paid in capital on our balance sheet  and approximately million of the valuation release was recorded as a reduction to acquired goodwill and intangible assets 
as of december   we had a remaining valuation allowance of million 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded additional deferred tax assets related to acquired nol carryforwards from nine systems 
however  these nols are subject to limitation pursuant to section of the internal revenue code due to changes in ownership of more than 
because the realization of these deferred tax assets does not meet the more likely than not criterion under sfas no 
 we recorded a valuation allowance of million against the acquired nols 
we continue to maintain a valuation allowance of million related to certain state nols that we expect will expire unused 
while we expect our consolidated annualized effective tax rate in to remain relatively consistent with  this expectation does not take into consideration the effect of discrete items recorded as a result of our compliance with sfas no 
r 
the effective tax rate including the effect of discrete items could be materially different depending on the nature and timing of the disposition of incentive and other employee stock options 
because of the availability of the nols discussed above  a significant portion of our future provision for income taxes is expected to be a non cash expense  consequently  the amount of cash paid with respect to income taxes is expected to be a relatively small portion of the total annualized tax expense during periods in which the nols are utilized 
in determining our net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances  and projections of our future provision for income taxes  annualized effective tax rates  and cash paid for income taxes  management is required to make judgments and estimates about domestic and foreign profitability  the timing and extent of the utilization of nol carryforwards  applicable tax rates  transfer pricing methodologies and tax planning strategies 
judgments and estimates related to our projections and assumptions are inherently uncertain  therefore  actual results could differ materially from our projections 
we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our sales and use and franchise tax positions 
these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes  rules  regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions 
our estimate of the value of these tax reserves reflects assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes  rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions 
it is possible that the ultimate tax liability or benefit from of these matters may be materially greater or less than the amount that we have estimated 
liquidity and capital resources to date  we have financed our operations primarily through the following transactions private sales of capital stock and subordinated notes  which notes were repaid in  an initial public offering of our common stock in october  which generated net proceeds of million  
table of contents the sale in june of an aggregate of million in principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes  which generated net proceeds of million and were repaid or redeemed in full between december and september  the sale in december and january of an aggregate of million in principal amount of our convertible senior notes  which generated net proceeds of million  the public offering of million shares of our common stock in november  which generated net proceeds of million  proceeds from the exercise of stock awards  and cash generated by operations

cash provided by operating activities increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  cash provided by operating activities increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by operating activities for each of and as compared to was primarily due to increased service revenue as well as increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
we expect that cash provided by operating activities will continue to increase as a result of an upward trend in cash collections related to higher revenues  partially offset by an expected increase in operating expenses that require cash outlays  such as salaries  in connection with expected increases in headcount 
the timing and amount of future working capital changes and our ability to manage our days sales outstanding will also affect the future amount of cash used in or provided by operating activities 
cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  cash used in investing activities for reflects net purchases of short and long term investments of million and capital expenditures of million  consisting of the capitalization of internal use development costs related to our current and future service offerings and purchases of network infrastructure equipment 
in addition  approximately million of cash  including transaction costs  was used to acquire nine systems 
these investments were offset by a decrease of  in restricted investments previously held for security deposits 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  reflects net purchases of marketable securities of million primarily related to the cash received from our equity financing in november additionally  cash used in investing activities for includes capital expenditures of million 
these investments were offset by million of cash acquired through the speedera acquisition and a decrease of  in restricted investments previously held for security deposits 
cash provided by investing activities for reflects proceeds from net sales and maturities of investments of million  offset by capital expenditures of million 
during  cash provided by investing activities also included a decrease of million in restricted cash to reflect our repurchase of million in principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes in early and a decrease of  in restricted investments previously held for security deposits 
for  we expect total capital expenditures  a component of cash used in investing activities  to be approximately the same percentage of revenues as cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  included proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options and the sale of shares under our employee stock purchase plan 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  also includes million related to excess tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options

changes in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities are dependent upon changes in working capital items such as deferred revenue  accounts payable  accounts receivable and various accrued expenses  as well as changes in our capital and financial structure  including debt repurchases and issuances  stock option exercises  sales of equity investments and similar events 
the following table represents the net inflows and outflows of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities for the periods presented in millions for the year ended december  cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balance as of december   and  respectively changes in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities receipts from customers payments to vendors payments for employee payroll debt repurchases debt proceeds debt interest and premium payments stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan issuances equity offering proceeds cash used in acquired through business acquisitions interest income other net increase cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balance as of december   and  respectively we believe  based on our current business plan  that our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million as of december  and forecasted cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures and restructuring expenses for at least the next months 
if the assumptions underlying our business plan regarding future revenue and expenses change or if unexpected opportunities or needs arise  we may seek to raise additional cash by selling equity or debt securities 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or debt securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those accruing to holders of common stock  and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would also result in additional dilution to our stockholders

the letters of credit are collateralized by restricted marketable securities  of which million are classified as long term marketable securities and million are classified as short term marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheet dated as of december  the restrictions on these marketable securities lapse as we fulfill our obligations or as such obligations expire under the terms of the letters of credit 
these restrictions are expected to lapse at various times through may off balance sheet arrangements we have entered into various indemnification arrangements with third parties  including vendors  customers  landlords  our officers and directors  stockholders of acquired companies  joint venture partners and third parties to whom and from whom we license technology 
generally  these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by third parties due to various events  such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement or our negligence 
these indemnification obligations are considered off balance sheet arrangements in accordance with fasb interpretation  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
to date  we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in our financial statements 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for further discussion of these indemnification agreements 
the conversion features of our convertible senior notes are equity linked derivatives 
as such  we recognize these instruments as off balance sheet arrangements 
the conversion features associated with these notes would be accounted for as derivative instruments  except that they are indexed to our common stock and classified in stockholders equity

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin no 
fin no 
clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin no 
prescribes a two step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized 
first  the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination 
if the tax position is deemed more likely than not to be sustained  the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
fin no 
will be effective for us beginning in we do not expect the implementation of fin no 
to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in september  the securities and exchange commission  or the sec  released staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab sab expresses the sec staff s views regarding the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements 
sab also states that correcting prior year financial statements for immaterial errors would not require previously filed reports to be amended 
such correction may be made the next time the registrant files the prior year financial statements 
registrants electing not to restate prior periods should reflect the effects of initially applying the guidance in sab in their annual financial statements covering the first fiscal year ending after november  the cumulative effect of the initial application should be reported in the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of that fiscal year and the offsetting adjustment should be made to the opening balance of retained earnings for that year 
registrants should disclose the nature and amount of each individual error being corrected in the cumulative adjustment 
the disclosure should also include when and how each error arose and the fact that the errors had previously been considered immaterial 
the sec staff encourages early application of the guidance in sab for interim periods of the first fiscal year ending after november  the implementation of sab did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements but may change current practice for some entities 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those years 
we do not expect the implementation of sab to have a material impact on our financial statements
