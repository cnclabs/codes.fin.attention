item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and applicable notes to the financial statements and supplementary data  item  and other information in this report  including risk factors set forth in item a and critical accounting policies and cautionary information at the end of this item the railroad  along with its subsidiaries and rail affiliates  is our one reportable operating segment 
although revenue is analyzed by commodity group  we analyze the net financial results of the railroad as one segment due to the integrated nature of our rail network 
executive summary results safety overall  safety results improved during the employee injury incident rate per  man hours dropped to its lowest level  which also reduced the number of lost workdays 
a continued focus on derailment prevention in resulted in a reduction in incidents with associated costs declining 
in the area of public safety  we closed grade crossings to reduce exposure and have video cameras in approximately  or  of our road locomotive fleet to better analyze grade crossing incidents  thereby increasing safety for our employees and the public 
the number of grade crossing incidents  however  increased during the year  driven in part by the combination of increasing highway and rail traffic and urban expansion 
financial performance in  we generated record operating income of billion 
solid demand  yield increases  and improved operational efficiency drove the increase in operating income 
our operating ratio was for the year  a point improvement compared to net income of billion also topped our previous milestone  translating into diluted earnings per share 
commodity revenue growth our commodity revenue grew year over year to billion  the highest level in our history 
we achieved record revenue levels in all of our six commodity groups  primarily driven by better pricing and fuel surcharges 
since  we repriced approximately two thirds of our business 
volume increased to record levels in  despite softening markets in some sectors in the second half of network improvement in  the fluidity and efficiency of our transportation network improved substantially  which allowed us to handle record volume levels 
continued focus on increasing velocity  eliminating work events  improving asset utilization  and expanding capacity were key drivers of our operational improvement 
with ongoing enhancements to our unified plan and implementation of terminal processing initiatives  productivity improved  as demonstrated by lower average terminal dwell time  a improvement in car utilization  and a increase in average train speed 
we continued implementation of an operational productivity initiative called cims customer inventory management system  which complements the unified plan by reducing the number of cars in our terminals without adding capacity 
by the end of  cims managed the flow of almost of the daily interchange of both loaded and empty railcars with our customers 
we also expanded capacity and continued to use industrial engineering techniques to further improve network fluidity  ease capacity constraints  and improve asset utilization 
our customers rated us higher on their satisfaction surveys during  an indication that efforts to improve network operations translated into better customer service 
fuel prices fuel prices increased again in for the fourth consecutive year  raising our average system fuel price by and adding million of operating expenses compared to after a fairly stable first quarter  fuel prices increased dramatically during the spring and summer months  as crude oil prices averaged over per barrel during the second and third quarters 
july and august fuel prices were also affected by high diesel conversion spreads and large  regional spreads mainly driven by new government 
table of contents regulations that imposed certain usage restrictions on high sulfur diesel fuel 
many refineries ceased producing high sulfur diesel fuel and many pipelines stopped transporting high sulfur diesel fuel in our operating areas  which drove up the conversion and regional spreads 
despite some moderation during the fourth quarter  fuel prices were still higher than the beginning of the year 
our fuel surcharge programs helped offset the impact of these higher fuel prices in the form of higher revenue  recovering approximately of the additional expense incurred above our base fuel price of per gallon for the year 
in addition  our fuel conservation efforts allowed us to handle a increase in gross ton miles while improving our consumption rate by 
simulator training  operating practices  and technology are all driving this improvement  saving us roughly million gallons in free cash flow cash generated by operating activities totaled a record billion  yielding free cash flow of million in free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities  less cash used in investing activities and dividends paid 
free cash flow is not considered a financial measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap by sec regulation g and item of sec regulation s k 
we believe free cash flow is important in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash without additional external financings 
free cash flow should be considered in addition to  rather than as a substitute for  cash provided by operating activities 
the following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities gaap measure to free cash flow non gaap measure millions of dollars cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities dividends paid free cash flow outlook safety operating a safe railroad benefits our employees  our customers  our shareholders  and the public 
we will continue using a multi faceted approach to safety  using technology  risk assessment  quality control  and training and education for our new and existing employees 
from a public safety standpoint  we will continue our efforts to upgrade and close crossings  install video cameras on locomotives  and educate the public about crossing safety through various internal and industry programs  along with other activities 
additionally  we are working with private and public partners to develop better tank cars for transportation of chemicals 
commodity revenue growth we expect record revenue levels to continue in based on current economic indicators  forecasted demand  and additional repricing opportunities 
we established a target for year over year commodity revenue growth of to 
we are projecting yield increases in all of our major commodity groups and volume growth ranging from to 
we expect volume growth primarily from the energy and intermodal commodity groups 
we will continue to monitor the market for changing conditions and adjust our plan accordingly 
transportation plan in  we will continue to evaluate traffic flows and network logistic patterns to identify additional opportunities to simplify operations and improve network efficiency 
we plan to maintain adequate manpower and locomotives  improve productivity using industrial engineering techniques  and improve our operating margins 
fuel prices we expect that fuel prices will remain volatile  with crude oil prices and conversion and regional spreads fluctuating throughout the year 
to reduce the impact of fuel price on earnings  we will continue to seek recovery from our customers through our fuel surcharge programs and expand our fuel conservation efforts 
as indicated in item of this report  the stb issued a decision limiting the manner in 
table of contents which us railroads can calculate fuel surcharges on traffic regulated by the stb 
currently  we do not believe this decision will prevent us from using fuel surcharges or adversely affect our ability to use fuel surcharges to mitigate the impact of rising or elevated fuel prices on most or all of our traffic 
capital plan in  we expect to make capital investments of approximately billion  which may include long term leases 
these investments will be used to maintain track and structures  continue capacity expansions on our main lines in constrained corridors  remove bottlenecks  upgrade and augment equipment  including locomotives and railcars  to better meet customer needs  build and improve facilities and terminals  and develop and implement new technologies 
we designed these investments to maintain infrastructure for safety  enhance customer service  promote growth  and improve operational fluidity 
major capital projects in include adding more double track on the sunset corridor and related line capacity  investing in new and existing facilities and terminals in phoenix  tucson  the la basin  san antonio  dallas fort worth  and houston  continuing improvements of the sprb joint line  and continuing installation of centralized track control across iowa and nebraska  which enables us to increase productivity on these rail lines 
we expect to fund our cash capital investments through cash generated from operations  the sale or lease of various operating and non operating properties  and cash on hand at december  this focused capital plan is designed to help us improve network velocity and facilitate revenue growth 
financial expectations we are somewhat cautious about the economic environment  however  we anticipate revenue growth and continued network improvement in  with financial results exceeding levels 
our expectations include generating earnings growth of to and an operating ratio below 
results of operations operating revenue millions of dollars change v change v commodity revenue other revenue total operating revenue includes commodity revenue and other revenue 
other revenue consists primarily of revenue earned by our subsidiaries  revenue from our commuter rail operations  and accessorial revenue  which we earn when customers retain equipment owned or controlled by us 
we recognize commodity revenue on a percentage of completion basis as freight moves from origin to destination 
we allocate commodity revenue between reporting periods based on the relative transit time in each reporting period and recognize expenses as we incur them 
we recognize other revenue as service is performed or contractual obligations are met 
customer incentives  which are primarily provided for shipping a specified cumulative volume or shipping to from specific locations  are recorded as a reduction to revenue based on actual or projected future customer shipments 
all six commodity groups experienced double digit revenue growth during  with particularly strong growth of over in agricultural commodity revenue 
price increases  fuel surcharges  and index based contract escalators  which are formulas in our shipping contracts that correlate price adjustments to certain economic indices  all contributed to higher average revenue per car arc 
our fuel surcharge programs excluding index based contract escalators that contain some provision for fuel generated an additional million in commodity revenue compared to  contributing to commodity revenue growth 
volume increased during the year led by solid growth in intermodal and energy shipments  which was partially offset by lower shipments of industrial products and chemicals 
the year over year growth was also partially attributable to lower volume in due to the january west coast storm  sprb joint line disruptions  hurricane rita  and the kansas washouts 

table of contents commodity revenue improved in all six business groups during  with double digit growth in the agricultural  industrial products  and intermodal commodity groups 
fuel surcharges  price increases  and index based contract escalators all contributed to higher arc 
our fuel surcharge programs excluding index based contract escalators that contain some provision for fuel generated an additional million in commodity revenue compared to  which represents approximately of the additional expense incurred above the base fuel price for our fuel surcharge programs currently  per gallon 
although volume grew for the year  the severe weather and maintenance and restoration on the sprb joint line constrained volume growth 
other revenue increased in  mainly driven by higher volumes 
in addition  we generated higher subsidiary revenue from bay pacific financial llc bay pacific  an intermodal leasing entity  following the acquisition of our joint venture partner s interest in bay pacific during the third quarter of subsidiary and accessorial revenue increased other revenue in  mainly driven by higher volumes and the acquisition of bay pacific

table of contents agricultural price increases  volume growth  and fuel surcharges increased agricultural commodity revenue in versus whole grains increased as strong gulf exports and higher freight charges for barge traffic shifted feed grain shipments to rails 
shipments of ethanol  a grain product used as an alternative fuel and fuel additive  and its co products primarily livestock feed also experienced strong growth  reflecting continued demand in this growing industry 
conversely  wheat shipments declined due to extremely low crop production levels in primarily due to drought conditions in wheat producing states 
price and fuel surcharge increases improved arc in price increases and fuel surcharges increased agricultural commodity revenue in compared to total carloads were flat compared to carloads of grain products increased during as we shipped more dry feed ingredients to mexico and more ethanol 
higher demand for ethanol reflected the impact of energy demand  crude oil prices  and limited capacity of domestic refineries 
reduced carloadings of sugar beets partially offset the gains 
declining carloads of feed grain and reduced shipments of wheat both contributed to lower whole grain shipments 
arc improvement in resulted from price increases  fuel surcharges  and the positive impact of a larger percentage of carloads with longer average lengths of haul 
logo logo automotive price increases  volume growth  and fuel surcharges increased automotive commodity revenue in over shipments of finished vehicles grew as higher manufacturer inventories at the end of translated into record volume growth for transportation in shipments remained relatively strong through the second quarter due to the production ramp up of new models at plants served by us 
automotive parts shipments also grew due to conversion of traffic from trucks  new business growth  and production increases at several uprr served assembly plants 
fuel surcharges and price increases drove the arc improvement 
revenue increased in over primarily due to fuel surcharges and price increases  which also drove arc improvement 
carloads decreased due to lower shipments of domestically manufactured finished vehicles and automotive parts and materials  reflecting industry weakness during 
table of contents chemicals price increases  fuel surcharges  and index based contract escalators drove the increase in revenue and arc in versus fewer fertilizer shipments largely drove the volume decrease 
wet weather conditions in the midwest led to weak demand during the fall fertilizer season 
in addition  softer export markets for potash  a fertilizer product  also led to reduced volumes 
business interruptions in the third quarter of  primarily attributable to hurricane rita  reduced chemicals shipments leading to favorable volume comparisons in price increases  fuel surcharges  and higher shipments of potash from canada to portland via the eastport  idaho gateway for overseas export all drove revenue growth in versus declines in liquid and dry chemicals  plastics  and petroleum shipments  in part due to the business interruptions caused by hurricane rita  reduced volume 
in addition  liquid and dry chemical shipments and plastic shipments were lower due to a weak export market  plant closures for maintenance  and the impact of an agreement with the bnsf for access to certain facilities in the bayport  texas area 
arc improved in due to price increases and fuel surcharges 
logo logo energy price increases  fuel surcharges  and index based contract escalators primarily drove the increases in revenue and arc in over volume increases also contributed to revenue growth as coal shipments from the sprb mines improved during the year 
these increases in partially reflect lower volume levels in  as sprb joint line disruptions  network disruptions resulting from hurricane rita  and the october kansas washouts hampered coal shipments in conversely  shipments from the colorado and utah mines declined in due to mine shutdowns during the first quarter of  along with the impact of mining production problems and network maintenance throughout the third quarter of revenue growth in over reflects higher prices  fuel surcharges  and index based contract escalators 
although volume grew in the first quarter  carloads for were flat as a result of the extensive maintenance and restoration work on the sprb joint line during the second  third  and fourth quarters  the impact of hurricane rita  the kansas washouts  and temporary outages at mines in colorado and utah during the fourth quarter of arc was higher due to price increases  higher fuel surcharges  and index based contract escalators 

table of contents industrial products price increases and fuel surcharges improved revenue and arc in over volume levels declined due to lower lumber  paper  and newsprint shipments  which were partially offset by higher steel shipments 
the softening of the housing market  lower production levels  and general market uncertainty drove the reduction in lumber shipments 
conversely  strong domestic markets throughout most of the year drove the increase in construction related steel material and pipe  particularly those materials used in oil and gas drilling 
hurricane rita reduced shipment volumes of industrial products in  which favorably affected volume comparisons with price increases and fuel surcharges generated revenue growth in versus in particular  lumber shipments contributed to this growth due to solid pricing gains and fuel surcharges 
revenue from stone shipments increased revenue from construction products due to strong construction demand  larger train sizes  and improved car cycle times 
car cycle time is defined as the amount of time that a car spends on our system measured from the origin of the loaded or empty move until arrival at final destination 
overall carloads were flat compared to partially offsetting substantial volume growth of stone shipments were reduced paper moves  primarily newsprint and fiber  and fewer shipments of government materials  steel  and cement  resulting from softening markets  cement shortages in certain markets  and higher inventories 
price increases and fuel surcharges drove arc increases 
logo logo intermodal record volume growth  fuel surcharges  price increases  and index based contract escalators combined to improve revenue in over in addition to the favorable impact from weaker intermodal revenue during due to the january west coast storm 
carloadings grew due to strong imports  primarily from asia  partially offset by decreased domestic traffic 
arc improved due to price increases  fuel surcharges  and contract escalators 
revenue in improved over due to strong imports  primarily from china and the rest of asia 
however  business interruptions during the first quarter of due to the january west coast storm limited full year revenue growth 
arc improved due to price increases  fuel surcharges  and contract escalators 
mexico business each commodity group discussed above includes revenue from shipments to and from mexico 
revenue from mexico business increased to billion in compared to price increases  fuel surcharges  and shipments of finished vehicles  automotive parts  import beer  dry feed ingredients  and 
table of contents intermodal drove revenue growth in volume declines in coal  newsprint  and sulfur shipments partially offset the increases 
in  revenue from mexico grew to billion  resulting primarily from price increases and fuel surcharges 
carloads were flat versus  as fewer automotive parts  energy  and intermodal shipments offset higher agricultural and industrial shipments 
operating expenses millions of dollars change v change v salaries  wages  and employee benefits fuel and utilities equipment and other rents depreciation materials and supplies casualty costs purchased services and other costs total operating expenses increased million in higher fuel prices  which rose during the period  accounted for million of the increase 
our fuel surcharge programs helped offset these expenses in the form of higher revenue  recovering approximately of the additional expense incurred above our base fuel price of per gallon for the year 
we base a majority of our fuel surcharges on the average us diesel fuel price effective two months prior 
our recovery percentage improved from the first part of due to the timing impact of our surcharges 
surcharge revenue began to recover higher fuel costs earlier in the year  and the two month price lag caught up with declining fuel prices during the fourth quarter of conversely  fuel surcharge revenue during the first quarter of will decline as lower fourth quarter fuel prices will reduce most of our surcharges 
wages  benefits  and materials and supplies inflation  a larger workforce  volume related expenses  and higher locomotive and freight car maintenance and lease expenses accounted for most of the additional increase in settlement of all remaining insurance claims related to the january west coast storm  an improved fuel consumption rate  and improved car cycle times which reduced freight car rental expense partially offset the cost increases 
additional clean up and restoration costs for the january west coast storm favorably affects comparison of operating expenses with those in logo 
table of contents operating expenses increased million in versus excluding the asbestos charge of million pre tax in  operating expenses increased billion  or 
significantly higher locomotive fuel prices accounted for million of this increase our fuel surcharge programs helped offset these expenses in the form of higher revenue 
inflation in wages  benefits  materials  and services  as well as a larger workforce  resulted in most of the additional increase 
also driving higher operating expenses were increased contract services and clean up and restoration costs associated with the january west coast storm 
salaries  wages  and employee benefits general wage and benefit inflation increased expenses in  reflecting higher salaries and wages and the impact of higher healthcare costs and other benefit costs 
a larger workforce  driven by higher volume levels  and stock option expense required by new accounting rules also contributed to higher expenses 
conversely  reduced protection costs and operational improvements  boosted by network management initiatives and investment in capacity  partially offset these increases 
protection costs represent the differential payment when the wage earned for active employment is lower than an employee s protected rate of pay 
an individual s protected rate is imposed by the stb for employees adversely affected by a merger or is established by collective bargaining agreements with our labor unions in certain cases 
additionally  we incurred higher labor expenses in for clean up and restoration of property damaged by the january west coast storm 
several factors drove higher employment expenses in general wage and benefit inflation increased expenses  reflecting higher salaries and wages and the year over year impact of higher healthcare and other benefits costs 
we also incurred higher expenses for management bonuses in  as executive bonuses were not awarded for and bonuses for the professional workforce were significantly reduced in a increase in our workforce and higher demand during also contributed to the increases 
additionally  labor expenses  in the form of higher train crew costs and labor incurred for repair and clean up activities  increased due to the hurricanes in the third quarter and the west coast storm in the first quarter 
reduced severance and relocation costs  increased network efficiency  and reduced training expenses partially offset these increases 
transferring various support personnel to omaha  nebraska  resulted in higher severance and relocation costs in fuel and utilities millions of dollars change v change v locomotive fuel expense fuel surcharge revenue fuel and utilities include locomotive fuel  utilities other than telephone  and gasoline and other fuels 
higher diesel fuel prices  which averaged per gallon including taxes and transportation costs in compared to per gallon in  increased expenses by million 
a increase in gross ton miles resulted in million of additional expenses  which was partially offset by a improvement in our fuel consumption rate due to the use of newer  more fuel efficient locomotives and our fuel conservation programs 
as noted above and described in this item  we offset a significant portion of increased locomotive fuel expenses through revenue from fuel surcharges 
gasoline  utilities  and propane and other fuel expenses increased million in due to higher prices and increased usage 
in  diesel fuel prices averaged per gallon compared to per gallon in  increasing expenses by million 
a increase in gross ton miles resulted in million of additional expenses 
we offset million of these increases with a improvement in our consumption rate in versus the railroad had no fuel hedges in place during  whereas we hedged million gallons of fuel in gasoline  utilities  and propane expenses increased million in versus due to higher prices 
equipment and other rents equipment and other rents primarily includes rental expense the railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies  freight car  intermodal  and locomotive leases  other 
table of contents specialty equipment leases  and office and other rentals 
lease expense increased in compared to as we leased more locomotives and freight cars 
growth in automotive and intermodal shipments also increased our short term freight car rental expense 
improved car cycle times driven by network management initiatives partially offset this increase 
in  the number of leased locomotives and freight cars increased  resulting in higher lease expense 
carload volume growth also increased expenses 
improved car cycle times partially offset these increases which lowered our short term freight car rental expense 
depreciation the majority of depreciation relates to track structure  including rail  ties  and other track material 
a higher depreciable asset base  reflecting higher capital spending in recent years  and increased usage of our assets combined for higher depreciation expense in and materials and supplies materials used to maintain the railroad s lines  structures  and equipment are the principal components of materials and supplies expense 
this expense item also includes small tools  office supplies  other materials  and the costs of freight services to ship railroad supplies and materials 
we used more repair materials at higher component costs to repair and maintain freight cars and our fleet of locomotives in  including a growing number of units not covered by warranties 
in addition  we performed more maintenance on locomotives that were maintained internally and not subject to maintenance contracts with third party contractors compared to during  materials and supplies expense increased  primarily due to locomotive and freight car maintenance 
we used more repair materials to maintain a larger fleet of locomotives  including a growing number of units not covered by warranties 
additionally  we incurred higher costs for car wheel sets  traction motors  and lube oil 
conversely  we incurred lower freight charges for shipping railroad materials  and stationery and office supplies 
casualty costs personal injury costs  freight and property damage  insurance  and environmental expense are the primary components of casualty costs 
costs were flat in compared to as lower bad debt expenses  lower freight damage expenses  and lower expenses for destruction of foreign or leased equipment all offset personal injury costs and higher settlement expenses 
in  casualty costs were lower than the previous year primarily due to higher expenses incurred in for an asbestos charge  a costly derailment near san antonio  and a large jury verdict affirmed in for a crossing accident 
lower freight and property damage expense and lower costs for destruction of foreign or leased equipment also reduced casualty costs 
conversely  we incurred higher insurance costs and increased costs for third party personal injuries and damages related to environmental exposures 
purchased services and other costs purchased services and other costs include the costs of services purchased from outside contractors  state and local taxes  net costs of operating facilities jointly used by uprr and other railroads  transportation and lodging for train crew employees  trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers  leased automobile maintenance expenses  telephone and cellular expense  employee travel expense  and computer and other general expenses 
volume related expenses  including crew transportation and lodging costs  increased in driven by growth of carloads 
higher state and local taxes primarily sales and use taxes related to higher diesel fuel prices also increased expenses in compared to conversely  lower locomotive contract maintenance costs and lower expenses associated with jointly owned operating facilities reduced expenses in compared to settlement of all remaining insurance claims related to the january west coast storm and the gain from the sale of two airplanes also reduced expenses in finally  clean up and restoration costs related to the january west coast storm increased expenses in  which also contributed to lower year over year expenses in expenses increased in versus because we experienced higher volume related costs for freight car and locomotive contract maintenance and crew transportation and lodging 
although our intermodal carloadings 
table of contents increased over in  costs for trucking services provided by intermodal carriers remained flat as we substantially reduced expenses associated with network inefficiencies 
higher diesel fuel prices increased sales and use taxes in  which resulted in higher state and local taxes 
other contract expenses for equipment maintenance and other services increased in the january west coast storm and hurricanes katrina and rita also contributed to higher expenses in net of insurance settlements received 
partially offsetting these increases was a reduction in relocation expenses as we incurred higher relocation costs associated with moving support personnel to omaha  nebraska during non operating items millions of dollars change v change v other income interest expense income taxes other income lower net gains from non operating asset sales and higher expenses due to rising interest rates associated with our sale of receivables program resulted in a reduction in other income in  which was partially offset by higher rental income for the use of our right of way including settlements of rate disputes from prior years and cash investment returns due to higher interest rates 
in  other income increased largely as a result of higher gains from real estate sales partially offset by higher expenses due to rising interest rates associated with our sale of receivables program 
interest expense lower interest expense in and was primarily due to declining weighted average debt levels of billion  billion  and billion in   and  respectively 
a higher effective interest rate of in  compared to in both and  partially offset the effects of the declining debt level 
income taxes income tax expense was million higher in than higher pre tax income resulted in additional taxes of million and million of the increase resulted from the one time reduction in described below 
our effective tax rate was and in and  respectively 
income taxes were greater in than due to higher pre tax income partially offset by a previously reported reduction in income tax expense 
in our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended june   we reported that the corporation analyzed the impact that final settlements of pre tax years had on previously recorded estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the completed analysis of the final settlements for pre tax years  along with internal revenue service examination reports for tax years through were considered  among other things  in a review and re evaluation of the corporation s estimated deferred tax assets and liabilities as of september   resulting in an income tax expense reduction of million in

lease adjusted debt to capital should be considered in addition to  rather than as a substitute for  debt to capital 
the table above provides support for the lease adjusted debt to capital calculation 
our debt to capital ratios improved as a result of a million reduction in debt from december   and an increase in retained earnings due to higher net income in 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of december   our principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents  the sale of receivables  and our revolving credit facilities  as well as the availability of commercial paper and other sources of financing through the capital markets 
we had billion of committed credit facilities available  of which there were no borrowings outstanding as of december   and we did not make any short term borrowings under these facilities during the year 
the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the sale of receivables program was million as of december  the sale of receivables program is subject to certain requirements  including the maintenance of an investment grade bond rating 
if our bond rating were to deteriorate  it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity 
access to commercial paper is dependent on market conditions 
deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact our ability to utilize commercial paper as a source of liquidity 
liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on our financial stability 
at both december  and  we had a working capital deficit of approximately billion 
a working capital deficit is common in our industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity 
we maintain adequate resources to meet our daily cash requirements  and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities 
financial condition cash flows millions of dollars cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash used in financing activities net change in cash and cash equivalents cash provided by operating activities higher income in generated the increased cash provided by operating activities  which was partially offset by higher income tax payments  million in voluntary pension contributions  higher material and supply inventories  and higher management incentive payments in higher income  lower management incentive payments in executive bonuses  which would have been paid to individuals in  were not awarded based on company performance in and bonuses for the professional workforce that were paid out in were significantly reduced  and working capital performance generated higher cash from operating activities in a voluntary pension contribution of million in also augmented the positive year over year variance in as no pension contribution was made in this improvement was partially offset by cash received in for income tax refunds 
cash used in investing activities an insurance settlement for the january west coast storm and lower balances for work in process decreased the amount of cash used in investing activities in higher capital investments and lower proceeds from asset sales partially offset this decrease 
increased capital spending  partially offset by higher proceeds from asset sales  increased the amount of cash used in investing activities in compared to cash used in financing activities the increase in cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from lower net proceeds from equity compensation plans million in compared to million in

table of contents the table below details cash capital investments for the years ended december    and millions of dollars track capacity and commercial facilities locomotives and freight cars other total in  we expect our total capital investments to be approximately billion  which may include long term leases 
these investments will be used to maintain track and structures  continue capacity expansions on our main lines in constrained corridors  remove bottlenecks  upgrade and augment equipment to better meet customer needs  build and improve facilities and terminals  and develop and implement new technologies 
we designed these investments to maintain infrastructure for safety  enhance customer service  promote growth  and improve operational fluidity 
we expect to fund our cash capital investments through cash generated from operations  the sale or lease of various operating and non operating properties  and cash on hand at december  we expect that these sources will continue to provide sufficient funds to meet our expected capital requirements for for the years ended december    and  our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was   and  respectively 
the increases in and were driven by higher net income 
the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a consolidated basis 
earnings represent income from continuing operations  less equity earnings net of distributions  plus fixed charges and income taxes 
fixed charges represent interest charges  amortization of debt discount  and the estimated amount representing the interest portion of rental charges 
see exhibit for the calculation of the ratio of earnings to fixed charges 
financing activities credit facilities on december   we had billion in revolving credit facilities available  including billion under a five year facility expiring in march and billion under a five year facility expiring in march collectively  the facilities 
the facilities are designated for general corporate purposes and support the issuance of commercial paper 
neither of the facilities were drawn on in commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facilities are similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated investment grade borrowers 
these facilities allow for borrowings at floating rates based on london interbank offered rates  plus a spread  depending upon our senior unsecured debt ratings 
the facilities require the maintenance of a minimum net worth and a debt to net worth coverage ratio 
at december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
the facilities do not include any other financial restrictions  credit rating triggers other than rating dependent pricing  or any other provision that could require the posting of collateral 
in addition to our revolving credit facilities  we had million in uncommitted lines of credit available  including million that expires in march and million expiring in may neither of these lines of credit were used as of december  we must have equivalent credit available under our five year facilities to draw on these million lines 
dividends on january   we increased the quarterly dividend to per share  payable beginning on april   to shareholders of record on february  we expect to fund the increase in the quarterly dividend through cash generated from operations  the sale or lease of various operating and non operating properties  and cash on hand at december  dividend restrictions we are subject to certain restrictions related to the payment of cash dividends to our shareholders due to minimum net worth requirements under our credit facilities 
retained earnings available 
table of contents for dividends increased to billion at december   from billion at december  we do not expect that these restrictions will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition  or liquidity 
common stock repurchases on january   our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to million shares of our common stock through december  we may make these repurchases on the open market or through other transactions 
our management will have sole discretion with respect to determining the timing and amount of these transactions 
we expect to fund our common stock repurchases through cash generated from operations  the sale or lease of various operating and non operating properties  and cash on hand at december  shelf registration statement under a current shelf registration statement  we may issue any combination of debt securities  preferred stock  common stock  or warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in one or more offerings 
at december   we had million remaining for issuance under the current shelf registration statement 
we have no immediate plans to issue any securities  however  we routinely consider and evaluate opportunities to replace existing debt or access capital through issuances of debt securities under this shelf registration  and  therefore  we may issue debt securities at any time 
operating lease activities as of december   our contractual obligations for operating leases totaled approximately billion 
discounted at  the present value of this obligation was approximately billion 
the railroad  as lessee  entered into long term operating lease arrangements during to finance the majority of its new equipment acquisitions 
in  the lessors under these lease arrangements purchased locomotives and  freight cars from the corporation through various financing transactions with a total equipment cost of approximately million and a present value of million 
these new lease arrangements provide for minimum total rental payments of approximately million and are reflected in the contractual obligations table as of december  the lessors financed the purchase of the locomotives and freight cars  in part  by the issuance of equipment notes that are non recourse to the railroad and are secured by an assignment of the underlying leases and a security interest in the various types of equipment 
neither the railroad nor upc guarantees payment of the equipment notes 
the railroad s obligations to make operating lease payments under the leases are recourse obligations and are not recorded in the consolidated statements of financial position 
the railroad has certain renewal and purchase options with respect to the locomotives and freight cars 
if the railroad does not exercise any such options  the equipment will be returned to the lessors at the end of the lease term 
contractual obligations and commitments as described in the notes to the financial statements and supplementary data  item  and as referenced in the tables below  we have contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect our financial condition 
however  based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments  including material sources of off balance sheet and structured finance arrangements  there is no known trend  demand  commitment  event  or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition  or liquidity 
in addition  the commercial obligations  financings  and commitments made by us are customary transactions that are similar to those of other comparable corporations  particularly within the transportation industry

d 
none of the letters of credit were drawn upon as of december  off balance sheet arrangements sale of receivables the railroad transfers most of its accounts receivable to union pacific receivables  inc upri  a bankruptcy remote subsidiary  as part of a sale of receivables facility 
upri sells  without recourse on a day revolving basis  an undivided interest in such accounts receivable to investors 
the total capacity to sell undivided interests to investors under the facility was million at both december  and the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the facility was million at both december  and  respectively 
the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors is not included in our consolidated financial statements 
the value of the undivided interest held by investors was supported by  million and  million of accounts receivable held by upri at december  and  respectively 
at december  and  the value of the interest retained by upri was million and million  respectively 
this retained interest is included in accounts receivable in our consolidated financial statements 
the interest sold to investors is sold at carrying value  which approximates fair value  and there is no gain or loss recognized from the transaction 

table of contents the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors could fluctuate based upon the availability of eligible receivables and is directly affected by changing business volumes and credit risks  including default and dilution 
if default or dilution percentages were to increase one percentage point  the amount of eligible receivables would decrease by million 
should our credit rating fall below investment grade  the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors would be reduced  and  in certain cases  the investors would have the right to discontinue the facility 
the railroad services the sold receivables  however  the railroad does not recognize any servicing asset or liability as the servicing fees adequately compensate the railroad for its responsibilities 
the railroad collected approximately billion and billion during the years ended december  and  respectively 
upri used certain of these proceeds to purchase new receivables under the facility 
the costs of the sale of receivables program are included in other income and were million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
the costs include interest  program fees paid to banks  commercial paper issuing costs  and fees for unused commitment availability 
the investors have no recourse to the railroad s other assets except for customary warranty and indemnity claims 
creditors of the railroad have no recourse to the assets of upri 
in august  the sale of receivables program was renewed for an additional day period without any significant changes in terms 
guarantees at december   we were contingently liable for million in guarantees 
we have recognized a million liability for the fair value of these obligations as of december  we entered into these contingent guarantees in the normal course of business  and they include guaranteed obligations related to our headquarters building  equipment financings  and affiliated operations 
the final guarantee expires in we are not aware of any existing event of default that would require us to satisfy these guarantees 
we do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
other matters inflation the cumulative effect of long periods of inflation significantly increases asset replacement costs for capital intensive companies 
as a result  assuming that we replace all operating assets at current price levels  depreciation charges on an inflation adjusted basis would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts 
derivative financial instruments we may use derivative financial instruments in limited instances for other than trading purposes to assist in managing our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and fuel prices 
we are not a party to leveraged derivatives and  by policy  do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
derivative financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged  both at inception and throughout the hedged period 
we formally document the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as our risk management objectives  strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions  and method of assessing hedge effectiveness 
changes in the fair market value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are charged to earnings 
we may use swaps  collars  futures  and or forward contracts to mitigate the risk of adverse movements in interest rates and fuel prices  however  the use of these derivative financial instruments may limit future benefits from favorable price movements 
market and credit risk we address market risk related to derivative financial instruments by selecting instruments with value fluctuations that highly correlate with the underlying hedged item 
credit risk related to derivative financial instruments  which is minimal  is managed by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and periodic settlements 
at december  and  we were not required to provide collateral  nor had we received collateral  relating to our hedging activities 

table of contents determination of fair value we determined the fair values of our derivative financial instrument positions at december  and based upon current fair values as quoted by recognized dealers or developed based upon the present value of expected future cash flows 
sensitivity analyses the sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical changes in interest rates could have on our results of operations and financial condition 
these hypothetical changes do not consider other factors that could impact actual results 
interest rate fair value hedges we manage our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by adjusting the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt instruments within our debt portfolio over a given period 
we generally manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt through the issuance of targeted amounts of each as debt matures or as we require incremental borrowings 
we employ derivatives  primarily swaps  as one of the tools to obtain the targeted mix 
in addition  we also obtain flexibility in managing interest costs and the interest rate mix within our debt portfolio by evaluating the issuance of and managing outstanding callable fixed rate debt securities 
swaps allow us to convert debt from fixed rates to variable rates and thereby hedge the risk of changes in the debt s fair value attributable to the changes in interest rates 
we account for swaps as fair value hedges using the short cut method pursuant to financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  therefore  we do not record any ineffectiveness within our consolidated financial statements 
as of december  and  we had interest rate swaps hedging debt of million and million  respectively 
at december  and  we had variable rate debt representing approximately and  respectively  of our total debt 
if variable interest rates average one percentage point higher in than our december  variable rate  which was approximately  our interest expense would increase by approximately million 
if variable interest rates averaged one percentage point higher in than our december  variable rate  which was approximately  our interest expense would have increased by approximately million 
these amounts were determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the balances of our variable rate debt at december  and  respectively 
market risk for fixed rate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of december   and amounts to approximately million at december  market risk resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of december   amounted to approximately million at december  we estimated the fair values of our fixed rate debt by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and current borrowing rates 
interest rate cash flow hedges we report changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item affects earnings 
at december   we had a reduction of million recorded as an accumulated other comprehensive loss that is being amortized on a straight line basis through september  as of december  and  we had no interest rate cash flow hedges outstanding 
fuel cash flow hedges fuel costs are a significant portion of our total operating expenses 
in and  our primary means of mitigating the impact of adverse fuel price changes was our fuel surcharge programs 
however  we may use swaps  collars  futures and or forward contracts to further mitigate the impact of adverse fuel price changes 
we did not have any fuel hedges in place during or we hedged million gallons of fuel during using collars with average cap  floor  and ceiling prices of   and per gallon  respectively 
fuel swaps we entered into two fuel basis swaps for the period august through july  which cover a total of million gallons of diesel fuel 
these commodity basis swaps require us to make payments to  
table of contents or receive payments from  the counterparty based on the difference between certain price indices 
changes in the fair value of these swaps are reflected in fuel expense 
we reported a derivative asset of approximately million at december   which represents the fair value of the swaps 
the swaps reduced fuel expense for by million  which included monthly net settlements with the counterparty and the fair value recognition at december  accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
under the interpretation  we will recognize tax benefits only for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
the amount recognized will be measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the interpretation is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of the cumulative effect of adopting fin will be a one time reduction in the january  balance of retained earnings 
future changes in uncertain tax positions will be included in income tax expense 
we do not expect that the cumulative effect of adopting fin will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurement fas 
while this statement does not require new fair value measurements  it provides guidance on applying fair value and expands required disclosures 
fas is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of we are currently assessing the impact fas may have on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans fas 
fas required us to recognize the funded status of our pension and postretirement plans in the balance sheet  along with a corresponding noncash  after tax adjustment to shareholders equity 
funded status is determined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation 
changes in the funded status will be recognized in other comprehensive loss 
we adopted fas at the end of and have disclosed the impact of the adoption in note of the financial statements and supplementary data  item in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements 
sab requires registrants to quantify misstatements using both an income statement and balance sheet approach and then evaluate whether either approach results in a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
if prior year errors that had been previously considered immaterial are now considered material based on either approach  no restatement is required so long as management properly applied its previous approach and all relevant facts and circumstances were considered 
if prior year s financial statements are not restated  the cumulative effect adjustment is recorded in opening accumulated earnings deficit as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption 
sab was effective for us at the end of the adoption of sab did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities fas 
this statement  which is expected to expand fair value measurement  permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
fas is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of we are currently assessing the impact fas may have on our consolidated financial statements 
asserted and unasserted claims various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries 
it is not possible at this time for us to determine fully the effect of all unasserted claims on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition  or liquidity  however  to the extent possible  where unasserted claims are considered probable and where such claims can be reasonably estimated  we have recorded 
table of contents a liability 
we do not expect that any known lawsuits  claims  environmental costs  commitments  contingent liabilities  or guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition  or liquidity after taking into account liabilities previously recorded for these matters 
indemnities our maximum potential exposure under indemnification arrangements  including certain tax indemnifications  can range from a specified dollar amount to an unlimited amount  depending on the nature of the transactions and the agreements 
due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved  we cannot reasonably determine the probability of an adverse claim or reasonably estimate any adverse liability or the total maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements 
we do not have any reason to believe that we will be required to make any material payments under these indemnity provisions 
insurance subsidiaries we have two consolidated  wholly owned subsidiaries that provide insurance coverage for certain risks  including physical loss or property damage and certain other claims that are subject to reinsurance 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenue  expenses  assets  and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the following critical accounting policies are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in note to the financial statements and supplementary data  item these critical accounting policies affect significant areas of our financial statements and involve judgment and estimates 
if these estimates differ significantly from actual results  the impact on our consolidated financial statements may be material 
asbestos we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits in which current and former employees allege exposure to asbestos 
during  we engaged a third party with extensive experience in estimating resolution costs for asbestos related claims to assist us in assessing our potential liability 
as a result of this assessment  we increased our liability in for resolving both asserted and unasserted asbestos related claims through this liability excludes future defense and processing costs 
the liability for resolving both asserted and unasserted claims was based on the following assumptions the number of future claims received would be consistent with historical averages 
the number of claims filed against us will decline each year 
the average settlement values for asserted and unasserted claims will be equivalent to historical averages 
the percentage of claims dismissed in the future will be equivalent to historical averages 
our asbestos related liabilities were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the current portion of asbestos related liabilities was million and million  respectively 
approximately of the recorded liability related to asserted claims and approximately related to unasserted claims 
these claims are expected to be paid out over the next years 
we have insurance coverage for a portion of the costs incurred to resolve asbestos related claims  and  as a result of the assessment  we increased our receivable for insurance recoveries related to asbestos during we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at december  and 
table of contents our asbestos related claims activity was as follows claims activity open claims  beginning balance new claims settled or dismissed claims open claims  ending balance at december during and our third party consultants assisted us in reviewing our actual asbestos claim experience compared to the assumptions used in the estimate  and we determined that no adjustment was necessary 
we will continue to review actual experience and adjust our estimate as warranted 
we believe that our liability for asbestos related claims and the estimated insurance recoveries reflect reasonable and probable estimates 
the amounts recorded for asbestos related liabilities and related insurance recoveries were based on currently known facts 
however  future events  such as the number of new claims to be filed each year  average settlement costs  and insurance coverage issues could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than the projected amounts 
estimates may also vary due to changes to strategies  activities  and outcomes of asbestos litigation  federal and state law governing litigation and compensation of asbestos claimants  and the level of payments made to claimants by other defendants 
environmental we are subject to federal  state  and local environmental laws and regulations 
we identified sites at which we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements 
this includes sites that are the subject of actions taken by the us government  of which are currently on the superfund national priorities list 
certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites  consequently  our ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties  in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site 
our environmental site activity was as follows site activity open sites  beginning balance new sites closed sites open sites  ending balance at december when we identify an environmental issue with respect to property owned  leased  or otherwise used in the conduct of our business  we and our consultants perform environmental assessments on the property 
we expense the cost of the assessments as incurred 
we accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and we can reasonably estimate such costs 
we do not discount our environmental liabilities when the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable 
environmental expense for the years ended december    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
as of december  and  we had a liability of million and million  respectively  accrued for future environmental costs  of which million and million  respectively  were recorded in current liabilities as accrued casualty costs 
the liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites  as well as ongoing monitoring costs  but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties 
cost estimates are based on information available for each site  financial viability of other 
table of contents potentially responsible parties  and existing technology  laws  and regulations 
the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties involved  site specific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties  the degree of contamination by various wastes  the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites  and the speculative nature of remediation costs 
current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition  or liquidity 
personal injury the cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year 
we use third party actuaries to assist us with measuring the expense and liability  including unasserted claims 
the federal employers liability act fela governs compensation for work related accidents 
under fela  damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or out of court settlements 
we offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work 
annual expenses for personal injury related events were million in  million in  and million in as of december  and  we had accrued liabilities of million and million for future personal injury costs  respectively  of which million and million was recorded in current liabilities as accrued casualty costs  respectively 
our personal injury liability is discounted to present value using applicable us treasury rates 
approximately of the recorded liability related to asserted claims  and approximately related to unasserted claims 
estimates can vary over time due to evolving trends in litigation 
our personal injury claims activity was as follows claims activity open claims  beginning balance new claims settled or dismissed claims open claims  ending balance at december depreciation the railroad industry is capital intensive 
properties are carried at cost 
provisions for depreciation are computed principally on the straight line method based on estimated service lives of depreciable property 
the lives are calculated using a separate composite annual percentage rate for each depreciable property group  based on the results of internal depreciation studies 
we are required to submit a report on depreciation studies and proposed depreciation rates to the stb for review and approval every three years for equipment property and every six years for road property 
the cost net of salvage of depreciable railroad property retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation  and no gain or loss is recognized 
a gain or loss is recognized in other income for all other property upon disposition because the gain or loss is not part of rail operations 
the cost of internally developed software is capitalized and amortized over a five year period 
significant capital spending in recent years increased the total value of our depreciable assets 
cash capital spending totaled billion for the year ended december  for the year ended december   depreciation expense was billion 
we use various methods to estimate useful lives for each group of depreciable property 
due to the capital intensive nature of the business and the large base of depreciable assets  variances to those estimates could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were increased by one year  annual depreciation expense would decrease by approximately million 
if the estimated useful lives of all assets to be depreciated were decreased by one year  annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately million 
income taxes as required under fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  we account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
these 
table of contents expected future tax consequences are measured based on provisions of tax law as currently enacted  the effects of future changes in tax laws are not anticipated 
future tax law changes  such as a change in the corporate tax rate  could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
for example  a increase in the federal income tax rate would increase our deferred tax liability by approximately million 
when appropriate  we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate  we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  based in part on management s judgments regarding the best available evidence about future events 
based on that analysis  we recorded a valuation allowance of million against certain deferred tax assets as of december  there was no valuation allowance as of december  pension and other postretirement benefits we use third party actuaries to assist us in properly measuring the liabilities and expenses associated with providing pension and defined contribution medical and life insurance benefits opeb to eligible employees 
in order to use actuarial methods to value the liabilities and expenses we must make several assumptions 
the critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on pension assets 
for opeb  the critical assumptions are the discount rate and healthcare cost trend rate 
we evaluate our critical assumptions at least annually  and selected assumptions are based on the following factors discount rate is based on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds rated aa by a recognized rating agency for which the timing and amount of cash flows matches our plan s expected benefit payments 
expected return on plan assets is based on our asset allocation mix and our historical return  taking into consideration current and expected market conditions 
healthcare cost trend rate is based on our historical rates of inflation and expected market conditions 
the following tables present the key assumptions used to measure pension and opeb expense for and the estimated impact on pension and opeb expense relative to a change in those assumptions assumptions pension opeb discount rate salary increase n a expected return on plan assets n a healthcare cost trend rate current n a level in n a sensitivities increase in expense millions of dollars pension opeb decrease in discount rate increase in salary scale n a decrease in expected return on plan assets n a increase in healthcare cost trend rate n a
