internet operations 
in  we established wet seal online  a web based store located at www 
wetseal 
com  offering wet seal merchandise to customers over the internet 
in august  we expanded our online operations with the launch of www 
ardenb 
com  offering arden b apparel and accessories comparable to those carried in the stores 
our online stores are designed to serve as an extension of the in store experience  and offer a wide selection of merchandise  which helps expand in store sales 
in fiscal  we experienced rapid growth in our online sales and we will continue to develop our wet seal and arden b websites to increase their effectiveness in marketing our brands 
our stores in december  we announced the closing of approximately wet seal stores as part of our turnaround strategy 
we completed our inventory liquidation sales and the closing of wet seal stores in march during fiscal  we scaled back plans to open new stores in an effort to limit capital expenditures and concentrate our efforts on restoring the core business 
during fiscal  we opened wet seal and four arden b stores and closed four wet seal and four arden b stores 
we believe future closures for at least the next months following the date of this annual report will primarily result from lease expirations where we decide not to extend  or are unable to extend  a store lease 
our ability to increase the number of wet seal and arden b stores in the future will depend  in part  on satisfactory cash flows from existing operations  the demand for our merchandise  our ability to find suitable mall or other locations with acceptable sites and satisfactory terms  and general business conditions 
our management does not believe there are significant geographic constraints on the locations of future stores 
for fiscal  we intend to open to new wet seal and or arden b stores  net of store closures at lease expiration 
we have approximately existing store leases scheduled to expire in fiscal we expect to negotiate new leases that will allow us to remain in a substantial majority of these locations 
competitive strengths strong brand positions in our wet seal and arden b divisions 
in contrast with diversified apparel retailers  we focus on satisfying the fashion needs of two distinct customers  teenage girls age to  and women age to  through our wet seal and arden b brands 
through these two brands  we are able to closely identify with our customers and implement merchandising practices that more effectively reflect their changing fashion needs 
both of our divisions deliver fashionable  trend right apparel and accessories at competitive prices for a wide variety of occasions 

table of contents key management team is now in place 
with the appointments of dyan jozwick  gregory gemette  gary white and john luttrell  our senior management team is now in place 
we believe that we now have people who have the requisite experience and who are committed to contributing to our company s turnaround and driving our company into the next phase of its growth cycle 
dyan jozwick  our chief merchandise officer  wet seal division  joined us in may from robinsons may with years of retail industry experience 
ms 
jozwick s prior history in the juniors market will help us to strengthen the wet seal business 
gregory gemette  our president of merchandise  arden b  joined us in march with years of retail industry experience 
mr 
gemette s merchandising background at the limited and american eagle will assist us in developing and building the arden b business 
in addition to mr 
gemette and ms 
jozwick  we have added depth in our merchandising organizations at both wet seal and arden b 
gary white  our chief operating officer  joined us in july as senior vice president of sales and operations and was promoted in april to chief operating officer 
with over years of retail industry experience  mr 
white brings experience in store operations  construction and development  real estate and purchasing 
john luttrell  our chief financial officer  joined us in december from cost plus  inc with over ten years of retail industry experience 
mr 
luttrell s public accounting background and experience with rapid growth  large  multi store companies  will help us execute our near term and long term strategies 
we believe we have retained a full complement of top quality merchants  designers  planners and procurement specialists and have filled our senior merchant ranks at both divisions 
merchandising model at wet seal focused on fast fashion at affordable prices 
at wet seal  we have developed considerable expertise in identifying  stocking and selling a broad assortment of fresh  fashionable apparel and accessories at competitive prices 
our buyers work closely with senior management to determine the optimal product selection  promotion and pricing strategy 
a significant portion of our merchandise is sourced domestically 
this sourcing strategy enables us to ship new merchandise to the stores with high frequency 
we also take regular markdowns to effect the rapid sale of slow moving inventory 
improved financial condition 
since the completion of a recapitalization of our company in may  our financial condition has improved materially 
during fiscal and fiscal  we realized seven out of eight consecutive quarters of positive comparable store sales growth and had positive cash flow from operations in each of those fiscal years 
due to the strength of our financial performance since the end of fiscal  we have been able to reduce our outstanding indebtedness 
through fiscal  million in principal amount of our convertible notes had been converted into shares of our class a common stock 
we used the proceeds from a may financing transaction to repay a bridge loan that we received from investors in a january recapitalization of our company 
in addition  in march  we repaid the million outstanding balance of a junior secured term loan under our then existing credit facility 
as of february   our total debt  net of discount  is million  stockholders equity is million and cash and cash equivalents is million 
this improvement in our financial condition allows us to invest in opening new wet seal and arden b stores 
growth strategy we believe we have significant growth potential 
the key elements of our growth strategy are to expand our retail store base 
our two retail store divisions have broad national appeal  presenting substantial new store expansion opportunities 
we believe we took a conservative approach to expansion in fiscal to allow for the rebuilding of our store development team 
if current business trends continue  we expect to accelerate the number of store openings beginning in fiscal 
table of contents take advantage of compelling new store economics 
in relation to many of our competitors  we currently have a modest number of stores supporting our operations 
therefore  we believe that we have significant opportunity for growth and leverage in store operations  distribution  buying and merchandising 
currently  new stores we open generally require us to make a capital investment of  to  per store 
in addition  in some cases  we receive tenant improvement allowances from landlords to defray certain costs of a new store build out 
these allowances  when granted  will reduce the estimated capital requirements noted above 
continue our positive comparable store sales trend 
since we initiated our turnaround strategy in november  we experienced seven out of eight quarters of positive comparable store sales results versus the negative comparable store sales trends of fiscal these improvements resulted primarily from increased transaction counts and the number of items purchased per customer  partially offset by a decrease in average retail price per item sold due to a change in pricing strategy 
logo note the numbers in the foregoing charts do not include sales from discontinued operations 
for fiscal  we experienced moderate growth in comparable store sales results versus the dramatically improved results we began to see in fiscal in the second fiscal quarter of  we experienced a decline in comparable store sales principally due to a merchandising misstep and delays in inventory receipts  which caused our wet seal stores to lack fashion tops and dresses in may and june our merchandising team identified the issue and adjusted purchasing levels  thus restoring our positive comparable store sales momentum in each month from july through the end of fiscal the wet seal s fast fashion  value driven strategy resulted in a reduction in average unit retail selling prices  an increase in transactions generated and an increase in average number of units per customer for fiscal with a more value oriented pricing strategy  we believe we have been able to increase the number of customers and their purchases and the number of units purchased per transaction 
revive arden b 
since the arrival of gregory gemette at arden b in march  we have focused on redefining the arden b woman and brand positioning 
we are adjusting our assortments at arden b to be fashion right  focused and cohesive 
arden b is a unique division that we believe has yet to achieve its full potential with its core customer 
through a new approach to merchandising and improvements in advertising  we intend to create a feminine  sophisticated brand for the modern woman who wants to project an appropriate level of sex appeal 
we aim to drive sales and profitability at arden b through distinctive  quality merchandise  unified apparel and accessory assortments and an improved in store customer experience 

table of contents expand our online business 
we plan to grow our internet business through several initiatives  including a focus on integrated branding  targeted marketing programs utilizing our customer database and our customer loyalty programs 
although our internet sales are modest  we are experiencing substantial growth 
a combination of several changes contributed to the improvement  including hiring the right staff with internet marketing experience  changing processes to make them scalable  aligning the online sites to the look of the stores and implementing appropriate targeted marketing 
we are optimizing inventory allocated to the internet business to better meet demand and we have strengthened our buying and planning staff to meet the anticipated sales growth in this area 
design  buying and product development our design and buying teams are responsible for identifying evolving fashion trends and developing themes to guide our merchandising strategy 
each retail concept has a separate buying team 
the merchandising team for each retail concept develops fashion themes and strategies through assessing customer responses to current trends  shopping the european market and the appropriate domestic vendor base and through the use of fashion services and gathering references from industry publications 
after selecting fashion themes  the design and buying teams work closely with vendors to use colors  materials and designs that create images consistent with the themes for our product offerings 
since fiscal  we have decreased our dependency on internally designed merchandise in our wet seal division 
this allows us more flexibility to respond to the changing fashion trends of the junior customer  to buy in smaller lots and to reduce product development lead times 
see also allocation and distribution below 
marketing  advertising and promotion we believe that our brands are among our most important assets 
our ability to successfully increase brand awareness is dependent upon our ability to address the changing needs and priorities of each brand s target customers 
we continue to invest in the development of our brands through customer research  print advertising  in store marketing and the maintenance of our internet presence 
during fiscal   and  we spent   and  respectively  of net sales on advertising 
in fiscal  our primary marketing focus was on in store promotion programs for the wet seal stores and print media for the arden b stores  which included publications in vogue throughout the year 
as discussed further in note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere within this annual report  we offer a frequent buyer program in our wet seal stores in order to build loyalty to the brand  increase the frequency of visits  promote multiple item purchases and gain direct access to the customer 
as part of this program we send e mails to participants to notify them of special in store promotions 
our arden b concept also offers a loyalty program  b rewarded  designed for the same purposes as those of our wet seal concept 
sourcing and vendor relationships we purchase our merchandise from both domestic and foreign vendors 
for fiscal  approximately of our retail receipts were directly imported from vendors 
although in fiscal no single vendor provided more than of our merchandise  management believes we are the largest customer of many of our smaller vendors 
quality control is monitored at the distribution points of our largest vendors and manufacturers  and merchandise is inspected upon arrival at our foothill ranch  california distribution center 
we do not maintain any long term or exclusive commitments or arrangements to purchase merchandise from any single supplier  and there are many vendors who could supply our merchandise 

table of contents allocation and distribution our merchandising effort primarily focuses on maintaining a regular flow of fresh  fashionable merchandise into our stores 
successful execution depends in large part on our integrated planning  allocation and distribution functions 
by working closely with store operations management and merchandise buyers  our teams of planners and allocators manage inventory levels and coordinate the allocation of merchandise to each of our stores based on sales volume and store size  demographics  climate and other factors that may influence an individual store s product mix 
all merchandise for retail stores is received from vendors at our foothill ranch  california distribution center  where items are inspected and prepared for shipping to our stores 
we ship all of our merchandise to our stores by common carrier 
consistent with our goal of maintaining the freshness of our product offerings  we frequently ship new merchandise to stores  and markdowns are taken regularly to effect the rapid sale of slow moving inventory 
marked down merchandise that remains unsold is either sent to a clearance center for deep discounting and rapid movement  sold to an outside clearance company or given to charity 
the fulfillment process and distribution of merchandise for our online business is performed at our foothill ranch distribution center 
information and control systems our merchandise  financial and store computer systems are integrated and operate using primarily oracle technology 
we have invested in a large data warehouse that provides management  buyers and planners comprehensive data that helps them identify emerging trends and manage inventories 
the core merchandise system is provided by a leading retail enterprise resource planning  or erp  software provider  and is frequently upgraded and enhanced to support strategic business initiatives 
all of our stores have a point of sale system operating on software provided by a leading provider of specialty retailing point of sale systems 
this system facilitates bar coded ticket scanning  automatic price look ups and centralized credit authorizations 
all stores are networked to the corporate office via a centrally managed virtual private network 
we utilize a store portal that is integrated with the corporate merchandise erp system to provide the stores and corporate staff with current information regarding sales  promotions  inventory and shipments  and enables more efficient communications with the corporate office 
in fiscal  we installed in store radio frequency systems to manage inventory  upgraded direct marketing and customer loyalty systems  began implementing a revision to our merchandise allocation system  upgraded our company wide payroll system and upgraded our online business order fulfillment system 
in fiscal  we anticipate launching a new website platform for the online business  implementing a new time and attendance labor system and upgrading our erp system 
seasonality our business is seasonal by nature  with the christmas season  beginning the week of thanksgiving and ending the first saturday after christmas  and the back to school season  beginning the last week of july and ending mid september  historically accounting for a large percentage of sales volume 
for the past three fiscal years  the christmas and back to school seasons together accounted for an average of slightly more than of our annual sales 
our profitability depends  to a significant degree  on the sales generated during these peak periods 
any decrease in sales or margins during these periods  whether as a result of economic conditions  poor weather or other factors  could have a material adverse effect on our company 
trademarks our primary trademarks and service marks are wet seal and arden b  which are registered in the us patent and trademark office

competition the women s retail apparel industry is highly competitive  with fashion  quality  price  location and service being the principal competitive factors 
our wet seal and arden b stores compete with specialty apparel retailers  department stores and certain other apparel retailers  including aeropostale  anthropologie  abercrombie fitch  charlotte russe  gap  banana republic  h m  old navy  pacific sunwear  american eagle  target  urban outfitters  forever  express  jc penney  bebe  zara and bcbg 
many of our competitors are large national chains that have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
while we believe we compete effectively for favorable site locations and lease terms  competition for prime locations within malls is intense  and we cannot ensure that we will be able to obtain new locations on terms favorable to us  if at all 
customers our company s business is not dependent upon a single customer or small group of customers 
environmental matters we are not aware of any federal  state or local environmental laws or regulations that will materially affect our earnings or competitive position  or result in material capital expenditures 
however  we cannot predict the effect on our operations of possible future environmental legislation or regulations 
during fiscal  there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no such material expenditures are anticipated for fiscal government regulation our company is subject to various federal  state and local laws affecting our business 
each of our company s stores must comply with licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities in jurisdictions in which the store is located 
to date  our company has not been significantly affected by any difficulty  delay or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals 
our company is also subject to federal and state laws governing such matters as employment and pay practices  overtime and working conditions 
the bulk of our company s employees are paid on an hourly basis at rates related to the federal and state minimum wages 
in the past  we have been assessed penalties or paid settlements to gain dismissal of lawsuits for non compliance with certain of these laws  and future non compliance could result in a material adverse effect on our company s operations 
our company is also subject to the fair credit reporting act the act under federal law  as well as to state laws with similar requirements  with respect to the protection our customers credit and debit card and other personal data 
in january and february  we were served with two class action complaints alleging violations of the act 
the act provides in part that expiration dates may not be printed together with certain parts of the customer s account number on credit or debit card receipts given to customers 
the act imposes significant penalties upon violators of these rules and regulations if the lack of compliance is deemed to have been willful 
otherwise  damages are limited to actual losses incurred 
our company does not believe that it has any liability for the violations alleged in the complaints and will vigorously contest these allegations 
however  in the event we are found to have liability under the act for these allegations  significant damages could be assessed against 
table of contents our company  and this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  any future non compliance with federal or state laws pertaining to the protection of customers personal data could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we continue to monitor our facilities for compliance with the americans with disabilities act  or the ada  in order to conform to its requirements 
under the ada  we could be required to expend funds to modify stores to better provide service to  or make reasonable accommodation for the employment of  disabled persons 
we believe that expenditures  if required  would not have a material adverse effect on our company s operations 
employees as of february   our operations had  employees  consisting of  full time employees and  part time employees 
full time personnel consisted of salaried employees and  hourly employees 
all part time personnel are hourly employees

all of our employees are non union  and  in management s opinion  are paid competitively at current industry standards 
we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 
item a 
risk factors risks related to our business our improvements in comparable store sales and operating results in fiscal and may not be indicative of trends in our future performance  and we may not be able to sustain or improve our results and achieve profitability 
during fiscal and  we experienced seven out of eight consecutive quarters of positive comparable store sales growth  and positive overall cash flow from operations in each of fiscal and however  we incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows during each of fiscal and which caused liquidity problems and resulted in very tight vendor payment terms 
in fiscal  we raised additional capital that ameliorated our liquidity problems 
our ability to maintain the success of our wet seal and arden b stores depends in large part on a number of factors  some of which are outside of our control  including accurate forecasting of demand and fashion trends  providing an appropriate mix of appealing merchandise for our targeted customer base  managing inventory effectively  using effective pricing strategies  selecting effective marketing techniques  optimizing store performance  negotiating acceptable renewals of expiring leases and general economic conditions 
for example  in the second quarter of fiscal  we experienced an inventory shortage in certain fashion tops and dresses in our wet seal division that negatively affected our comparable store sales performance 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to execute our plan to open additional stores or that such store openings will be successful 
successful implementation of our company s growth strategy depends on a number of factors including  but not limited to  obtaining desirable store locations  negotiating acceptable leases  completing projects on budget  supplying proper levels of merchandise and the hiring and training of store managers and sales associates 
the new stores may place increased demands on our company s operational  managerial and administrative resources  which could cause our company to operate less effectively 
furthermore  there is a possibility that new stores that are opened in existing markets may have an adverse effect on future sales of previously existing stores in such markets 
in addition  our failure to predict accurately the demographic or retail environment at any future store location could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we have had significant management changes during the past two fiscal years and these changes may impact our ability to execute our business strategy in the near term 
in general  our success depends to a significant extent on the performance of our senior management and on our ability to identify  hire and retain key management personnel 
in december and january  we appointed a new president and chief executive officer and four members to our board of directors 
in august  our executive vice president and chief financial officer resigned from our company  and was replaced by a new executive vice president and chief financial officer in december on march   two new members joined our board of directors 
effective march   the president of our arden b stores resigned and was replaced by a new president of arden b merchandise on march  on may   we hired our chief merchandise officer for our wet seal division 
we anticipate that we will continue to experience a transition period as this new management team is fully integrated 
due to the intense competition for qualified personnel in the retail apparel industry  we may not be able to identify  hire or retain key personnel with the merchandising and management skills necessary to consistently offer appealing products to our target market 
moreover  we are also exposed to employment practice litigation due to the large number of employees and high turnover of our sales associates 
if we fail to attract  motivate and retain qualified senior management personnel  it could harm our business and limit our ability to implement our growth strategy 
if our president and chief executive officer elects not to extend his employment contract in february  the continued implementation of our growth plan could be adversely impacted 
the term of mr 
joel n 
waller s employment contract expires on february  in the event mr 
waller s contract is not extended  the retention of a chief executive officer will involve a transition period for our management team and our board of directors  which may adversely impact the continued implementation of our growth plan 
the strategy for our arden b division implemented by our new arden b management team may not be successful 
our strategy for our arden b division may not be successful and we may have to write down the value of our arden b assets  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
the new president of merchandise for our arden b division  mr 
gregory gemette  joined us in march although mr 
gemette has put together a management team of design  operational and merchandising individuals with significant industry experience  the success of arden b is largely dependent upon its ability to design fashion that satisfies current fashion tastes and to provide merchandise in a timely manner for our customers 
to the extent there are design and or merchandising misjudgments or a lack of customer traffic in arden b stores  the operating results of arden b may be adversely and materially impacted 
in addition to our new design and merchandising strategy  we intend to increase the percentage of imported merchandise for our arden b stores during the next two fiscal years 
however  if there are delays in our import chain  cancellations of orders  or quality issues related to imported products  our results of operations could be significantly and adversely impacted due to decreased sales and or increased markdowns 
if we are unable to anticipate and react to new fashion trends and or if there is a decrease in the demand for fashionable apparel  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we rely on a limited demographic customer base for a large percentage of our sales 
our brand image is dependent upon our ability to anticipate  identify and provide fresh inventory reflecting current fashion trends 
if we fail to anticipate  identify or react appropriately or in a timely manner to these fashion trends  we could experience reduced consumer acceptance of our products  a diminished brand image and higher markdowns 

table of contents these factors could result in lower selling prices and sales volumes for our products  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our sales also depend upon the continued demand by our customers for fashion apparel 
demand for our merchandise could be negatively affected by shifts in consumer discretionary spending to other goods  such as electronic equipment  computers and music 
if the demand for apparel and related merchandise declines  our financial condition  cash flow and results of operations would be adversely affected 
since august  our company has been a defendant in a class action related to our company s securities 
as previously reported  our company and certain of our former directors and former officers have been named as defendants in several securities class actions filed on behalf of persons who purchased our class a common stock between january  and august  these actions have been consolidated in the united states district court for the central district of california 
the consolidated complaint alleged violations of section b of the exchange act and rule b promulgated thereunder  and section a of the exchange act by  among other allegations  making false and misleading statements concerning the progress of our company to stem the losses of our wet seal stores and return that business to profitability as well as the illegal use of material non public information by former directors and a company controlled by them 
the plaintiffs sought class certification  compensatory damages  interest  costs and attorneys fees and expenses 
on september   the consolidated class action was dismissed against all defendants in the lawsuit 
however  plaintiffs were granted leave to file an amended complaint  which they filed on november  we filed an additional motion to dismiss the amended complaint 
the motion was argued in a court hearing on october   but the court has not yet made a ruling on the motion 
in the event plaintiffs achieve a favorable outcome  significant damages could be assessed against our company that exceed available insurance coverage  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
two lawsuits have been filed against us alleging violations of the fair credit reporting act 
in january and february  we were served with two class action complaints alleging violations of the fair credit reporting act 
the act provides in part that portions of the credit card number may not be printed together with expiration dates on credit or debit card receipts given to customers 
the act imposes significant penalties upon violators of these rules and regulations where the violation is deemed to have been willful 
otherwise damages are limited to actual losses incurred by the card holder 
the company does not believe that it has any liability for the violations alleged in the complaints and will vigorously contest these allegations 
however  in the event we are found to have liability under the act for these allegations  significant damages could be assessed against our company and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
fluctuations in our results of operations for the third fiscal quarter and the fourth fiscal quarter would have a disproportionate effect on our overall financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we experience seasonal fluctuations in revenues and operating income  with a disproportionate amount of our revenues and a majority of our income being generated in the third fiscal quarter back to school season  which begins the last week of july and ends during september  and the fourth fiscal quarter holiday season 
our revenues and income are generally lower during the first and second fiscal quarters 
in addition  any factors that harm our third and fourth fiscal quarter operating results  including adverse weather or unfavorable economic conditions  could have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations for the entire fiscal year 
in order to prepare for our peak shopping season  we must order and keep in stock significantly more merchandise than we would carry at other times of the year 
an unanticipated decrease in demand for our 
table of contents products during our peak shopping season could require us to sell excess inventory at a substantial markdown  which could reduce our net sales and gross profit 
alternatively  an unanticipated increase in demand for certain of our products  as was the case in may and june of fiscal at our wet seal stores  could leave us unable to fulfill customer demand and result in lost sales and customer dissatisfaction 
our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors  including the timing of new store openings  the revenues contributed by new stores  merchandise mix and the timing and level of inventory markdowns 
as a result  historical period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results are not necessarily indicative of future period to period results 
you should not rely on the results of a single fiscal quarter  particularly the third fiscal quarter back to school season or fourth fiscal quarter holiday season  as an indication of our annual results or our future performance 
our failure to effectively compete with other retailers for sales and locations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the women s retail apparel industry is highly competitive  with fashion  quality  price  location and service being the principal competitive factors 
our wet seal and arden b stores compete with specialty apparel retailers  department stores and certain other apparel retailers  including aeropostale  anthropologie  abercrombie fitch  charlotte russe  gap  banana republic  h m  old navy  pacific sunwear  american eagle  target  urban outfitters  forever  express  jc penney  bebe  zara and bcbg 
many of our competitors are large national chains that have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
we face a variety of competitive challenges  including anticipating and quickly responding to changing consumer demands  maintaining favorable brand recognition and effectively marketing our products to consumers in narrowly defined market segments  developing innovative  high quality products in sizes  colors and styles that appeal to consumers in our target markets and maintaining a sufficient quantity of these items for which there is the greatest demand  obtaining favorable site locations within malls on reasonable terms  sourcing merchandise efficiently  and pricing our products competitively and achieving customer perception of value 
our industry has low barriers to entry that allow the introduction of new products or new competitors at a fast pace 
any of these factors could result in reductions in sales or the prices of our products which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
further  competition for prime locations and lease terms within shopping malls  in particular  is intense  and we may not be able to obtain new locations or maintain our existing locations on terms favorable to us 
the upcoming expiration of leases for approximately of our existing stores could lead to increased costs associated with renegotiating our leases and or relocating our stores 
we have approximately existing store leases scheduled to expire in fiscal in connection with the expiration of these leases  we will have to renegotiate new leases which could result in higher rental amounts for each store and landlord requirements to remodel existing locations as a condition for renewal 
although we expect to negotiate new leases with acceptable terms that will allow us to remain in a substantial majority of these locations  we may not be able to obtain new terms that are favorable to us 
in addition  as a result of renewal negotiations  we may be required by the landlord to remodel  which could result in significant capital expenditures 
in addition  some landlords may refuse to renew our leases due to our lower sales per square foot as

if we are unable to agree to new terms with our landlords  we will have to relocate these stores  which could result in a significant expenditure and could lead to an interruption in the operation of our business at the affected stores  and we could be required to relocate to less desirable locations 
because of the importance of our brand names  we may lose market share to our competitors if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights 
we believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to our success and our competitive position 
we have registered trademarks for wet seal and arden b which are registered in the retail store services class and pending in others 
we take actions to establish and protect our intellectual property 
however  others may infringe on our intellectual property rights or seek to block the sale of our products as violative of their intellectual property rights 
if we are required to stop using any of our registered or non registered trademarks  our sales could decline and  consequently  our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
our retail store operations are affected by local  regional and national economic conditions 
our business is sensitive to consumer spending patterns and preferences 
various economic conditions affect the level of spending on the merchandise we offer  including general business conditions  interest rates  taxation  the availability of consumer credit and consumer confidence in future economic conditions 
our growth  sales and profitability may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions on a local  regional or national level 
further  the majority of our stores are located in shopping malls 
we derive sales  in part  from the high volume of traffic in these malls 
the inability of mall anchor tenants and other area attractions to generate consumer traffic around our stores  or the decline in the popularity of malls as shopping destinations  would reduce our sales volume and  consequently  adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
covenants contained in agreements governing our existing indebtedness restrict the manner in which we conduct our business  and our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under these agreements  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  growth prospects and ability to procure merchandise for our stores 
our senior credit facility and the indenture  as amended  governing our secured convertible notes contain covenants that restrict the manner in which we conduct our business 
subject to certain exceptions including an exception to permit limited stock repurchases  these covenants restrict our ability to  among other things incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or refinance our existing indebtedness  make investments or acquisitions  merge  consolidate  dissolve or liquidate  engage in certain asset sales including the sale of stock  repurchase stock  grant liens on assets  pay dividends  and close stores 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the agreements governing our existing indebtedness  acceleration of any amounts then outstanding  the foreclosure upon collateral securing the debt obligations  or the unavailability of the lines of credit 

table of contents we depend upon a single center for our corporate offices and distribution activities  and any significant disruption in the operation of this center could harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our corporate offices and the distribution functions for all of our stores and internet business are handled from a single  leased facility in foothill ranch  california  and we do not have contracted back up operating facilities 
in general  this area of california is subject to earthquakes 
any significant interruption in the operation of this facility due to a natural disaster  accident  system failure or other unforeseen event could delay or impair our ability to distribute merchandise to our stores and  consequently  lead to a decrease in sales 
the financial losses incurred may exceed our insurance for earthquake damages and business interruption costs related to any such disruption 
as a result  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
furthermore  we have little experience operating essential functions away from our main corporate offices and are uncertain what effect operating such satellite facilities might have on our business  personnel and results of operations 
we do not authenticate the license rights of our suppliers 
we purchase merchandise from a number of vendors who purport to hold manufacturing and distribution rights under the terms of license agreements or that assert their products are not subject to any restrictions as to distribution 
we generally rely upon each vendor s representation concerning those manufacturing and distribution rights and do not independently verify whether each vendor legally holds adequate rights to the licensed properties they are manufacturing or distributing 
if we acquire unlicensed merchandise or merchandise violating a registered trademark  we could be obligated to remove it from our stores  incur costs associated with destruction of the merchandise if the vendor is unwilling or unable to reimburse us and be subject to civil and criminal liability 
the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we are subject to risks associated with our procurement of products from non us based vendors and non us vendors that purchase products internationally  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
a portion of our products is manufactured outside the united states 
as a result  we are susceptible to greater losses as a result of a number of risks inherent in doing business in international markets and from a number of factors beyond our control  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
these factors include import or trade restrictions including increased tariffs  customs duties  taxes or quotas imposed by the united states government in respect of the foreign countries in which our products are currently manufactured or any of the countries in which our products may be manufactured in the future  political instability or acts of terrorism  significant fluctuations in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies  restrictions on the transfer of funds between the united states and foreign jurisdictions  and or potential disruption of imports due to labor disputes at us ports  any of which could adversely affect our merchandise flow and  consequently  cause our sales to decline  and local business practices that do not conform to our legal or ethical guidelines 
our imports are limited by textile agreements between the united states and a number of foreign jurisdictions  including hong kong  china  taiwan and south korea 
these agreements impose quotas on the amounts and types of merchandise that may be imported into the united states from these countries 
these agreements also allow the united states to limit the importation of categories of merchandise that are not now subject to specified limits 
the united states and the countries in which our products are produced or sold may also  from time to time  impose new quotas  duties  tariffs or other restrictions  or adversely adjust prevailing quota  duty or tariff levels 
in addition  none of our international suppliers or international manufacturers supplies 
table of contents or manufactures our products exclusively 
as a result  we compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers and import quota capacity 
if we were unable to obtain our raw materials and finished apparel from the countries where we wish to purchase them  either because room under the necessary quotas was unavailable or for any other reason  or if the cost of doing so should increase  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
violation of labor laws and practices by our suppliers could harm our business and results of operations 
our company s policy is to use only those sourcing agents and independent manufacturers who operate in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
the violation of laws  particularly labor laws  by an independent manufacturer  or by one of the sourcing agents  or the divergence of an independent manufacturer s or sourcing agent s labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the united states or in the country in which the manufacturing facility is located  and the public revelation of those illegal or unethical practices  could cause significant damage to our company s reputation 
although our manufacturer operating guidelines promote ethical business practices  we do not control these manufacturers and cannot guarantee their legal and regulatory compliance 
we are exposed to business risks as a result of our internet operations 
we operate online stores at www 
wetseal 
com and www 
ardenb 
com 
our internet operations are subject to numerous risks  including online security breaches and or credit card fraud  reliance on third party software providers  and diversion of sales from our retail stores 
in addition  increased internet sales by our competitors could result in increased price competition and decreased margins 
our inability to effectively address these risks and any other risks that we face in connection with our internet operations could adversely affect the profitability of our internet operations 
risks related to our class a common stock our stockholders may experience additional dilution due to previous private placements of convertible securities as well as the issuance of additional securities in the future 
since may  we have completed private placements of class a common stock as well as warrants  convertible notes and shares of preferred stock that are convertible into or exercisable for shares of our class a common stock 
through february   we have issued  shares of our class a common stock as a result of these private placements and exercises and conversions of these securities 
an additional  shares of class a common stock may be issued under the convertible notes  preferred stock and warrants that remain outstanding  and this number of shares of class a common stock is subject to anti dilution adjustments based upon the anti dilution provisions contained in these instruments 
the issuance of the additional shares of class a common stock upon conversion and exercise could cause the market price of our class a common stock to decline 
in addition  the issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities would result in dilution of our existing stockholders equity interest 
the issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities could also trigger an anti dilution adjustment pursuant to outstanding warrants  convertible notes or preferred stock 

table of contents the price of our class a common stock has fluctuated significantly during the past few years and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
our class a common stock  which is traded on the nasdaq global market  has experienced and may continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations that could adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock 
the market price of our class a common stock is likely to fluctuate  both because of actual and perceived changes in our operating results and prospects and because of general volatility in the stock market 
the market price of our class a common stock could continue to fluctuate widely in response to factors such as actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations  the addition or loss of suppliers  customers and other business relationships  changes in financial estimates of  and recommendations by  securities analysts  conditions or trends in the apparel and consumer products industries  additions or departures of key personnel  sales of our class a common stock  general market and economic conditions  and other events or factors  including the realization of any of the risks described in this risk factors section  many of which are beyond our control 
fluctuations in the price and trading volume of our class a common stock in response to factors such as those set forth above could be unrelated or disproportionate to our actual operating performance 
we have never paid dividends on our class a common stock and do not plan to do so in the future 
holders of shares of our class a common stock are entitled to receive any dividends that may be declared by our board of directors 
however  we have not paid any cash dividends on our class a common stock and we do not expect to for the foreseeable future 
also  our agreements with our senior lenders and the indenture governing our notes restrict the payment of dividends to our stockholders 
our charter provisions  stockholder rights plan and delaware law may have anti takeover effects 
our certificate of incorporation permits our board of directors to designate and issue  without stockholder approval  up to  shares of preferred stock with voting  conversion and other rights and preferences that could differentially and adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our class a common stock  which could be used to discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal 
in addition  under certain circumstances our board of directors may grant rights to our stockholders under our stockholder rights plan 
furthermore  certain provisions of delaware law applicable to our company could also delay or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving our company  including section of the delaware general corporation law  which prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years unless certain conditions are met 
the possible issuance of preferred stock  the granting of rights to stockholders under our stockholder rights plan and the application of anti takeover provisions of delaware law could each have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of our company  including  without limitation  discouraging a proxy contest  making more difficult the acquisition of a substantial block of class a common stock and limiting the price that investors might in the future be willing to pay for shares of our class a common stock

executive overview we are a national specialty retailer operating stores selling fashionable and contemporary apparel and accessory items designed for female customers aged to we are a delaware corporation that operates two nationwide  primarily mall based  chains of retail stores under the names wet seal and arden b 
at february   we had retail stores in states  puerto rico and washington dc of the stores  there were wet seal stores and arden b stores 
we report our results of operations as one reportable segment representing the aggregation of our two retail brands and our internet business due to the similarities of the economic and operating characteristics of the operations represented by our two store concepts and internet business 
our fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to the end of january 
fiscal includes weeks of operations and fiscal and each includes weeks of operations 
we consider the following to be key performance indicators in evaluating our performance comparable store sales stores are deemed comparable stores on the first day of the month following the one year anniversary of their opening or significant remodel relocation  which we define to be a square footage increase or decrease of at least 
stores that are remodeled or relocated with a resulting square footage change of less than are maintained in the comparable store base with no interruption 
however  stores that are closed for four or more days in a fiscal month  due to remodel  relocation or other reasons  are removed from the comparable store base that fiscal month as well as for the comparable fiscal month in the following fiscal year 
comparable store sales results are important in achieving operating leverage on certain expenses such as store payroll  occupancy  depreciation and amortization  general and administrative expenses  and other costs that are at least partially fixed 
positive comparable store sales results generate greater operating leverage on expenses while negative comparable store sales results negatively affect operating leverage 
comparable store sales results also have a direct impact on our total net sales  cash  and working capital 
average transaction counts we consider the trend in the average number of sales transactions occurring in our stores to be a key performance metric 
to the extent we are able to increase transaction counts in our stores 
table of contents that more than offset any decrease in the average dollar sale per transaction  we will generate increases in our comparable store sales 
gross margins we analyze the components of gross margin  specifically initial markups and markdowns  buying costs  distribution costs  shrink and store occupancy costs 
any inability to obtain acceptable levels of initial markups  a significant increase in our use of markdowns or an inability to generate sufficient sales leverage on other components of cost of sales could have an adverse impact on our gross margin results and results of operations 
operating income loss we view operating income loss as a key indicator of our success 
the key drivers of operating income loss are comparable store sales  gross margins  and our ability to control operating costs 
cash flow and liquidity working capital we evaluate cash flow from operations  liquidity and working capital to determine our short term operational financing needs 
we expect that our cash on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to finance operations without borrowing under our senior revolving credit facility  or the facility  for at least the next months 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  some of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with absolute certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
we believe the application of our accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
our accounting policies and estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the policies and estimates discussed below involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies that are material to our consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we have certain accounting policies that require more significant management judgment and estimates than others 
these include our accounting policies with respect to revenue recognition  merchandise inventories  long lived assets  impairment of goodwill  stock based compensation  recovery of deferred income taxes  insurance reserves and derivative financial instruments 
revenue recognition sales are recognized upon purchase by customers at our retail store locations 
taxes collected from our customers are and have been recorded on a net basis 
for online sales  revenue is recognized at the estimated time goods are received by customers 
shipping and handling fees billed to internet customers are classified as revenue 
online customers typically receive goods within five to seven days of shipment 
we have recorded accruals to estimate sales returns by customers based on historical sales return results 
a customer generally may return merchandise within days of the original purchase date 
actual return rates have historically been within management s estimates and the accruals established 
as the accrual for merchandise returns is based on estimates  the actual returns could differ from the accrual  which could impact sales 
we recognize the sales from gift cards  gift certificates and the issuance of store credits as they are redeemed for merchandise 
prior to redemption  we maintain an unearned revenue liability for gift cards  gift 
table of contents certificates and store credits until we are released from such liability 
we have not recognized breakage on gift cards  gift certificates and store credits in our consolidated financial statements as of february  our gift cards  gift certificates and store credits do not have expiration dates 
we are in the process of analyzing our responsibility to escheat unredeemed gift cards  gift certificates and store credits to various state authorities and historical redemption patterns 
we may have changes in the estimate of our liability depending on the results of this analysis 
through our wet seal concept  we have a frequent buyer program that entitles the customer to receive a to discount on all purchases made during the month program period 
the annual membership fee of is non refundable 
we recognize membership fee revenue on a straight line basis over the month membership period due to a lack of sufficient program history to date to determine the spending pattern under the program 
upon gaining sufficient program history to assess spending patterns  we may  in the future  determine that recognition of membership fee revenue on a different basis may be appropriate 
discounts received by customers on purchases using the frequent buyer program are recognized at the time of such purchases 
we maintain a customer loyalty program at arden b 
under the program  customers accumulate points based on purchase activity 
once a loyalty program member achieves a certain point level  the member earns awards that may be redeemed at any time for merchandise 
estimated merchandise redemptions are accrued as unearned revenue and recorded as a reduction of sales as points are accumulated by the member 
during fiscal  we modified the terms of the arden b loyalty program with respect to the number of points required to earn an award and the value of awards when earned 
at the time of the program change  we also established expiration terms i for prospectively earned awards of two months from the date the award is earned and ii for pre existing awards of either two or twelve months from the program change date 
this resulted in a reduction to the company s estimate of ultimate award redemptions under the program 
as a result  we recorded a benefit of million  which was recorded as an increase to net sales and a decrease to accrued liabilities 
the unearned revenue for this program is recorded in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and was million and million at february   and january   respectively 
if actual redemptions ultimately differ from accrued redemption levels  or if we further modify the terms of the program in a way that affects expected redemption value and levels  we could record further adjustments to the unearned revenue accrual  which would affect net sales 
merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
market is determined based on the estimated net realizable value  which generally is the merchandise selling price 
cost is calculated using the retail inventory method 
under the retail inventory method  inventory is stated at its current retail selling value and then is converted to a cost basis by applying a cost to retail ratio based on beginning inventory and the fiscal year purchase activity 
the retail inventory method inherently requires management judgments and estimates  such as the amount and timing of permanent markdowns to clear unproductive or slow moving inventory  which may impact the ending inventory valuation as well as gross margins 
markdowns are recorded when the sales value of the inventory has diminished 
factors considered in the determination of permanent markdowns include current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  age of the merchandise and fashion trends 
when a decision is made to permanently mark down merchandise  the resulting gross margin reduction is recognized in the period the markdown is recorded 
total markdowns on a cost basis in fiscal  fiscal and were million  million and million  respectively  and represented   and of net sales  respectively 
we accrued on a cost basis for planned but unexecuted markdowns as of february   and january   million and million  respectively 

table of contents to the extent that management s estimates differ from actual results  additional markdowns may be required that could reduce our gross margin  operating income and the carrying value of inventories 
our success is largely dependent upon our ability to anticipate the changing fashion tastes of our customers and to respond to those changing tastes in a timely manner 
if we fail to anticipate  identify or react appropriately to changing styles  trends or brand preferences of our customers  we may experience lower sales  excess inventories and more frequent and extensive markdowns  which would adversely affect our operating results 
long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
factors that are considered important that could trigger an impairment review include a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses and a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses or insufficient income associated with the use of a long lived asset or asset group 
other factors include a significant change in the manner of the use of the asset or a significant negative industry or economic trend 
this evaluation is performed based on undiscounted estimated future cash flows from operating activities compared with the carrying value of the related assets 
if the undiscounted estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized  measured by the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the assets  with such estimated fair values determined using the best information available  generally the discounted estimated future cash flows of the assets using a rate that approximates our weighted average cost of capital 
quarterly  we assess whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that potentially indicate the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
during fiscal and fiscal  we determined such events or changes in circumstances had occurred with respect to certain of our retail stores  and that operating losses or insufficient operating income would likely continue 
as such  we recorded non cash charges of a combined total of million and million  respectively  in our consolidated statement of operations for fiscal and fiscal to write down the carrying value of these stores long lived assets to their estimated fair value 
during fiscal  we concluded that an indication of impairment existed with respect to a large number of our retail stores 
based on the results of impairment analyses  we wrote down the carrying value of certain impaired long lived assets during fiscal by million  including impairment of goodwill see below 
the impairment charges were a non cash charge to our consolidated statements of operations 
the estimation of future cash flows from operating activities requires significant estimates of factors that include future sales growth and gross margin performance 
if our sales growth  gross margin performance or other estimated operating results are not achieved at or above our forecasted level  or cost inflation exceeds our forecast and we are unable to recover such costs through price increases  the carrying value of certain of our retail stores may prove to be unrecoverable and we may incur additional impairment charges in the future 
impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we test goodwill for impairment no less frequently than annually  and also may test on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more likely than not impairment may have occurred 
the impairment  if any  is measured based on the estimated fair value of a reporting unit 
fair value can be determined based on discounted cash flows  comparable sales or valuations of other retail businesses 
impairment occurs when the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value 
the most significant assumptions we use in this analysis are those made in estimating future cash flows 
in estimating future cash flows  we use assumptions for items such as comparable store sales  store count growth 
table of contents rates  the rate of inflation and the discount rate we consider to represent our weighted average cost of capital and or the market discount rate for acquisitions of retail businesses 
if our assumptions used in performing the impairment test prove inaccurate  the fair value of our goodwill may ultimately prove to be significantly lower  thereby causing the carrying value to exceed the fair value and indicating impairment has occurred 
as of february   goodwill was million  of which the entire amount is directly associated with the arden b division 
based on the february  and january   analyses  we determined that no impairment of the company s goodwill had occurred 
however  based on the results of the january   analysis  we wrote down the carrying value of goodwill as of january   by million  which was recorded within asset impairments in the consolidated statements of operations 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  shared based payment  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
sfas no 
r supersedes our previous accounting methodology using the intrinsic value method under accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees 
under the intrinsic value method  stock based compensation associated with stock options and awards was determined as the difference  if any  between the fair market value of the related common stock on the measurement date and the price an employee must pay to exercise the award 
accordingly  stock based compensation expense had been recognized for restricted stock grants as well as for stock options that were granted at prices that were below the fair market value of the related stock at the measurement date 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective application method 
under this method  compensation expense recognized includes a compensation expense for all share based awards granted prior to  but not yet vested  as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and b compensation expense for all share based awards granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
in accordance with the modified prospective application method  our consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of sfas no 
r 
on november   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas r  transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards 
we have elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided in fas r for calculating the tax effects of share based compensation pursuant to sfas r 
the alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool apic pool related to the tax effects of employee share based compensation  and to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax effects of employee and director share based awards that are outstanding upon adoption of sfas no 
r 
we also apply the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in connection with selling  goods and services  and eitf issue no 
 accounting recognition for certain transactions involving equity instruments granted to other than employees for stock based compensation to other than employees 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to value stock options granted to employees 
we use these values to recognize stock compensation expense for stock options in accordance with sfas no 
r 
the black scholes model is complex and requires significant exercise of judgment to estimate future common stock dividend yield  common stock expected volatility  and the expected life of the stock options 
these assumptions significantly affect our stock option valuations  and future changes in these 
table of contents assumptions could significantly change valuations of future stock option grants and  thus  affect future stock compensation expense 
in addition  if circumstances were to change such that we determined stock options values were better represented by an alternative valuation method  such change could also significantly affect future stock compensation expense 
we also apply the black scholes and monte carlo simulation models to value performance shares granted to employees and consultants 
use of the black scholes model for this purpose requires the same exercise of judgment noted above 
the monte carlo simulation model is also complex and requires significant exercise of judgment to estimate expected returns on our common stock  expected common stock volatility and our maximum expected share value during applicable vesting periods 
this valuation approach also requires us to estimate a marketability discount in consideration of trading restrictions on performance share grants 
we currently believe monte carlo simulation provides the most relevant value of performance share grants as the simulation allows for vesting throughout the vesting period and includes an assumption for equity returns over time  while the black scholes method does not 
as the monte carlo simulation provides a more precise estimate of fair value  we have used that approach to value our performance shares for accounting purposes 
the assumptions we use to value our performance shares significantly affect the resulting values used for accounting purposes 
accordingly  changes in these assumptions could significantly change valuations and  thus  affect future stock compensation expense 
in addition  if circumstances were to change such that we determined performance share values were better represented by the black scholes model or an alternative valuation method  and such changes resulted in a significant change in the value of performance shares  such changes could also significantly affect future stock compensation 
recovery of deferred income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized 
as a result of disappointing sales results during the back to school season and our historical operating performance  management concluded during fiscal that it was more likely than not that we would not realize our net deferred tax assets 
as a result of this conclusion  we reduced to zero our net deferred tax assets by establishing a tax valuation allowance of million in fiscal in addition  we have discontinued recognizing income tax benefits in the consolidated statements of operations until it is determined that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets 
as of february   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of million  which begin to expire in section of the internal revenue code  or section  contains provisions that may limit the availability of net operating loss carryforwards to be used to offset taxable income in any given year upon the occurrence of certain events  including significant changes in ownership interests 
under section  an ownership change that triggers potential limitations on net operating loss carryforwards occurs when there has been a greater than change in ownership interest by shareholders owning or more of a company over a period of three years or less 
based on our analysis  we had an ownership change on april   which results in section limitations applying to federal net operating loss carryforwards generated prior to that date  which were approximately million 
we estimate we will have approximately million of this pre ownership change federal net operating loss carryforward available within five years after the ownership change  at a rate of approximately million annually  with the remaining net operating loss carryforward of million becoming available prior to expiration between and of the million  we used approximately million in fiscal  leaving million of the pre ownership change federal net operating loss carryforward still available as of february  however  if future taxable income were to exceed the sum of i the applicable annual loss limitation  ii carryforwards of prior years unutilized losses  if any  and iii carryforwards of post ownership change losses  if any  in any given fiscal year  then we would be required to pay federal and state income taxes on the excess amount in such fiscal year 

table of contents we estimate we will have approximately million of federal net operating loss carryforwards available to offset taxable income in fiscal however  we may also generate income in fiscal and or future periods on a federal alternative minimum tax basis  which would result in alternative minimum taxes payable  of which only may be offset by alternative minimum tax net operating loss carryforwards 
in addition  we may determine that varying state laws with respect to net operating loss carryforward utilization may result in lower limits  or an inability to utilize loss carryforwards in some states altogether  which could result in our incurring additional state income taxes 
insurance reserves we are partially self insured for our worker s compensation and group health plans 
under the workers compensation insurance program  we are liable for a deductible of million for each individual claim and an aggregate annual liability of million 
under our group health plan  we are liable for a deductible of million for each claim and an aggregate monthly liability of million 
the monthly aggregate liability is subject to adjustment based on the number of participants in the plan each month 
for both of the insurance plans  we record a liability for the costs associated with reported claims and a projected estimate for unreported claims considering historical experience and industry standards 
we will continue to adjust the estimates as the actual experience dictates 
a significant change in the number or dollar amount of claims could cause us to revise our estimate of potential losses and affect our reported results 
derivative financial instruments we account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires that all derivative financial instruments be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
as of february   our only derivative financial instrument was an embedded derivative associated with our secured convertible notes 
the gain or loss as a result of the change in fair value of this embedded derivative is recognized in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations each period 
we apply the black scholes and monte carlo simulation models to value this embedded derivative 
in applying the black scholes and monte carlo simulation models  changes and volatility in our common stock price  and changes in risk free interest rates  our expected dividend yield and expected returns on our common stock could significantly affect the fair value of this derivative instrument  which could then result in significant charges or credits to interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
we have determined that value is best represented by a blend of valuation outcomes under black scholes modeling and monte carlo simulation 
in addition to the estimate changes noted above  if circumstances were to change such that we determined that the embedded derivative value was better represented by an alternative valuation method  and such changes resulted in a significant change in the value of the embedded derivative  such changes could also significantly affect future interest expense 
current trends and outlook in december  we initiated a new strategy for our wet seal stores  which  among other things  consisted of closure of approximately under performing wet seal stores  lower retail prices  a broader assortment of fashion right merchandise and more frequent delivery of fresh merchandise 
with the introduction of this strategy  we experienced consolidated comparable store sales growth of in fiscal during fiscal  we built upon the turnaround that started in fiscal  with further comparable sales growth of 
during fiscal  we also increased transaction counts per store and the number of items purchased per customer  which were partially offset by a decrease in average unit retail in comparison to the prior year 
during the four weeks ended march   and the five weeks ended april   we continued the positive sales trend with increases of and in comparable store sales  respectively 

table of contents our long term strategy is to expand our existing retail store base  take advantage of our compelling store economics  continue our trend of positive comparable store sales growth  revive the arden b business and expand our online business 
we are also taking several steps to drive higher sales productivity in our retail stores  including improved store layout and visual displays  and have embarked on several initiatives to improve gross margins  including efforts to increase direct foreign sourcing of merchandise  rationalize our vendor base and improve supply chain efficiency through better synergies among and within our vendor  internal distribution and store operations organizations 
our current operating performance trend and financing transactions completed in fiscal and have resulted in increased liquidity and  in turn  improved our current credit standing with suppliers  which may further improve our liquidity 
however  we may experience future declines in comparable store sales or may be unsuccessful in executing some or all of our business strategy 
if our comparable store sales drop significantly or we falter in execution of our business strategy  we may not achieve our financial performance goals  which could impact our results of operations and operating cash flow  and we may be forced to seek alternatives to address cash constraints  including seeking additional debt and or equity financing 
store openings and closures during fiscal  we opened wet seal and four arden b stores and closed four wet seal and four arden b stores 
we believe future closures for at least the next months will primarily result from lease expirations where we decide not to extend  or are unable to extend  a store lease 
we expect to open to new wet seal and or arden b stores  net of closings  during fiscal credit extensions due to our financial results through fiscal  we experienced a tight credit environment 
credit extended to us by vendors  factors  and others for merchandise and services was extremely limited 
this credit tightening required us to issue letters of credit outside of the ordinary course of business  or  in many instances  shorten vendor credit terms 
the lack of credit created a considerable need for working capital 
our improving sales trend  the completion of financing transactions in fiscal and  and our improved operating results in fiscal and fiscal have significantly improved our cash position and liquidity profile 
as a result  we achieved improvements in credit terms with several vendors in fiscal  and we believe  but cannot provide assurance  that we could now obtain longer credit terms with additional vendors 
however  we continue to maintain shorter credit terms in order to take advantage of favorable purchase discounts 
merchandising consultant beginning in late  a consultant assisted our company with merchandising initiatives for our wet seal concept 
on july   we entered into a consulting agreement and an associated stock award agreement with the consultant that expired on january  under the terms of the consulting agreement  we paid the consultant million upon agreement execution and million per month from july through january we recorded million and million of consulting expense within selling  general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations during fiscal and fiscal  respectively  to recognize this cash compensation 
since the term of the consulting agreement ended in fiscal  we will not incur any further cash compensation expense under this arrangement in future periods 
under the terms of the stock award agreement  we awarded the consultant million shares of non forfeitable restricted stock  for which we recognized million of stock compensation expense during the second quarter of fiscal we also awarded two tranches of million performance shares  under the stock 
table of contents award agreement  or the performance shares 
the performance shares vest upon our achievement of certain common stock market price levels on or before january   as specified in the stock award agreement 
the second tranche of performance shares may also vest upon our achievement of certain sales and gross margin levels on or before january   also as specified in the stock award agreement  however  we believe the achievement of vesting through reaching the specified common stock market price levels is significantly more likely than achievement of vesting through achieving the specified sales and gross margin targets 
during fiscal  the entire first tranche of the performance shares and one of the five  share sub tranches of the second tranche of the performance shares had vested due to our achievement of the specified common stock market price levels pertaining thereto 
as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we recorded a charge of million of non cash consulting expense within selling  general and administrative expenses during fiscal  based on the vesting of a portion of the performance shares  the consulting agreement period elapsed and the fair value of the remaining unvested performance shares  which included consideration of vesting probability for the second tranche as of the end of fiscal given the completion of the consulting agreement term as of the end of fiscal  in fiscal and beyond we will incur no additional consulting expense or credit with respect to the performance shares  regardless of the eventual vesting or non vesting of the million non vested shares remaining as of february  stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
the adoption of sfas no 
r resulted in the recognition of incremental compensation expense of million related to stock options and million related to employee performance shares during fiscal the following table summarizes stock based compensation recorded in the consolidated statements of operations  including the expense for the performance shares granted to the merchandising consultant as discussed above in thousands february  january  january  cost of sales selling  general and administrative expenses stock based compensation results of operations except as otherwise noted  the following discussion of our financial position and results of operations excludes our discontinued zutopia concept  which was closed by may

cost of sales increased in dollars primarily due to the increase in net sales 
cost of sales decreased as a percent to net sales  due to modification of the terms of our arden b customer loyalty program to expire unredeemed awards after a specified period of time  resulting in recognition of sales previously deferred of million with no corresponding charge to cost of sales  improvement in merchandise margin due to increases in cumulative markup rates and increased amortization of frequent buyer program revenues  partially offset by increased markdowns for discounts associated with the frequent buyer program  increased markdowns in connection with the transition of merchandise leadership within the arden b concept  and additional markdowns at wet seal stores due to relatively weak sales performance in the fourth quarter  and the positive effect of sales leverage on occupancy costs 
however  the decrease was partially offset by the following an increase in buying  planning and allocation payroll and related costs due to higher staffing levels and million in stock compensation expense resulting from our adoption of sfas r as of the beginning of fiscal  and an increase in distribution costs associated with transferring security tagging activity from our stores to our distribution center  an increase in inventory receipts and million in stock compensation expense resulting from our adoption of sfas r as of the beginning of fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses sg a change from prior fiscal year in millions selling  general and administrative expenses percent of net sales our sg a expenses are comprised of two components

selling expenses increased approximately million over the prior year 
as a percentage of net sales  selling expenses were of net sales  or points higher as a percentage of net sales  than a year ago 
the increase in selling expenses from last year  in dollars  was primarily due to a million increase in payroll and 
table of contents benefits costs as a result of increased sales  labor intensive store promotion set ups  heavy inventory receipts and our increase in store count  partially offset by transfer of security tagging activity from our stores to our distribution center during fiscal  a million increase in internet production and ordering costs due to higher internet sales compared to the prior year  a million increase in spending for advertising associated with visual presentation  in store signage  promotional contests and publication placements  a million increase in store supply costs  a million increase in credit card and other banking fees  a million increase in security costs due to increased purchases of inventory sensor tags  a million increase in store related travel and field support costs  and a million increase in inventory services due to our increased number of stores and higher inventory levels 
general and administrative expenses decreased approximately million from the prior year to million 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses were  or points lower  than a year ago 
the following contributed to the current year decrease in general and administrative expenses a decrease in charges associated with the july merchandise consultant agreement of million  which resulted from prior year stock and cash compensation charges of million and million  respectively  versus only million and million of such charges  respectively  in the current year  and a million decrease in legal fees  due primarily to a decrease in the amount of legal charges associated with shareholder class action litigation initiated in mid fiscal and an sec investigation initiated in early fiscal however  the decrease in general and administrative expenses was partially offset by the following increases million in non cash stock compensation expense for employee stock options and performance shares primarily as a result of our adoption of sfas no

table of contents provision for income taxes change from prior fiscal year in millions provision for income taxes we ceased recognizing tax benefits related to our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets beginning with our second quarter of fiscal  and we currently recognize the tax benefits associated with our deferred tax assets only when they are realized 
due primarily to the non deductibility for tax purposes of the interest expense associated with our secured convertible notes  we generated taxable income in fiscal despite our loss before provision for income taxes 
we had sufficient net operating loss carryforwards available to fully offset our taxable income for fiscal  however  under federal tax law  we are permitted to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset only of our taxable income  as calculated on the alternative minimum tax basis 
as such  our remaining of income  as calculated on the alternative minimum tax basis  is subject to federal income taxes payable at a rate of 
our fiscal provision for income taxes is primarily comprised of this alternative minimum tax 
during fiscal  we incurred a provision for income taxes of million to write off certain state tax receivables we no longer believe to be realizable 
accretion of non cash dividends on convertible preferred stock during fiscal  we issued  shares of our series c convertible preferred stock  with a stated value of million 
we initially recorded this preferred stock at a discount of million

fiscal compared to fiscal net sales change from prior fiscal year in millions net sales comparable store sales net sales in fiscal increased as a result of significant growth in comparable store sales 
comparable store sales increased as a result of an increase in transaction count per store  partially offset by a decrease in average dollar sale driven substantially all by a decrease in our average unit retail  which resulted from our change in merchandising strategy in our wet seal stores 
the net sales growth from increased comparable store sales was partially offset by having a lower average number of stores in operation during fiscal than in fiscal this decrease primarily resulted from closing wet seal stores during the period from december through january and wet seal stores from february through early march pursuant to the wet seal turn around strategy 
the fewer stores in operation during fiscal versus fiscal was also affected by closure of stores primarily from february through september of fiscal and closure of an additional stores from late march through the end of fiscal the lower average number of stores in operation was partially offset by openings of stores during fiscal followed by openings of stores during fiscal  which included re openings of previously closed wet seal stores

cost of sales  in dollars and as a percent to net sales  decreased due to the positive effect of higher average store sales on design  buying  planning and allocation and occupancy costs  significantly lower markdown volume due primarily to benefits from the new merchandising approach in our wet seal stores  and the volume impact of having a lower average number of stores open in fiscal versus fiscal due mainly to the effect of the wet seal turn around strategy that included closing of stores in late and early selling  general and administrative expenses sg a change from prior fiscal year in millions selling  general and administrative expenses percent of net sales selling expenses decreased million to of net sales  or points as a percentage of net sales  from a year ago 
the decrease in store operating expenses from last year  in dollars  was primarily due to having a lower average number of stores open in fiscal versus fiscal due mainly to the effect of the wet seal turn around strategy  which resulted in an million decrease in store and field operations payroll and benefit costs  and a million decrease in spending for advertising  which included the discontinuance of our wet seal in store fashion and entertainment network  partially offset by increases of million for merchandise delivery  million for bags and boxes and million for store supplies as a result of our significant transaction count increase  and an increase of million in credit card fees due to our sales growth 
the decrease in selling expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to efficiencies resulting from changes in our store staffing model and the leverage benefits on store labor from the comparable store sales increases in ongoing stores  partially offset by the increases in store supplies  bag and box and merchandise delivery costs  which exceeded our net sales growth rate 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately million over last year to million 
general and administrative expenses were  or points higher  as a percentage of net sales  than a year ago 
the following contributed to the current year increase in general and administrative expenses million in cash charges and million in non cash stock compensation charges incurred under the terms of the consulting and stock award agreements we executed with a merchandising consultant in july  an increase in board of director fees of million  primarily associated with non cash stock compensation  and an increase of million of provisions for estimated costs of state sales and use tax audits 

table of contents however  the increase in general and administrative expenses was partially offset by the following decreases a million charge for consulting expenses in the prior year associated with our assessment of strategic alternatives  a million decrease in salaries  wages  bonuses and benefits primarily due to lower head count and the incurrence of million of employee retention bonuses in the prior year  partially offset by a million increase in performance bonuses due to our significantly improved financial performance in the current year  a million decrease in computer maintenance costs  a million decrease in fees incurred for the audits of our consolidated financial statements and of our internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with the sarbanes oxley act of  and a million decrease in severance charges  due to million in severance charges in the prior year related to the resignation of our former ceo and our former wet seal division president  which was partially offset by million in severance charges in the current year related to the resignation of the company s former cfo  an executive vice president and certain other employees 
store closure costs change from prior fiscal year in millions store closure costs percent of net sales in december  we announced that we would close approximately wet seal stores as part of our turn around strategy 
we completed our inventory liquidation sales and closing of wet seal stores by early march subsequently  we closed eight additional wet seal stores due to their poor performance 
we took charges of million related to the estimated lease termination costs for the store closures that occurred through early march and related liquidation fees and expenses  partially offset by a benefit related to the write off of deferred rent associated with these stores 
we have completed our previously announced store closure effort and related lease terminations 
with respect to fiscal  of the stores that were part of our wet seal turn around strategy  we had ceased use of property at wet seal stores on or about january   and took a charge of approximately million for the estimated cost of lease buyouts and other related costs 
in addition  for all the stores we identified for closure  we took a charge of approximately million for the write down of the carrying value of the store assets primarily leasehold improvements to realizable value 
in addition  we recognized a benefit of approximately million related to the write off of deferred rent associated with these stores 
asset impairment change from prior fiscal year in millions asset impairment percent of net sales based on our quarterly assessments of the carrying value of long lived assets  in fiscal  we identified seven stores with carrying values of their assets  including leasehold improvements  furniture  fixtures and equipment  in excess of such stores respective forecasted undiscounted cash flows

table of contents their respective carrying values to their estimated fair market values 
we incurred non cash charges of million to write down these stores to their respective fair values  as well as to write down the value of certain capital additions made to previously impaired stores 
during fiscal  we recorded impairment charges of million  including impairment of goodwill  on certain long lived assets  primarily as a result of disappointing sales results for the back to school period  our expectations at that time for operating results for the balance of fiscal and recent historical results 
interest expense  net change from prior fiscal year in millions interest expense  net percent of net sales we incurred interest expense  net  of million in fiscal comprised of interest expense of million under our senior credit facility  or the facility  for our million term loan  which bears interest at prime plus  plus our senior credit facility  appraisal and amendment fees

in fiscal  we incurred net interest expense of million  comprised of million associated with our senior credit facility and the term loan thereunder  million of interest expense on our million bridge loan  million of interest on our notes issued shortly before that fiscal year end and million of deferred financing cost amortization  partially offset by million of interest income on investments 
provision for income taxes change from prior fiscal year in millions provision for income taxes as discussed further below  we ceased recognizing tax benefits related to our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets beginning with our second quarter of fiscal we also did not recognize income tax 
table of contents benefits related to net operating losses generated in fiscal during fiscal  we incurred a provision for income taxes of million primarily to write off certain state tax receivables we no longer believe to be realizable 
in fiscal  we incurred a benefit for current income taxes of million and a provision for deferred income taxes of million 
the provision for deferred income taxes was comprised of the establishment of a tax valuation allowance of million against all of our deferred tax assets  partially offset by a benefit to income taxes of million recognized prior to our decision in to cease recognizing such benefits 
the tax valuation allowance was deemed necessary in light of disappointing sales results  our expectations at that time for weak future operating results and our historical operating performance 
we established this tax valuation allowance in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires deferred tax assets to be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future

we immediately accreted this discount in its entirety in the form of a non cash dividend on preferred stock since the preferred stock is immediately convertible and has no stated redemption date 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal  compared to million for the same period last year 
for fiscal  operating cash flows were directly impacted by net non cash charges primarily stock compensation expense  depreciation and amortization  and amortization of debt discount and deferred financing costs of million  partially offset by our net loss of million  an increase in merchandise inventories  net of merchandise accounts payable of million due to our increased store count  an increase in average inventory per store  and a decrease in merchandise accounts payable versus a year ago due to variances in the timing of inventory receipts near year end  and a use of cash from changes in other operating assets and liabilities of million due primarily to our payment of february store rents prior to the end of fiscal for fiscal  net cash used in investing activities of million was comprised primarily of capital expenditures 
capital expenditures for the period were primarily for new stores and store relocations and remodeling for our wet seal concept and for various information technology projects 
capital expenditures do not include million in capital assets purchased on account for which we have not yet made payment  which is million higher than the similar balance as of the end of fiscal due to increase capital expenditure activity in late fiscal we expect such payments will be made primarily during the first quarter of fiscal we estimate that  in fiscal  capital expenditures will be approximately million  primarily for the construction of to new stores  remodeling or relocation of existing stores and various other store related capital projects 
we anticipate receiving approximately million in landlord tenant improvement allowances in connection with certain of our new store lease agreements 
for fiscal  net cash used in financing activities was million  comprised primarily of the repayment of our million term loan and common stock repurchases for a cost of million  partially offset by million in proceeds from investor exercises of common stock warrants 
on march   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of the outstanding shares of our class a common stock 
repurchases are at our option and can be discontinued at any time 

table of contents total cash and cash equivalents at february   was million  compared to million at january  our working capital at february   increased to million from million at january   due primarily to our increase in cash  merchandise inventories and prepaid expenses  especially prepaid rents  and our decrease in accounts payable  partially offset by our increase in accrued liabilities during fiscal we previously maintained a million senior revolving credit facility the facility  which was scheduled to mature in may on august   we replaced the facility with an amended and restated credit agreement the restated credit agreement to provide for a senior revolving credit facility of million  which can be increased up to million in the absence of any default and upon the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent specified in the restated credit agreement 
in addition to extending the current agreement term from may to may  the restated credit agreement provides us  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent  with the ability to make certain levels of investments  acquisitions and common stock repurchases without lender consent  and reduces our letter of credit and other facility fees 
under the restated credit agreement  we are subject to borrowing base limitations on the amount that can be borrowed and certain customary covenants  including covenants limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness  make investments and acquisitions  grant liens  pay dividends  close stores and dispose of assets  subject to certain exceptions 
our ability to borrow and request the issuance of letters of credit is subject to the requirement that we maintain an excess of the borrowing base over the outstanding credit extensions of not less than million 
the interest rate on the revolving line of credit under the restated credit agreement is the prime rate or  if we elect  the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin ranging from to 
the applicable libor margin is based on the level of average excess availability  as defined under the restated credit agreement  at the time of election  as adjusted quarterly 
the applicable libor margin was as of february  we also incur fees on outstanding letters of credit under the restated credit agreement in effect at a rate equal to the applicable libor margin for standby letters of credit and of the applicable libor margin for commercial letters of credit 
the restated credit agreement ranks senior in right of payment to our secured convertible notes 
borrowings under the restated credit agreement are secured by all of our presently owned and hereafter acquired assets 
our obligations thereunder are guaranteed by one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  wet seal gc  inc at february   the amount outstanding under the restated credit agreement consisted of million in open documentary letters of credit related to merchandise purchases and million in standby letters of credit 
at february   we had million available for cash advances and or for the issuance of additional letters of credit 
at february   we were in compliance with all covenant requirements in the restated credit agreement 
we believe we will have sufficient cash and credit availability to meet our operating and capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  we may experience future declines in comparable store sales or experience other events that negatively affect our operating results 
such decline could result in a reduction in our operating cash flows and a decrease in or elimination of excess availability under our restated credit agreement  which could force us to seek alternatives to address our cash constraints  including seeking additional debt and or equity financing 
seasonality and inflation our business is seasonal in nature  with the christmas season  beginning the week of thanksgiving and ending the first saturday after christmas  and the back to school season  beginning the last week of july and ending in mid september  historically accounting for a large percentage of our sales volume 
for the past three fiscal years  the christmas and back to school seasons together accounted for an average of slightly more than of our annual sales 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations during the past three years 
however  we cannot be certain that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future

new accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position no 
 accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period fas  which requires rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases that are incurred during a construction period to 
table of contents be recognized as rental expense 
fas was effective for periods beginning after december  we adopted this pronouncement at the beginning of fiscal the adoption of fas did not affect our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin requires that a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
a recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
upon adoption  the cumulative effect of applying the recognition and measurement provisions of fin  if any  shall be reflected as an adjustment to the opening balance of our accumulated deficit 
fin requires that  subsequent to initial adoption  a change in judgment that results in subsequent recognition  derecognition or change in a measurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period including any related interest and penalties be recognized as a discrete item in the period in which the change occurs 
fin also requires expanded disclosures  including identification of tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change in the next months  a description of tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdiction  a tabular reconciliation of the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at the beginning and end of each annual reporting period  the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would affect the effective tax rate and the total amounts of interest and penalties recognized in the statements of operations and financial position 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   for us the fiscal year beginning february  we have not yet determined what impact the adoption of fin will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

sfas no 
provides a new single authoritative definition of fair value and provides enhanced guidance for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities and requires additional disclosures related to the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
we will be required to adopt sfas no 
effective for the fiscal year beginning february  we have not yet determined what impact the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r  sfas no 

sfas no 
requires recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan other than a multiemployer plan as an asset or liability in our statement of financial position and recognition of changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income of a business entity 
this statement also requires us to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of our year end statement of financial position 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years ending after december   except for the measurement date provisions  which are effective for fiscal years ending after december  our adoption of sfas no 
resulted in a reduction of million in our liability related to our serp and an increase of million in our accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet as of february  in september  the securities and exchange commission  or sec  issued staff accounting bulletin  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provides guidance on the consideration of effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment 
the sec staff believes registrants must quantify errors using both a balance sheet and income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
sab was effective for the first annual period ending after november   with early application encouraged 
the adoption of sab did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas no 
provides companies with an option to report many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
the objective of sfas no 
is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
the fasb believes that sfas no 
helps to mitigate accounting induced volatility by enabling companies to report related assets and liabilities at fair value  which would likely reduce the need for companies to comply with detailed rules for hedge accounting 
sfas no 
also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities  and would require entities to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet 
the new statement does not eliminate disclosure requirements included in other accounting standards  including requirements for disclosures about fair value measurements included in sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year beginning after november  we are in the process of evaluating the impact  if any  that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb ratified the consensus reached on emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation 
the eitf reached a consensus that the presentation of taxes on either a gross or net basis is an accounting policy decision that requires disclosure 
eitf issue no 
is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after december  taxes collected from our customers are and have been recorded on a net basis 
we have no intention of modifying this accounting policy 
as such  the adoption of eitf issue no 
will not have an effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
additional information regarding new accounting pronouncements is contained in note of notes to consolidated financial statements herein 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk to the extent that we borrow under our senior credit facility  we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
at february   no borrowings were outstanding under the restated credit agreement 
as of february   we are not a party to any derivative financial instruments  except as discussed in market risk change in value of our common stock immediately below 
we contract for and settle all purchases in us dollars  and in fiscal we directly imported less than of our merchandise inventories 
thus  we consider the effect of currency rate changes to be indirect and  given the small amount of imported product  we believe the effect of a major shift in currency exchange rates would be insignificant to our results 
market risk change in value of our common stock our secured convertible notes see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contain an embedded derivative  which upon the occurrence of a change of control  as defined  allows each note holder the option to require us to redeem all or a portion of the notes at a price equal to the greater of i the product of x the conversion amount being redeemed and y the quotient determined by dividing a the closing sale price of our class a common stock on the business day on which the first public announcement of such proposed change of control is made by b the conversion price and ii of the conversion amount being redeemed 
we account for this derivative at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets within other long term liabilities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we determine the fair value of the derivative instrument each period using a combination of the black scholes model and the monte carlo simulation model 
such models are complex and require significant judgments in the estimation of 
table of contents fair values in the absence of quoted market prices 
changes in the fair market value of the derivative liability are recognized in earnings 
in applying the black scholes and monte carlo simulation models  changes and volatility in our common stock price  and changes in risk free interest rates  our expected dividend yield and expected returns on our common stock could significantly affect the fair value of this derivative instrument  which could then result in significant charges or credits to interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
during fiscal  there was a million decrease in the fair value of this derivative  which we recognized as a decrease to the carrying value of the derivative liability and a reduction of interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations
