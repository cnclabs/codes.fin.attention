our corporate headquarters are located at west first street  sanford  florida and our telephone number is the primary source of our revenues on an unconsolidated basis is earnings of the bank and the mortgage company 
various regulatory restrictions and tax considerations limit  directly or indirectly  the amount of dividends the bank can pay to federal trust 
in addition  federal law restricts the bank in the making of investments in or loans to us or our affiliates

like other financial institutions  we must ensure that sufficient funds are available to meet deposit withdrawals  loan commitments  investment needs and expenses 
control of our cash flow requires the anticipation of deposit flows and loan payments 
our primary sources of funds are deposit accounts  fhlb advances and principal and interest payments on loans and investments 
we require funds in the short term to finance ongoing operating expenses  pay liquidating deposits  invest in loans and purchase investment securities 
we fund short term requirements through advances from the fhlb  deposit growth  the sale of investments  and loan principal payments 
long term funds are required to invest in loans for our portfolio  purchase fixed assets and provide for the liquidation of deposits maturing in the future 
long term funding requirements are obtained from principal payments from maturing loans  the sale of loans and the sale of investments 
management has no plans to significantly change long term funding requirements

results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and general 
the company had net earnings for of million or 
per basic share and 
per diluted share compared to net earnings of million or 
per basic and 
per diluted share for the decrease in the net earnings in was due to increases in employee compensation and benefits and occupancy expense relating to our three new branches and the staffing of our mortgage company  together with decreases in net gains from sales of loans and securities available for sale  partially offset by an increase in net interest income 
interest income 
interest income was million in compared to million in interest income on loans increased to million in from million in the increase in interest income on loans in is attributable primarily to an increase in the yield earned on the loans outstanding during the year and to a lesser extent by an increase in the average amount of loans outstanding 
interest income on securities increased to million in from million in as a result of an increase in the average balance of securities held by the company and an increase in the yield earned on the securities 
other interest income increased from  in to  during management expects the yield earned on the portfolios to fluctuate with general market interest rate movements 
interest expense 
interest expense increased during to million compared to million in  due to an increase in the average amount of deposit accounts and borrowings outstanding and an increase in the average rate paid 
interest expense on deposits increased by million in as a result of an increase in the average amount of deposits and an increase in average rate paid on deposits 
interest expense on these accounts will increase or decrease according to the general level of interest rates 
interest on borrowings increased to million in from million in due to an increase in the average rate paid on borrowings outstanding  offset by a small decrease in the average amount of borrowings 
management expects to continue to use fhlb advances and other borrowings when the rates offered on such funds is favorable when compared to the rates paid on deposits in the local market 
provisions for loan losses 
a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings based upon our evaluation of the inherent losses in the loan portfolio

total loans declined by million  or in of this amount  million were residential mortgage loans  million in residential construction loans  million in land development and construction loans  all offset by an increase of million in non residential estate loans 
as of december   of our loan portfolio was in residential mortgage loans  which historically have had the lowest risk of loss in the overall portfolio  and as a result have had a lower reserve percentage applied to them based on historical loss percentages 
total charge offs were  in compared to recoveries of  on loans previously charged off 
for  total charge offs and recoveries were  and  respectively 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  or 
of year end loans net  compared to million or 
of net loans at december  total non accrual loans at december   increased to million compared to million at december  the amount needed in the allowance for loan losses for nonaccrual loans is based on the particular circumstances of the individual loans  including the type  amount  and value of the collateral  if any  and the overall composition and amount of the performing loans in the portfolio at the time of evaluation  and  as a result  will vary over time 
other income 
other income decreased  to million for the year ended december  this decline was primarily the result of declines in gains on sales of loans and securities of  and other of  which includes a decline in prepayment loan fees of  loan servicing fee income of  and gains on dispositions of foreclosed assets of  offset by an increase in service charges and fees of  other expense 
other expense increased million or to million for the twelve month period ended december   from million for the same period in salary and employee benefits increased million and occupancy expense increased  primarily due to the staffing and opening of the branches in lake mary in january  port orange in july  eustis in october  increases in the lending staff  and the overall growth of the company 
specifically  the three new branches that opened this year have added approximately  to our overhead expenses 
while our branch expansion plan will enhance franchise value  their positive effect on earnings will not be felt until the branches have been given an opportunity to mature and reach their respective efficiency levels 
professional expenses increased  primarily as a result of the proxy contest and lawsuit filed by keefe managers  llc  regarding the election of directors at the annual meeting of shareholders 
in addition  other volume and growth related expense increases included data processing expense of  marketing and advertising of  printing and stationary of  and  in telephone expense

for  net earnings were million or 
per basic share and 
per diluted share compared to net earnings of million or 
per basic and 
per diluted share for the improvement in the net earnings in was due to the non cash  other than temporary impairment charge of approximately  recorded in december  together with the increases in net interest income and other income in  partially offset by an increase in other expenses 
the other than temporary impairment charge related to the bank s million investment in freddie mac and fannie mae adjustable rate preferred stock 
these investment grade securities declined in value in due to the events at the government sponsored enterprises gse s coupled with the record low interest rates  which caused the dividend payment rate to decline from the original rates at the time of issuance 
the other than temporary impairment charge was recorded in since we were unable to determine at that time when and how much the preferred stock prices would recover 
excluding the  after tax effect of the charge  net earnings for would have been million  or 
and 
per basic and fully diluted share  respectively

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management it is our objective to manage assets and liabilities to provide a satisfactory  consistent level of profitability within the framework of established cash  loan  investment  borrowing and capital policies 
management is responsible for monitoring policies and procedures that are designed to ensure acceptable composition of the asset liability mix  stability and leverage of all sources of funds while adhering to prudent banking practices 
it is the overall philosophy of management to support asset growth through fhlb advances  borrowings  and most importantly  core deposits  which include deposits of all categories made by individuals  partnerships and corporations 
management seeks to invest the largest portion of its assets in residential  commercial  and consumer loans 
the asset liability mix is monitored on a monthly basis and a report reflecting interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities is prepared and presented to the bank s board of directors 
the objective of this policy is to control interest sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize the impact of substantial movements in interest rates on our earnings 
our profitability  like that of most bank holding companies and financial institutions  is dependent to a large extent upon its net interest income  which is the difference between our interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities  and our interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and other borrowings 
financial institutions are affected by general changes in levels of interest rates and other economic factors beyond their control 
at december   our cumulative  one year interest sensitivity gap the difference between the amount of interest earning assets anticipated to mature or reprice within one year and the amount of interest bearing liabilities anticipated to mature or reprice within one year as a percentage of total assets was a negative  while our three month gap was virtually matched with million assets and million in liabilities scheduled or eligible for repricing 
generally  an institution with a negative gap would experience a decrease in net interest income in a period of rising interest rates or an increase in net interest income in a period of declining interest rates since there will be more liabilities than assets that will either mature or be subject to repricing within that period 
however  certain shortcomings are inherent in this rate sensitivity analysis 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different manners to changes in market interest rates 
therefore  no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain our net interest rate spread as market interest rates fluctuate 
we monitor our interest rate risk through the asset liability committee which meets regularly and reports the results of the meetings to the board of directors 
our policy is to seek to maintain a balance between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities so that the cumulative one year gap is within a range established by the board of directors and which we believe is conducive to maintaining profitability without incurring undue risk 
our virtually matched three month cumulative gap position at the end of  will help reduce the negative impact of changes in interest rates in the first half of the following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   that are expected to reprice  based upon certain assumptions and contractual maturities  in each of the future periods shown 
adjustable rate mortgage backed securities are scheduled according to their next adjustment date  fixed rate mortgage backed securities are scheduled according to their maturity date  and equity securities are scheduled according to the date of their next dividend announcement in thousands three months or less more than three months to six months more than six months to months more than one year to years more than three years to years more than five years to years more than ten years total rate sensitive assets residential lending commercial and consumer lending mortgage backed securities debt securities corporate equity securities trust preferred securities fhlb stock interest earning deposits total interest earning assets rate sensitive liabilities deposits demand  money market and savings accounts time deposits fhlb advances other borrowings total interest bearing liabilities interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest earning assets cumulative interest bearing liabilities cumulative interest sensitivity gap as a percentage of total assets cumulative interest earning assets as a percentage of cumulative interest bearing liabilities market risk management our market risk is the risk of loss of interest and principal that may result from changes in market prices and rates 
a simple interest rate gap analysis by itself may not be an accurate indicator of how net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates 
because gap analysis may not adequately address the interest rate risk  we also use simulation models to analyze net income sensitivity to movements in interest rates 
the measurement of market risk associated with financial instruments is meaningful only when related offsetting on and off balance sheet transactions are aggregated  and the resulting net positions are identified 
accordingly  while the alco relies primarily on its asset liability structure to control interest rate risk  a sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact our earnings to the extent that the interest rates of our assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
the alco also evaluates how the repayment of particular assets and liabilities is impacted by changes in interest rates 
income associated with interest earning assets and costs associated with interest bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates 
in addition  the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates 
in addition  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features generally referred to as interest rate caps that limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the interest rate gap 
the ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
economic value of equity 
we measure the impact of market interest rate changes on the net present value of estimated cash flows from our assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items  defined as economic value of equity  using simulation models 
these simulations assess the changes in the market value of interest rate sensitive financial instruments that would occur in response to an instantaneous and sustained increase or decrease shock in market interest rates 
at december   our economic value of equity exposure related to those hypothetical changes in market interest rates was within our current guidelines 
the following table shows our projected change in economic value of equity for this set of rate shock at december  in thousands 
interest rate scenario economic value percentage change from base percentage of total assets percentage of equity book value up basis points up basis points base down basis points down basis points the computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  asset prepayments and deposit decay  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions we may undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
actual amounts may differ from the projections set forth above should market conditions vary from the underlying assumptions 
net interest income simulation 
in order to measure interest rate risk at december   we used simulation models to project changes in net interest income that result from forecasted changes in interest rates 
this analysis calculates the difference between net interest income forecasted using rising and falling interest rate scenarios and a net interest income using a base market interest rate derived from the current treasury yield curve 
the income simulation models include various assumptions regarding the repricing relationship for each of our products 
many of our assets are floating rate loans  which are assumed to reprice immediately in proportion to a change in market rates as specified in the underlying contractual agreements 
accordingly  the simulation models use indexes to estimate these prepayments and reinvest the proceeds at current yields and historical experience at the bank to estimate prepayments 
our non term deposit products reprice more slowly  usually changing less than the change in market rates and at our discretion 
this analysis indicates the impact of changes in net interest income for the given set of rate changes and assumptions 
it assumes the balance sheet remains static and that its structure does not change over the course of the year 
it does not account for all factors that impact this analysis  including changes by management to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes or secondary impacts such as changes to our credit risk profile as interest rates change 
furthermore  loan prepayment rate estimates and spread relationships change regularly 
interest rate changes create changes in actual loan prepayment rates that will differ from the market estimates incorporated in this analysis 
changes that vary significantly from the assumptions may have significant effects on our net interest income 
for the rising and falling interest rate scenarios  the base market interest rate forecast was increased and decreased over months by and basis points 
at december   our net interest income exposure related to these hypothetical changes in market interest rates was within current guidelines 
as shown in the table below  at december   we have positioned our balance sheet to result in a slight improvement in net interest income for if a market interest rates decrease in thousands 
interest rate scenario adjusted net interest income percentage change from base up basis points up basis points base down basis points down basis points
