item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s financial statements and notes  included elsewhere in this report  and the information contained in selected financial and operating data 
overview stillwater mining company mines  processes  refines and markets palladium  platinum and minor amounts of other metals from the j m reef  an extensive trend of pgm mineralization located in stillwater and sweet grass counties in south central montana 
the company operates two mines stillwater and east boulder within the j m reef  each with substantial underground operations and a surface mill and concentrator 
concentrates produced at the two mines are shipped to the company s smelter and base metals refinery at columbus  montana  where the concentrates  along with spent auto catalytic and petroleum catalyst material  are processed into a pgm filter cake that is sent to third party refiners for final processing 
substantially all of the palladium and platinum produced from mining is sold under contracts with three major automotive manufacturers  general motors corporation  ford motor company  and mitsubishi corporation  for use in automotive catalytic converters 
these contracts include floor and  in some cases  ceiling prices on palladium and platinum that have benefited the company significantly in periods of low palladium prices 
the mitsubishi sales contract expired at december  sales commitments under the mitsubishi contract will largely be absorbed under the remaining agreements 
substantially all of the palladium  platinum and rhodium produced from the recycling of spent auto catalytic material is sold and delivered to financial intermediaries with whom the company hedges its price risk on this business 
performance the company had net income of million in  compared to a net loss of million in a detailed comparison of these outcomes is presented below in results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  during  the company produced from its mining operations a total of  ounces of palladium and  platinum including  ounces of palladium and  ounces of platinum 
the company met its mine production guidance for full year of between  and  ounces of pgms  despite several mine shutdowns during the third quarter due to wildfires 
capital spending remained high in  reflecting the company s program to extend the developed state of both mines  including increasing proven ore reserves and expanding infrastructure to facilitate a move to higher rates of production in the future 
although all of the planned development for the year was substantially completed  actual capital expenditures of million were nearly million below the company s guidance of million 
the company is targeting total mine pgm production of between  and  ounces for  reflecting the increased mine development and the early benefits of implementing more selective mining methods at both mines  although the company s ability to meet these targets is subject to certain risks 
capital expenditures are expected to be about million in  and include investment in a second furnace at the company s smelter in columbus  montana 
see risk factors achievement of the company s production goals is subject to uncertainties above 
during  the company recovered and processed from the recycling of auto catalytic converters and petroleum catalysts a total of  ounces of pgms in its smelting and refining facilities  thereby utilizing excess capacity in those facilities 
pgm recycling ounces processed grew by over ounces recycled in while the company has processed minor amounts of these materials since  in late the company entered into an agreement with a major us collector of such material to purchase substantial volumes for processing 
this agreement has since been modified and extended to facilitate expansion of these activities 
the commercial terms of this agreement are confidential  but either party is able to terminate the relationship at its discretion upon providing ninety days notice 
under the agreement  the company advances cash for purchase and collection of these spent catalyst materials 
these advances are reflected as advances on inventory purchases on the balance sheet until such time as the material has been received and title has transferred to the company 
the company also has spot purchase and tolling arrangements with other suppliers of spent catalytic materials 
in june  the company received  ounces of palladium from norilsk nickel as part of the consideration in the acquisition of an approximately ownership interest in the company 
the company entered into contracts in early with three customers to sell this palladium ratably over a two year period at a slight discount to market prices  thereby assuring transparency of these sales within the palladium market 
this sales program ended in the first quarter of when the company sold the final  ounces of this palladium inventory 

table of contents as disclosed in the company s annual report on form k  in reviewing and testing the company s internal controls over financial reporting at year end  the company identified several internal control deficiencies that in the judgment of management individually or in the aggregate comprised material weaknesses 
as a result  additional audit procedures were performed before the issuance of the company s audited financial statements to ensure that they fairly presented  in all material respects  the financial position of the company at december  the company further addressed these control deficiencies during the first half of and following additional testing reported that all material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting had been remedied 
the company has continued to monitor its internal controls during  and the company has performed required testing of internal controls over financial reporting as of december  management believes that the company s internal controls over financial reporting are  in all material respects  fully effective as of december  strategic initiatives the company s management is continuing to address several structural issues that bear on its future performance 
the structural issues being addressed include first  despite above market floor prices in the company s contracts with the auto companies and despite the company s costs per ounce of pgm production being competitive with other primary pgm producers in the industry  the company s high grade reserve is palladium rich with a ratio of ounces of palladium to one ounce platinum as compared with the platinum rich ratio of its south african peers 
consequently  the company s operations  as currently configured  are marginally competitive when palladium prices are low 
second  capital spending to extend the developed state of both mines and to expand smelting capacity was increased starting in and will continue to remain high through this has affected the company s cash generation capacity and liquidity 
as a result  although liquidity improved modestly in  liquidity is expected to remain constant or decline modestly in third  the company s operating profile has been essentially that of one product  one operation which would benefit from diversification and growth in light of the historical volatility of the pgm markets 
extended periods of low pgm prices  particularly once the floor prices in the company s auto contracts expire  could put both the company and its shareholders investment at risk 
while the company continues to view itself as a primary pgm producer  attractive opportunities to further diversify within pgms are scarce 
growth in the recycling of spent pgm catalytic material has begun the process of an operational diversification while complementing the company s pgm base 
gold  silver  nickel and copper are produced as by products of the company s operations 
management thinks it is prudent and beneficial to stockholders to diversify the current operational structure 
in response to these structural issues  the company is implementing a number of key strategic initiatives intended to secure a sustainable future for the company and its stockholders transforming the mines  marketing palladium and diversifying and growing operations and the company 
each initiative is intended to support sustainable development surrounding the company s business and is discussed in more detail in the following paragraphs 
each initiative is underway although full implementation will take several years 
those involving external markets are beyond management s direct control for which a projection of specific results and timing is not possible 
transforming mining operations stillwater mining company has identified a series of comprehensive operating changes designed to increase efficiency  reduce unit costs of production  and increase total pgm ounces produced  all in an effort to address the company s sustainability beyond when the company no longer has the benefit of the pgm pricing floors included in the current contracts with the auto companies 
these changes are grouped into five overlapping stages continue to advance safety performance at all operations increase the developed state of both mines expand the use of selective mining methods increase production levels reduce operating costs safety since  the company has implemented a multi faceted program of continual improvement in safety for employees throughout the company 
the company s get guide  educate and train safe safety and health management systems focus on accident prevention  seeking opportunities for safer mining methods and increased employee awareness and training 
specific areas of emphasis include enhanced work place examinations  joint union management safety committees  critical task analysis  loss control representatives drawn from the mining workforce  implementation of measurable safety standards and intra operational safety audits 
employee led focus teams have been successful in solving many safety related challenges 

table of contents during  continued safety emphasis resulted in an incidence rate reduction of from  bringing us to a total reduction since the inception of the get safe in in  attention to further employee participation and involvement will be enhanced through the involvement of loss control representatives drawn from the hourly workforce and the expanded implementation of internal safety auditing processes 
developed state in the company continued its program to increase the developed state of both mines  thereby increasing proven ore reserves to facilitate advanced planning and mining efficiency  and to add the necessary infrastructure support 
the developed state at both mines was intentionally decreased during the company s financial challenges beginning in late in the fall of  as palladium prices dropped sharply  the company curtailed development expenditures at the stillwater mine and brought the east boulder mine on line short of completion in order to conserve available cash 
at the same time there was an effort to increase production in order to generate additional cash flow resulting in a steady contraction of proven ore reserves at both mines 
during and  the company increased its capital spending program in an effort to expand proven ore reserves in support of higher production rates in the future 
capital spending was increased to million in  from million in and million in capital spending for currently is forecast at million and includes the addition of a second furnace at the company s smelter 
annual spending for primary development is targeted so as to achieve and then maintain proven ore reserves equal to about months production at each mine s full production potential or about million tons for the stillwater mine and million tons for the east boulder mine 
results of the capital program included a increase in total proven ore reserves to million tons  even after taking into account production 
major infrastructure projects during included an additional ventilation raise and expanded tailings pond facility at the east boulder mine  and a new sand plant and additional rail access at the stillwater mine 
primary development in company wide exceeded  feet of new footwall lateral and associated primary ramps  and  feet of diamond drilling 
significant projects at the mines during will include excavation of a decline to the  foot level and an additional ventilation portal at stillwater mine 
the majority of the funding needed for these programs will come from operations 
at december   the company has significant cash and other liquidity available to support these initiatives 
cash and cash equivalents  plus highly liquid investment holdings  totaled million at december   and unutilized revolving credit lines added another million of potential liquidity 
the company expects to draw against some of its cash holdings during  primarily to support the additional growth in the recycling business  but also in support of these development activities 
selective mining the use of mechanized bulk mining methods frequently requires mining widths and orientation not consistent with the ore reserve profiles in the company s mines 
after considerable study  the company concluded in that the inefficiencies of large mechanized mining methods more than offset its benefits and initiated a program to re introduce more selective mining methods in the mines 
the effort is well underway 
in the fourth quarter of  tons per day were being mined using captive cut and fill mining methods  up from tons per day on average in the change in mining methods has required some retraining of the workforce 
the advantages to the change are numerous including  higher ore grades  reduced secondary development to access the ore reduced equipment needs with the accompanying benefits of lower capital and support costs  increased recovery of the ore reserve and decreased cost of primary development per ounce of production 
this change involves greater use of conventional captive cut and fill mining  a method that inherently allows greater access to mine reserves  generates less waste rock and can follow the ore trend more closely along the j m reef 
the use of mechanical bulk mining methods in the past was driven by a decision made to increase production rates when the palladium price was high and by the limited availability of the skilled manpower that captive cut and fill mining requires 
increasing the percentage of mining in captive cut and fill stopes is more manpower intensive than mechanized methods  and there is a growing shortage of skilled miners 
as a result during the company initiated a comprehensive program to train a new generation of underground miners for the future 
this effort will require dedicating substantial resources to recruiting and training over a period of several years 
these mining positions are high paying and offer an attractive work schedule 
to date  the company has had no difficulty attracting interested candidates and the program provides a unique opportunity for the company to hire talent from local montana communities and to train them from the beginning in state of the art mining and safety practices 

table of contents these adjustments to the company s mining methods will initially result in a modest reduction in total ore tons produced and an expected increase in realized grade that more than offsets the tonnage reduction 
with less equipment and development required  over time capital expenditure requirements will be reduced  along with maintenance and support costs 
ultimately the net result will be to increase ounces produced at a reduced cost per ounce 
production increases the company plans over time to increase mine production to design capacity thereby increasing total pgm production and reducing unit cash costs 
design capacity at the stillwater mine is approximately  ore tons per day  and at the east boulder mine   ore tons per day  which would represent an increase of about over average production levels 
at design capacity production would be in excess of  ounces per year 
average daily production at the stillwater mine in was  tons  compared to  tons per day in the company intends to gradually increase production at the stillwater mine toward full capacity 
although the concentrator at the stillwater mine is designed for  tons per day  after allowing for reprocessing of slag from the smelter  net ore capacity is approximately  tons per day 
average daily production at the east boulder mine in was  tons per day  up from  tons per day during full permitted capacity at the east boulder concentrator is approximately  tons per day 
expanding smelter capacity with the continuing growth in the company s metallurgical processing volumes  both from increased mine production and from added recycling volumes  surplus furnace capacity at the smelter is becoming more restricted 
the furnace is lined with refractory brick that must be replaced periodically  requiring an extended four to five week shutdown of the smelter facility 
in the past  the company has simply stockpiled concentrates during the furnace shutdowns and has utilized the surplus capacity in the furnace to process the stockpiled material incrementally once the furnace came back online 
with the much higher level of furnace utilization currently required  in the future there will not be enough surplus capacity to process the accumulated stockpiles 
in response to this concern  the company has determined to invest approximately million over the next two years in upgrading the metallurgical facilities  including the addition of a second smelting furnace 
the second furnace will eliminate this stage of processing as a bottleneck  provide backup in the event of a catastrophic furnace outage  and potentially allow one of the furnaces to be used for slag cleaning  increasing total recovery of pgms in the circuits 
marketing palladium significant market support for platinum has existed for many years  while corresponding support for palladium has been limited 
the company hopes that palladium will emerge as a primary jewelry metal based mainly on its favorable price relative to gold and platinum 
the company closely followed this development championing and chronicling it for the industry 
moreover  the company has undertaken a leadership role in promoting market development for palladium 
palladium used for jewelry last year in its annual report  the company chronicled the potential of palladium jewelry as a substitute for white gold in the chinese jewelry markets  increasing from almost nothing in to over million ounces in  but declined slightly in in support of this developing market  the company began sponsoring regular jewelry industry technical articles for the us market on working with palladium in making jewelry 
the company also has worked with various jewelry manufacturers outside of china  assisting in their development of palladium jewelry lines for us and european markets 
palladium wedding jewelry and accessories  including a bridal line  are now widely available in the us palladium chains are now being produced in italy for distribution worldwide 
palladium s lower price and lower comparative weight relative to white gold  combined with its high purity and attractive bright white appearance  appear to be driving this emerging popularity 
in early  stillwater mining company formed the palladium alliance international pai  a not for profit industry marketing organization 
pai promotes the use of palladium in the jewelry market worldwide 
the company has discussed the concept of the pai with industry participants and invited their participation 
the pai was first introduced at the ja jewelry show in new york city in early it was formally launched at the jck show in las vegas in june of and in shanghai and beijing later in the year 
these efforts have generated interest from the jewelry industry 

table of contents palladium used for diesel engines two years ago  in response to the development of catalytic converters for diesel engines using only platinum  the company recognized and reported that the higher temperature stability of palladium could make it a useful adjunct to the use of platinum in reducing diesel particulate matter ie  soot emitted by diesel engines 
since then  this technology has been developed and implemented 
with the migration from clean gasoline engines using palladium rich catalytic converters to clean diesel engines which now enjoy almost a market share of new cars produced in europe and have potential for much broader use in other regions of the world platinum has tended to predominate for these vehicles 
however  partial substitution of palladium for platinum in diesel catalytic converters has been increasing over the past several years  largely driven by the relative economics 
the mandatory introduction of ultra low sulfur diesel in the united states during has also facilitated increased use of palladium in controlling diesel emissions 
palladium used for hydrogen energy the company has also turned its attention to potential applications for palladium in fuel cells and a future hydrogen economy 
significant research programs already exist with government and private funding in these areas  so the company does not see any need for a role in funding direct palladium research at this time 
however  the company has encouraged the allocation of government research funds to this area  and has tracked published papers regarding research findings on topics of potential interest 
the company also has informally encouraged consideration of palladium as an alternative in applications that would appear to hold promise  particularly with regard to fuel cell technology 
diversification while stillwater mining company regards itself as principally a palladium and platinum company  it has not limited its consideration of future growth opportunities to pgms  given the scarcity of pgm resources 
in the company entered into a long term sourcing agreement for spent auto catalytic materials utilizing its smelter and base metal refinery to recycle these materials reclaiming them for reuse 
materials processed grew respectably in and  but during the company sharply increased the material processed to  ounces or up over the volumes processed in recognizing the sustaining impact this has for both the company s business and the environment  the company plans to continue to expand this activity 
additional materials are being sourced in the market 
a second smelting furnace is being constructed to provide both capacity and reliability of operation 
thus  growth in the recycling of spent pgm catalytic material has begun the process of an operational diversification while complementing the company s pgm base 
the company also produces gold  silver  nickel and copper as by products from its existing operations  each of which would be geologically and operationally compatible with its existing capabilities and expertise 
because mines  by their very nature  have a finite life  either through exhaustion of their minerals or exhaustion of their economics  mining companies often seek to reduce single mine risk by developing a portfolio of mines and reserve holdings 
in view of the scarcity of economically attractive pgm projects  the company believes that it should consider other metals and perhaps diversify its business 
during the fourth quarter of  the company invested million to secure approximately an interest in pacific north west capital corp  a canadian exploration company that centers its efforts on identifying and defining potential pgm reserve targets 
management believes that gaining access to pacific north west capital s seasoned exploration staff will result in a more effective exploration program than could be achieved using an internal exploration effort at this time 
the company will report further on this diversification initiative as appropriate 
key issues facing the company several issues need to be addressed in conjunction with the company s ongoing strategic efforts 
these are outlined briefly below contracts beginning in  the major us bond rating agencies have successively downgraded the corporate ratings of general motors corporation and ford motor company  two of the company s major customers 
under applicable law  in the event one or both of these companies should become insolvent or file for protection under the bankruptcy statutes  their respective obligations under the pgm supply agreements could be voided 
in addition  under the terms of the company s credit facility  a default by ford or general motors or the early termination of these contracts could prohibit additional loans and trigger a requirement for the immediate repayment of the company s outstanding loans 
the deterioration of the credit of these two customers places additional emphasis on the company s need to reduce its mining costs  so as to reduce its dependency on the above market pricing in the automotive contracts 
in late  the company entered into an agreement with a major us collector of spent catalyst material to purchase substantial volumes for processing 
this agreement has since been modified and extended to facilitate expansion of these activities 
the commercial terms of this agreement are confidential  but either party is able to terminate the relationship at its discretion upon providing ninety days notice 
under the agreement  the company advances cash for purchase and collection of these spent catalyst materials 
these advances are reflected as advances on inventory purchases on the balance sheet until such time as the material has been received and title has transferred to the company 
the company also has spot purchase and tolling arrangements with other suppliers of spent catalytic materials 

table of contents miners with the general strengthening of mineral prices over the past two years  the demand for experienced miners has grown significantly 
there is now a shortage of skilled miners within the united states and canada  and as new operations are developed  the shortage has grown 
coming off the past decade or so of depressed commodity prices  very few new miners and mining engineers were being trained  so the industry is now faced with a fixed or declining pool of skilled workers in an expanding market 
the company s operations are relatively manpower intensive  so a shortage of skilled labor could restrict the company s ability to maintain or expand production levels 
as already noted  over the past year the company has introduced a major miner training program to develop a corps of new  skilled miners within the company 
labor contract the company s hourly workforce is represented by the united steelworkers of america under two separate labor agreements 
the agreement covering the workers at the stillwater mine and at the company s processing facilities in columbus  montana will expire on july  the separate labor agreement covering the hourly workforce at the east boulder mine was renewed during and will expire on july  the company cannot assure that it will be able to renew those contracts in a timely or satisfactory manner and not experience labor interruptions or other disputes with labor unions or employees in the future 
pgm prices the volatility of pgm prices  driven in part by occasional supply surpluses that emerge particularly in palladium  is of significant long term concern at the company s current production cost levels 
obviously  the company has no direct control over pgm prices  although there are steps it can take hedging  long term sales agreements  etc 
to reduce exposure to price volatility 
producer economics  along with recycling opportunities  suggest that the supply of pgms is likely to grow gradually over time  both from the expansion of existing operations and from new mining ventures 
that leaves some opportunity on the demand side for fostering new or expanded uses for pgms  and particularly for palladium 
platinum hedges as of december   the company had secured platinum prices in the forward market by entering into financially settled forward transactions covering over half of the company s anticipated platinum mine production for the period from january through june these transactions are intended to reduce the company s financial exposure in the event that recent historically high prices for platinum were to weaken substantially in the future 
as of december   the company had open financially settled forward contracts covering a total of  ounces of platinum at an overall average price of about per ounce 
the hedges are expected to modestly reduce the overall volatility of the company s earnings and cash flow 
under these hedging arrangements  in return for protection against downward movements in the platinum price  the company gives up the benefit of increases in the platinum price on the hedged ounces 
the company recorded costs in totaling million for financially settled forward contracts that settled below market price during corresponding costs recorded in and totaled million and million  respectively 
unrealized hedging losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the company s december  statement of financial position  based on the closing market price for platinum on december   totaled million 
capitalized mine development mine development expenditures incurred to increase existing production  develop new orebodies or develop mineral property substantially in advance of production are capitalized and amortized using a units of production method 
mine development expenditures include shafts  surface adits and underground infrastructure development  including footwall laterals  ramps  rail and transportation  electrical and ventilation systems  shop facilities  material handling areas  ore handling facilities  dewatering and pumping facilities 
these facilities generally are required not only for current operations  but also as continuing infrastructure in support of future planned operations 
the company calculates amortization of capitalized mine development costs by the application of an amortization rate to current production in each applicable area of the mine 
the amortization rate is based upon unamortized capitalized mine development costs and the related ore reserves 
capital development expenditures are added to the unamortized capitalized mine development costs as the related assets are placed into service 
in the calculation of the amortization rate  changes in ore reserves are accounted for as a prospective change in estimate 
ore reserves and the further benefit of capitalized mine development costs are based on significant management assumptions 
any changes in these assumptions  such as a change in the mine plan or a change in estimated proven and probable ore reserves  could have a material effect on the expected period of benefit resulting in a potentially significant change in the amortization rate and or the valuations of related assets 
the company s proven ore reserves are generally expected to be extracted utilizing its existing mine development infrastructure 
probable ore reserves normally cannot be extracted without additional capital expenditures required to access and delineate them 
these anticipated capital expenditures are not included in the current calculation of depreciation and amortization 

table of contents the company changed its accounting method for amortizing capitalized mine development costs effective january  prior to  the company amortized all such capitalized development costs at its mines over all proven and probable reserves at each mine 
following an asset impairment write down at the end of  the company revisited its assumptions and estimates for amortizing capitalized mine development costs 
as a result  the company changed its method of accounting for the amortization of development costs as follows unamortized costs of the shaft at the stillwater mine and the initial development at the east boulder mine are treated as life of mine infrastructure costs  to be amortized over total proven and probable reserves at each location  and all development costs of footwall laterals and ramps  including similar development costs incurred before  are to be amortized over the ore reserves in the immediate and geologically relevant vicinity of the development 
this change in accounting method  under generally accepted accounting principles then in effect  required the company to measure the cumulative effect of the change at january   as if the new method of amortization had been used in all prior years 
the credit for the cumulative effect of the change for all years prior to of million is shown as the cumulative effect of accounting change in the statement of operations and comprehensive income loss for the year ended december  expenditures incurred to sustain existing production and to access specific reserve blocks or stopes provide benefit to ore reserve production over limited periods of time secondary development and are charged to operations as incurred 
these costs include ramp and stope access excavations from primary haulage levels footwall laterals  stope material rehandling laydown excavations  stope ore and waste pass excavations and chute installations  stope ventilation raise excavations and stope utility and pipe raise excavations 
revenues under the terms of sales contracts and purchase orders received from customers  the company recognizes revenue when the product is in a refined and saleable form and title passes  which is typically when the product is transferred from the account of the company to the account of the customer 
the company s revenue and earnings are significantly influenced by worldwide market prices of palladium and platinum  which can be volatile and over which the company has little or no control 
sales to significant customers represented approximately  and of total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
although the company sells its metals to a small number of customers and brokers  the company could  if the need were to arise  readily sell its metal on a spot basis and at spot prices in any of the various commodity markets throughout the world 
from time to time  the company has used basic hedging techniques involving fixed forwards  cashless put and call option collars and financially settled forwards 
the objective of such metals hedging transactions has been to secure firm prices for the company s pgm production  to benefit from price increases or to protect against price decreases on that portion of production that falls outside the range of the floor or ceiling prices embedded in the long term contracts with the automotive companies 
such hedging contracts also may preclude the company from obtaining the full benefit of increased market prices for its contracted metals 
in  the company reported a charge against income of million representing the difference between financially settled forward prices and actual market prices at the date of settlement all related to mine production 
in and  the corresponding effect on income was million all related to mine production and million a million charge against mine production and a million credit to recycling activities  respectively 
see business and properties sales and hedging activities 
the company currently uses forward contracts and financially settled forwards to manage the potential negative effects of metal price volatility on its financial results 
during  the company entered into various fixed forwards and financially settled forward contracts that were accounted for as cash flow hedges 
at december   the company had hedging contracts in place covering  ounces of metal sales through june see business and properties sales and hedging activities 
the company has credit agreements with its major trading partners that provide for margin deposits in the event that forward prices for metals exceed the company s hedge contract prices by a predetermined margin limit 
as of december   no such margin deposits were outstanding or due 

table of contents the company s revenues and ounces sold were as follows for the years ended december year ended december  palladium platinum rhodium other total ounces of ounces of ounces of total in thousands revenue revenue revenue revenue revenue palladium platinum rhodium ounces mine production pgm recycling sales of palladium received in norilsk nickel transaction other total mine production pgm recycling sales of palladium received in norilsk nickel transaction other total mine production pgm recycling sales of palladium received in norilsk nickel transaction other total results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues revenues were million in  compared to million in  a increase 
most of the increase was attributable to much higher sales volumes in the company s recycling business in  as well as higher market prices for the platinum group metals 
revenues from mine production were million in  compared to million in  a increase 
the increase was attributable both to higher mine production in and to higher pgm prices 
ounces sold from mine production were  in  compared to  ounces in the average realization on these sales including the effects of hedging and of floor and ceiling prices in the underlying contracts was per ounce in and per ounce in revenues from pgm recycling grew substantially  increasing to million in  from million in  as volumes of recycled material processed increased sharply in recycled ounces sold  excluding tolled material  nearly doubled in to  ounces compared to  ounces in the company s combined average realization on recycling sales which include palladium  platinum and rhodium was  per ounce in  up sharply from per ounce in the company processed lower volumes of recycled materials on a tolling basis in the company toll processed approximately  ounces of pgms  down from approximately  tolled ounces in revenues from sales of palladium received in the norilsk nickel transaction and other miscellaneous revenues declined to million in from million in within these totals  sales of palladium received in the norilsk nickel transaction generated million in revenues during on sales of approximately  ounces of palladium from inventory at an average realization of per ounce 
these sales ended in the first quarter of when this palladium inventory was exhausted 
comparable palladium sales for generated million of revenue on  ounces sold  for an average realization of per ounce  reflecting a full year of these sales from inventory in  but at somewhat lower average realized prices 
one of the sales contracts providing for the sale and delivery of the palladium ounces received in the norilsk nickel transaction also required the company to provide  ounces platinum and  ounces of rhodium per month  either purchased on the open market or produced from the company s mining operations 
the company recognized other miscellaneous revenue of million and million for metal purchased in the open market and resold under these sales contracts in and  respectively 

table of contents cost of metals sold cost of metals sold  which excludes depreciation expense  was million in  compared to million in  an increase 
the substantial growth in recycling volumes during was accompanied by million of increased cost in purchasing the recycled catalyst 
partially offsetting this increase was a million decrease in expense reflecting a much smaller volume of sales related to the inventory received in the norilsk nickel transaction including the platinum and rhodium ounces purchased in the open market and re sold under these contractual commitments 
the remaining million is largely the result of increased sales during the cost of metals sold from mine production was million in  compared to million in  a increase 
the cost increase is driven mostly by the increase in ounces sold during  although cost of metal sold per ounce declined slightly from per ounce in to per ounce in with the production increase 
the cost of metals sold from pgm recycling activities was million in  compared to million in  a increase 
the increase was about equally attributable to the higher metal equivalent prices paid in to acquire catalytic materials for recycling and to the volume growth in this business during the average cost of metal per ounce increased from in to  in  reflecting much higher average prices for pgms  and particularly for rhodium 
the cost of metals sold from sales of palladium received in the norilsk nickel transaction and other activities was million in  compared to million in this decrease in was primarily due to completion of the two year program to sell the palladium received in the norilsk nickel transaction  that program ended in early the total cost attributable to palladium sold from just those ounces received in the norilsk nickel transaction was million in  representing the sale of approximately  ounces of palladium at an average cost of just over per ounce 
the corresponding cost of palladium in was million on the sale of  ounces at about the same average cost per ounce 
the remainder of these sales in both years represents mostly the cost of sourcing platinum and rhodium to meet contractual commitments 
as discussed in revenues above  the company entered into sales contracts in  which required it to source metal from third parties in order to fulfill delivery commitments to customers 
the cost of metals sold from activities under these contracts  excluding sales of palladium received in the norilsk nickel transaction  was million and million in and respectively 
during  the company s mining operations produced approximately  ounces of pgms  including approximately  and  ounces of palladium and platinum  respectively 
this represents about an increase from  during which the company s mining operations produced approximately  ounces of pgms  including approximately  and  ounces of palladium and platinum  respectively 
the company modestly reduced its emphasis on primary mine development during  allowing some resources previously dedicated during to primary development to be redeployed into production in the stillwater mine produced approximately  ounces of pgms in  compared with approximately  ounces of pgms in  a increase 
the east boulder mine produced approximately  ounces of pgms in  compared with approximately  ounces of pgms in  a year on year increase 
these production increases  again  were attributable to the redeployment of resources into production in and  to a lesser extent  to continuing progress in enhancing the developed state of the mines 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was million in  compared to million in  a increase 
this increase resulted from the additional depletion expense for capital development placed into service during  as well as from the increased production during exploration the company participated in an exploratory drilling program during  spending about million 
there were no corresponding exploration expenditures during marketing the company expanded its market development efforts for palladium during  largely in support of the palladium alliance international  spending approximately million on marketing  up from million in general and administrative general and administrative costs were million in  compared to million in  a increase 
the increase in corporate costs was driven primarily by increased professional services and compensation costs in 
table of contents interest income and expense interest income increased to million in from million in  reflecting both increased interest on greater recycling volumes and higher interest rates as the us federal reserve board increased short term rates 
the company s balance of cash and related liquid assets earning interest decreased to million at december  from million at december  interest expense declined slightly to million in from million in on modestly reduced debt balances 
the company has reduced its outstanding debt to million at december  from million at december  total income tax provision the company has not recorded any income tax expense in or  other than for certain state minimum taxes paid 
changes in the company s net deferred tax assets have been offset by the change in the related valuation allowance 
other comprehensive income loss  net of tax the company recorded a gain in other comprehensive income of million in compared to a loss of million in the gain included million of realized hedging losses reclassified to income  partially offset by million representing the change in fair value of derivatives held  and  of unrealized loss on investments held for sale 
the loss included million of net unrealized losses on hedging transactions  and million of unrealized gain on investments held for sale year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues revenues were million in  compared to million in  a increase 
most of the increase was attributable to higher market prices for platinum and rhodium  including metal purchased for resale 
revenues from mine production were million in  compared to million in  a decrease 
ounces sold from mine production were  in  compared to  ounces in the average realization on these sales including the effects of hedging and of floor and ceiling prices in the underlying contracts was per ounce in and per ounce in revenues from pgm recycling were million in  compared to million in this increase in revenues from pgm recycling was due both to an increase to  ounces in the quantity of recycled pgms sold in  compared to  ounces in  and to substantially higher market prices for platinum and rhodium in in addition to the sales of recycled pgm ounces  the company also processes higher volumes of recycled materials on a tolling basis  smelting and refining materials owned by others for a fee 
during  the company toll processed approximately  tolled ounces of pgms  up from approximately  tolled ounces in revenues from sales of palladium received in the norilsk nickel transaction and other miscellaneous revenues totaled million in  compared to million in within these totals  sales of palladium received in the norilsk nickel transaction alone generated million in revenues during on sales of approximately  ounces of palladium at an average realization of per ounce 
comparable palladium sales for generated million in revenue on  ounces  for an average realization of per ounce  reflecting somewhat higher average market prices for palladium during the company has approximately  ounces of palladium received in the norilsk nickel transaction remaining in inventory at december   all scheduled to be sold during january and february of one of the sales contracts providing for the sale and delivery of the palladium ounces received in the norilsk nickel transaction also requires the company to provide  ounces platinum and  ounces of rhodium per month  either purchased on the open market or produced from the company s mining operations 
the company recognized revenue of million and million under these sales contracts in and  respectively 
cost of metals sold cost of metals sold was million in  compared to million in  a increase 
approximately million of the million increase is related to sales of the palladium received in the norilsk nickel transaction and purchases of platinum and rhodium for resale 
another million relates to increased volumes and higher acquisition cost for recycled pgm materials 
the remainder is largely attributable to higher labor and materials costs at the company s operating mines and to the million cost of a lower of cost or market inventory adjustment to reflect a market value of metals lower than cost in inventory at december  
table of contents the cost of metals sold from mine production was million in  compared to million in  a increase 
the cost increase is driven slightly by the increase in ounces sold during and by the write off of million in consigned inventory 
more significant  however  are increased costs for labor and key raw materials particularly steel and fuel that have increased substantially since labor costs increased year on year by  while total materials and supplies  including maintenance supplies  increased 
the cost of metals sold from pgm recycling activities was million in  compared to million in the increase was primarily due to the higher cost of acquiring catalytic materials for recycling as the underlying prices for platinum and rhodium contained in those materials increased during actual ounces of material from recycling increased by only  but average platinum prices increased by and average rhodium prices rose nearly year on year 
the cost of metals sold from sales of palladium received in the norilsk nickel transaction and other activities was million in  compared to million in this increase was driven both by higher metal volumes and by significantly higher platinum and rhodium prices  offset in part by somewhat lower palladium prices 
the total cost of palladium sold from just those ounces received in the norilsk nickel transaction was million in  representing the sale of approximately  ounces of palladium at an average cost of just over per ounce 
the comparable cost for the  ounces sold during was approximately million 
the remainder of these sales in both years represents mostly the cost of sourcing platinum and rhodium to meet contractual commitments 
as discussed in revenues above  the company entered into sales contracts in  which required it to source metal from third parties in order to fulfill delivery commitments to customers 
the cost of metals sold from activities under these contracts  excluding sales of palladium received in the norilsk nickel transaction  was million and million in and respectively 
most of the year on year difference here is attributable to higher volumes and costs for rhodium purchases 
during  the company s mining operations produced approximately  ounces of pgms  including approximately  and  ounces of palladium and platinum  respectively 
this represents about a reduction from  during which the company s mining operations produced approximately  ounces of pgms  including approximately  and  ounces of palladium and platinum  respectively 
the production decrease in is primarily attributable to diversion of a portion of production resources into development activities during in order to improve the developed state of both mines 
the stillwater mine produced approximately  ounces of pgms in  compared with approximately  ounces of pgms in  a decrease 
the east boulder mine produced approximately  ounces of pgms in  compared with approximately  ounces of pgms in  a year on year increase 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was million in  compared to million in  a increase 
this increase is primarily due to the additional depletion expense for capital development placed into service during the company projects that depreciation and amortization expense will be approximately the same as for 
general and administrative general and administrative costs were million in  compared to million in  a increase 
the increase is driven primarily by increased professional services and compensation costs 
loss on disposal of property  plant and equipment during  gains and losses on property  plant  and equipment disposed of were not significant 
during  the company exercised an option to buy out of an operating lease for a tunnel boring machine 
the company simultaneously wrote off of the asset  resulting in a charge against income of million 
interest income and expense interest income increased to million in from million in  reflecting higher interest rates as the us federal reserve board has steadily increased short term rates 
the company s balance of cash and related liquid assets also increased from million at december   to million at december  however  interest expense actually declined from million in to million in interest expense for included higher interest rates under the previous credit agreement  plus the write off of million of unamortized financing costs in conjunction with the refinancing in august of the company also has reduced its total outstanding long term debt from million at december  to million at december  
table of contents total income tax provision the company has not recorded any income tax expense in or  other than for certain state minimum taxes paid 
changes in the company s net deferred tax assets have been offset by the change in the related valuation allowance 
other comprehensive income loss  net of tax the company recorded a loss in other comprehensive income of million in  and a comparable loss of million in the loss included million of net unrealized losses on hedging transactions  and of unrealized gain on investments held for sale 
the loss was entirely attributable to unrealized losses on hedging transactions 
liquidity and capital resources for  net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to and million for and  respectively 
the company s net cash flow from operating activities is affected by several key factors  including net realized prices for its products  cash costs of production  and the level of pgm production from the mines 
at the pgm price levels prevailing at december   absent separate hedging arrangements  a change in the price of platinum generally would flow through almost dollar for dollar to cash flow from operations  subject only to price ceilings on a small portion of the company s long term sales contracts  and certain costs severance taxes and royalties on mine production which adjust upward or downward with market prices 
however  as of december   the company has hedged a significant portion of its sales of mined platinum through june of in general  as of december   these hedges were fixed at platinum prices at or below current market prices  and therefore the company s participation in increases in the price of platinum would be limited to the unhedged portion of production 
under the company s long term sales contracts for mined production  a change in the market price of palladium  at prices prevailing on december   would not flow through to cash flow from operations  except to the extent that the market price for palladium exceeded any of the price floors in those contracts 
the company enters into fixed forward contracts that set the selling price of pgms in its recycling activities  so for outstanding recycling lots  a change in the market price of platinum and palladium on sales of recycling materials would have little or no effect on margins earned from this activity and on cash flow from operations 
however  a percentage change in market prices would affect margins on future lots by about the same percentage as the change in price 
it normally takes existing lots of recycling material two to three months from the date of receipt to clear to sales 
changes in the cash costs of production generally flow through dollar for dollar into cash flow from operations 
a reduction due to grade in total mine production of  or about  ounces per year  would reduce cash flow from operations by an estimated million per year at the price and cost levels prevailing at december  the company s forecasts indicate that such a reduction in mine production would not impair the company s ability to repay its outstanding debt or to maintain its planned level of capital expenditures  although a significantly larger reduction in mine production could adversely affect the company s financial position 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the company s investing activities primarily represent capital expenditures of million  million and million in  and  respectively  see note to the company s financial statements and changes in highly liquid investments 
the company also purchased an equity interest in pacific north west capital corp 
for about million during net cash used by financing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net cash used by financing activities in is primarily due to payments of debt under the company s credit facility and capital lease payments 
at december   the company s available cash was million and it had million outstanding as debt and capital leases 
if highly liquid investments are included  the company s balance sheet liquidity increases to million  and unused revolving credit lines add another million of available liquidity 
letters of credit totaling million were outstanding under the revolving credit facility at december  during  the company will be required to make total payments of approximately million for principal reductions on its debt and capital leases 
the million of required payments includes million in scheduled principal payments on the outstanding borrowings under the company s credit agreement 
the company at current interest rate levels will also be required to pay approximately million in total interest payments during related to its debt and capital lease agreements 

table of contents credit agreement on august   the company entered into a million credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions that replaced the company s previous million credit facility 
the credit facility consists of a million six year term loan facility maturing july   bearing interest at a variable rate plus a margin london interbank offer rate libor plus  currently  basis points  or at december  and a million five year revolving credit facility bearing interest when drawn at a variable rate plus a margin libor plus basis points  or at december  expiring july  the revolving credit facility includes a letter of credit facility 
undrawn amounts under the letters of credit issued through this facility as of december   carry an annual fee of 
both the margin on the revolving credit facility and the letter of credit fee adjust contractually based on the company s leverage ratio  as defined  which began after the first quarter of the remaining unused portion of the revolving credit facility bears an annual commitment fee of 
amortization of the term loan facility commenced in august as of december   the company has million outstanding under the term loan facility 
during  the company obtained  and has subsequently renewed  a letter of credit in the amount of million as surety for its long term reclamation obligation at east boulder mine 
during  the company obtained a second letter of credit in the amount of million used as collateral for the company s surety bonds 
in the company increased that letter of credit to million reducing the amount available under the revolving credit facility to million at december  the credit facility requires as prepayments of the company s annual excess cash flow as defined in the credit agreement  plus any proceeds from asset sales and the issuance of debt or equity securities  subject to specified exceptions 
such prepayments are to be applied first against the term loan facility balance  and once that is reduced to zero  against any outstanding revolving credit facility balance 
the company s term loan facility  as amended on january   allows the company to choose between libor loans of various maturities plus a spread of or alternate base rate loans plus a spread of 
the alternate base rate is a rate determined by the administrative agent under the terms of the credit facility  and has generally been equal to the prevailing bank prime loan rate  which was at december  the alternate base rate applies only to that portion of the term loan facility in any period for which the company has not elected to use libor contracts 
substantially all the property and assets of the company are pledged as security under the credit facility 
in accordance with the terms of the credit facility  the company was required to utilize of the net proceeds from sales of palladium received in the norilsk nickel transaction to prepay its term loan facility 
this sales program ended during the first quarter of during  the company prepaid million in connection with such sales 
as of december   million of the company s debt has been classified as a current liability representing that portion of the term loan facility expected to be prepaid during the next twelve months 
covenants in the credit facility include restrictions or limitations on the company s ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends or redeem capital stock  grant liens  make investments  acquisitions  dispositions or enter into mergers  enter into transactions with affiliates  make capital expenditures  refinance or prepay subordinated debt  change the nature of the company s business or cease operations at the principal operating properties  and enter into commodity hedging for volumes in excess of expected production 
the company is also subject to financial covenants including a debt to ebitda ie  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ratio  a debt service coverage ratio  limitations on annual capital expenditures  and a minimum liquidity requirement 
in response to notice from the credit facility lenders  on july   the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement that has the effect of fixing the interest rate on million of the company s outstanding term loan debt through december  the effective fixed rate of the interest rate swap is 
the company has elected not to account for this as a cash flow hedge and accordingly recorded interest expense of approximately  during in conjunction with this transaction 
as of december  and  million and  million  respectively  of the company s debt was classified as a current liability representing that portion of the term loan facility expected to be prepaid under this arrangement during the succeeding twelve months 

table of contents aside from failure to meet financial covenants  other events of default under the terms of the credit facility include a cross default linked to other indebtedness of the company  any material modification to the life of mine plans  absent lender consent  a change of control of the company  subject to certain exceptions  and any material breach by a counterparty to a material sales contract or any unapproved modification or termination of such a sales contract 
the company is in compliance with its covenants under the credit facility at december  in preparing its business plan for  the company has projected its ability to meet the financial covenants in the credit agreement during while the company expects to remain in compliance with all financial ratios  the capital expenditure forecast anticipates exceeding the annual limit on capital expenditures for and the company has reviewed this forecast with the affected lenders and expects to reach a resolution before an event of default occurs 
on january   the company completed an amendment to the credit facility that reduced the interest rate spreads on the term loan by basis points to a previous provision that required the company to fix the interest rate on of the outstanding term loan balance through december   if and when the underlying three month libor reached was also amended  increasing the hedging threshold to 
under the terms of the amendment  the company would pay a penalty on certain voluntary prepayment transactions that occur within one year of the effective date of the amendment

additional information regarding factors which could cause results to differ materially from management s expectations is found in the section entitled risk factors above 
critical accounting policies mine development expenditures capitalization and amortization mining operations are inherently capital intensive  generally requiring substantial capital investment for the initial and concurrent development and infrastructure of the mine 
many of these expenditures are necessarily incurred well in advance of actual extraction of ore 
underground mining operations such as those conducted by the company require driving tunnels and sinking shafts that provide access to the underground orebody and construction and development of infrastructure  including electrical and ventilation systems  rail and other forms of transportation  shop facilities  material handling areas and hoisting systems 
ore mining and removal operations require significant underground facilities used to conduct mining operations and to transport the ore out of the mine to processing facilities located above ground 
contemporaneously with mining  additional development is undertaken to provide access to ongoing extensions of the orebody  allowing more ore to be produced 
in addition to the development costs that have been previously incurred  these ongoing development expenditures are necessary to access and support all future mining activities 
mine development expenditures incurred to date to increase existing production  develop new orebodies or develop mineral property substantially in advance of production are capitalized 
mine development expenditures consist of vertical shafts  multiple surface adits and underground infrastructure development including footwall laterals  ramps  rail and transportation  electrical and ventilation systems  shop facilities  material handling areas  ore handling facilities  dewatering and pumping facilities 
many such facilities are required not only for current operations  but also for all future planned operations 
expenditures incurred to sustain existing production and access specific ore reserve blocks or stopes provide benefit to ore reserve production over limited periods of time secondary development and are charged to operations as incurred 
these costs include ramp and stope access excavations from primary haulage levels footwall laterals  stope material rehandling laydown excavations  stope ore and waste pass excavations and chute installations  stope ventilation raise excavations and stope utility and pipe raise excavations 
the company calculates amortization of capitalized mine development costs by the application of an amortization rate to current production 
the amortization rate is based upon un amortized capitalized mine development costs  and the related ore reserves 
capital development expenditures are added to the un amortized capitalized mine development costs as the related assets are placed into service 
in the calculation of the amortization rate  changes in ore reserves are accounted for as a prospective change in estimate 
ore reserves and the further benefit of capitalized mine development costs are based on significant management assumptions 
any changes in these assumptions  such as a change in the mine plan or a change in estimated proven and probable ore reserves could have a material effect on the expected period of benefit resulting in a potentially significant change in the amortization rate and or the valuations of related assets 
the company s proven ore reserves are generally expected to be extracted utilizing its existing mine development infrastructure 
additional capital expenditures will be required to access the company s estimated probable ore reserves 
these anticipated capital expenditures are not included in the current calculation of depreciation and amortization 
the company changed its accounting method for amortizing capitalized mine development costs effective january  these mine development costs include the initial costs incurred to gain primary access to the ore reserves  plus the ongoing development costs of footwall laterals and ramps driven parallel to the reef that are used to access and provide support for the mining stopes in the reef 

table of contents prior to  the company amortized all such capitalized development costs at its mines over all proven and probable reserves at each mine 
following an asset impairment write down at the end of  the company revisited its assumptions and estimates for amortizing capitalized mine development costs 
following this review  the company determined to change its method of accounting for development costs as follows unamortized costs of the shaft at the stillwater mine and the initial development at the east boulder mine will continue to be treated as life of mine infrastructure costs  to be amortized over total proven and probable reserves at each location  and all ongoing development costs of footwall laterals and ramps  including similar development costs incurred before  will be amortized over the ore reserves in the immediate and geologically relevant vicinity of the development 
this change in accounting method  under generally accepted accounting principles then in effect  required the company to measure the effect of the change at january   as if the new method of amortization had been used in all prior years 
the credit for the cumulative effect of the change for all years prior to of million is shown as the cumulative effect of accounting change in the statement of operations and comprehensive income loss for the year ended december  the company s financial statements also include the pro forma effect of the accounting change on its and financial results 
the calculation of the amortization rate  and therefore the annual amortization charge to operations  could be materially affected to the extent that actual production in the future is different from current forecasts of production based on proven and probable ore reserves 
this would generally occur to the extent that there were significant changes in any of the factors or assumptions used in determining ore reserves 
these factors could include an expansion of proven and probable ore reserves through development activities  differences between estimated and actual costs of mining due to differences in grade or metal recovery rates  and differences between actual commodity prices and commodity price assumptions used in the estimation of ore reserves 
asset impairment the company follows statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company reviews and evaluates its long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
impairment is considered to exist if total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the asset 
future cash flows include estimates of recoverable ounces  pgm prices considering current and historical prices  long term sales contract prices  price trends and related factors  production levels  and capital and reclamation expenditures  all based on life of mine plans and projections 
if the assets are impaired  a calculation of fair market value is performed  and if fair market value is lower than the carrying value of the assets  the assets are reduced to their fair market value 
in accordance with the methodology prescribed by sfas no 
 the company has determined that the carrying value of the company s assets was not impaired at december  or december  
table of contents income taxes income taxes are determined using the asset and liability approach in accordance with the provisions of of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this method gives consideration to the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax rates 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
each quarter  management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
a valuation allowance has been provided at december   and december   for the portion of the company s net deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that they will not be realized see note to the company s financial statements 
based on the company s current financial projections  and in view of the level of tax depreciation and depletion deductions available  it appears unlikely that the company will owe any income taxes for the foreseeable future 
however  if average realized pgm prices were to increase substantially in the future  the company could owe income taxes prospectively on the resulting higher taxable income 
post closure reclamation costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  the company recognizes the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset 
the liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to operating expense 
if the obligation ultimately is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability  the company will recognize a gain or loss at the time of settlement 
accounting for reclamation obligations requires management to make estimates for each mining operation of the future costs the company will incur to complete final reclamation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations 
actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated 
additionally  future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work that the company is required to perform 
any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amounts charged to operations for reclamation and remediation 
the company reviewed its asset retirement assumptions at december  and determined that a net increase of million related to the east boulder mine was necessary 
this adjustment consisted of an increase of million related to estimated additional reclamation costs  offset by a reduction of million due to an increase in the estimated mine life of the east boulder mine 
derivative instruments from time to time  the company enters into derivative financial instruments  including fixed forwards  cashless put and call option collars and financially settled forwards to manage the effect of changes in the prices of palladium and platinum on the company s revenue 
the company accounts for its derivatives in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which requires that derivatives be reported on the balance sheet at fair value and  if the derivative is not designated as a hedging instrument  changes in fair value must be recognized in earnings in the period of change 
if the derivative is designated as a hedge and to the extent such hedge is determined to be highly effective  changes in fair value are either a offset by the change in fair value of the hedged asset or liability if applicable or b reported as a component of other comprehensive income in the period of change  and subsequently recognized in the determination of net income in the period the offsetting hedged transaction occurs 
the company primarily uses derivatives to hedge metal prices and to manage interest rate risk 
as of december   the outstanding derivatives associated with commodity instruments are valued at an unrealized cost of million  and are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
in the company entered into an interest rate swap see note to the company s financial statements which it has elected not to account for as a cash flow hedge under the provisions of sfas no 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risk  including the effects of adverse changes in metal prices and interest rates as discussed below 
commodity price risk the company produces and sells palladium  platinum and associated by product metals directly to its customers and also through third parties 
as a result  financial performance can be materially affected when prices for these commodities fluctuate 
in order to manage commodity price risk and to reduce the impact of fluctuation in prices  the company enters into long term contracts and from time to time uses various derivative financial instruments 
because the company hedges only with instruments that have a high correlation with the value of the hedged transactions  changes in the fair value of the derivatives are expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the value of the hedged transaction 
the company has entered into long term sales contracts with general motors corporation  ford motor company and mitsubishi corporation 
the mitsubishi sales agreement expired at december   but a significant share of the pgm volumes previously committed to mitsubishi will be assumed under the provisions of the remaining contracts 
the contracts together cover significant portions of the company s mined pgm production through december and stipulate floor and ceiling prices for some of the covered production 
in the first quarter of the company also entered into three new sales contracts under which palladium quantities equal to the  ounces of palladium received in the norilsk nickel stock purchase transaction were sold over a period of two years  primarily for use in automobile catalytic converters 
under these agreements  the company sold approximately  ounces of palladium per month  ending in the first quarter of  at a slight volume discount to the market price at the time of delivery 
under one of these agreements  the company also delivered for sale  ounces of platinum and  ounces of rhodium per month also at a slight discount to market prices 
the company from time to time purchased platinum and rhodium in the open market for resale under this monthly delivery obligation 
see business and properties pgm sales and hedging activities and note to the company s financial statements for a more detailed discussion of the company s open positions 
beginning in the third quarter of  the major us bond rating agencies successively downgraded the corporate ratings of general motors corporation and ford motor company  two of the customers pursuant to the company s long term sales contracts 
as a result  the debt of these companies no longer qualifies as investment grade 
the company s business is substantially dependent on its contracts with ford and general motors  particularly because the floor prices in these contracts provide significant price protection to the company in periods of low palladium prices 
under applicable law  these contracts may be void or voidable if general motors or ford becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy 
the loss of either of these contracts could require the company to sell at prevailing market prices  which might expose it to lower metal prices as compared to the floor prices under the contracts 
in such an event  the company s operating plans could be threatened 
in addition  under the company s credit facility  a default or modification of these contracts could prohibit additional loans or require the immediate repayment of outstanding loans 
thus  termination of these contracts could have a material adverse impact on the company s operations and viability 
the company from time to time enters into fixed forward sales and financially settled forward transactions that may be accounted for as cash flow hedges to hedge the price risk in its pgm recycling and mine production activities 
in the fixed forward transactions  normally metals contained in the spent catalytic materials are sold forward at the time the materials are received and are delivered against the fixed forward contracts when the finished ounces are recovered 
the company accounted for such fixed forwards as cash flow hedges for transactions entered into prior to april   thereafter the company has elected to account for these transactions using the normal purchase and normal sales provisions contained in sfas no 
financially settled forwards may be used as a mechanism to hedge against fluctuations in metal prices associated with future production 
generally  the company accounts for financial settled forward transactions as cash flow hedges 
under financially settled forwards  at each settlement date  the company receives the difference between the forward price and the market price if the market price is below the forward price  and the company pays the difference between the forward price and the market price if the market price is above the forward price 
the company s financially settled forwards are settled at maturity 

table of contents as of december   the company was party to financially settled forward agreements covering over half of its anticipated platinum sales from mine production for the period from january through june these transactions are designed to hedge a total of  ounces of platinum sales from mine production for the next eighteen months at an overall average price of approximately per ounce 
until these contracts mature  any net change in the value of the hedging instrument due to changes in metal prices is reflected in stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income 
a net unrealized loss of million on these instruments existed at december   and is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss see note to the company s financial statements 
because these hedges are highly effective  when these instruments are settled any remaining gain or loss on the cash flow hedges will be offset by losses or gains on the future metal sale and will be recognized at that time in operating income 
all commodity instruments outstanding at december   are expected to be settled within the next eighteen months

price first quarter these hedges are intended to provide some financial protection against a period of low commodity prices 
because they cover only a portion of the company s production for a limited period  they do not eliminate the risk of an extended period of low prices 
a period of continuous low commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on the calculation of the company s ore reserves as well as on the company s financial performance 
interest rate risk as of december   the company had million outstanding under its million term loan facility  bearing interest at a variable rate of based upon libor at december  plus a margin see note to the company s financial statements 
at the current libor  this represents an interest cost of approximately million per year 
although the margin on this debt is fixed  the libor is subject to short term fluctuations in market interest rates 
each increase in libor increases the company s estimated annual interest cost by approximately million
