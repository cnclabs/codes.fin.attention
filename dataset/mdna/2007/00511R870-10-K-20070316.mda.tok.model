the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company that develops new drugs and improved formulations of existing drugs using our proprietary porous microparticle technology 
we are focused on developing proprietary drugs that can offer significant benefits such as improved safety and efficacy  increased patient compliance  greater ease of use  expanded indications or reduced cost 
our lead product candidate imagify perflubutane polymer microspheres  formerly known as ai is a cardiovascular drug in phase clinical development for the detection of coronary artery disease  the leading cause of death in the united states 
we also have demonstrated that our technology can improve the formulation of hydrophobic drugs and asthma drugs 
our proprietary technology enables us to control the size and porosity of particles  including nanoparticles and microparticles  in a versatile manner  so we can customize the particles to address the delivery needs of a variety of drugs 
we are focused on creating porous microparticles that are smaller than red blood cells 
some of these microparticles are nanoparticles which are smaller than micron 
small microparticles are important for delivering drugs intravenously so that they can pass through the body s smallest blood vessels  for increasing the surface area of a drug so that the drug will dissolve more rapidly  and for delivering drugs to the lung via inhalation 
porosity is important for entrapping gases in microparticles  for controlling the release rate of the drug from a microparticle  and for targeting inhaled drugs to specific regions of the lung 
we have incurred significant operating losses to develop our product candidates and we anticipate continuing to incur significant operating losses in the coming years 
in particular  we expect to incur significant additional expenses and experience other significant capital requirements to conduct our phase clinical program for imagify and to complete the build out and qualification of a manufacturing facility for the initial commercial manufacture of imagify 
since our inception  we have funded our operations primarily through private and public placements of equity securities  equipment backed financings and other debt financings 
imagify phase clinical trial our phase clinical plan provides for a two part program consisting of a pilot phase  under which new investigators and blinded readers have been qualified and trained  and two independent multi center pivotal trials 
these two pivotal trials  previously referred to as the and trials  have been re named ramp and ramp  respectively 
ramp stands for real time assessment of myocardial perfusion with echocardiography 
clinical investigators were qualified in the pilot phase on a rolling basis 
the pilot phase was completed in clinical investigators in the phase pivotal studies are located at clinical sites in north america  europe and australia 
data from the phase pivotal studies are intended for submission to us  european  and potentially other regulatory authorities 
the pivotal trials 
the phase pivotal studies are designed to demonstrate that imagify enhanced cardiac stress ultrasound is non inferior to nuclear stress testing 
clinical sites that participated in these studies were primarily in the us and europe 
all patients enrolled in these studies received an imagify enhanced cardiac stress ultrasound 
most of these patients also received a nuclear stress test 
the imagify enhanced cardiac stress ultrasound images and the nuclear stress images resulting from these studies are forwarded by the clinical sites to an independent clinical research organization where all information about the patients  other than what is shown by the images themselves  is removed 
because all such patient information is removed from the images  evaluators of the images are referred to as blinded readers 
images produced by imagify enhanced stress echo are evaluated by echocardiologists  who we refer to as ultrasound blinded readers 
images produced by nuclear stress tests are evaluated by nuclear cardiologists  who we refer to as nuclear blinded readers 
a truth standard defines which patients have disease and which patients are normal  and serves as the basis for quantifying the performance of the ultrasound blinded readers and the performance of the nuclear blinded readers 
non inferiority is determined by comparing the performance of the ultrasound blinded read relative to the nuclear blinded read 
non inferiority of imagify enhanced cardiac stress ultrasound relative to nuclear stress is evaluated in three ways  which are the primary endpoints of the pivotal trials 
first  non inferiority is evaluated in all patients 
we define accuracy as a measure of the percentage of patients in which the test is correct relative to the truth standard 
next  non inferiority is evaluated in two different subsets of patients  those with disease and those without disease 
we define sensitivity as a measure of the effectiveness of the test in assessing the presence of disease in the patients who have been shown by the truth standard as having coronary artery disease and specificity as a measure of the effectiveness of the test in assessing the absence of disease in the patients who have been shown by the truth standard to be free of coronary artery disease 
during the pivotal trials  we intentionally have no access to efficacy data 
we do not publicly disclose results from a pivotal trial until after the trial is closed  quality control checks are completed  the database is locked  the data are revealed to us and we have had an opportunity to review and understand the data  including data regarding clinical outcomes and safety results 
a total of patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease have been enrolled in the phase pivotal trials 
ramp trial 
patients were enrolled in the ramp clinical trial 
patients eligible for this trial had  in accordance with current clinical practice  been referred for a nuclear stress test 
all ramp patients received an imagify enhanced cardiac stress ultrasound as well as a nuclear stress test 
the truth standard in this trial was angiography  clinical outcome or clinical outcome with the unblinded evaluation of the nuclear stress test 
the truth standard was angiography in of patients 
in june we announced preliminary results of the ramp study 
the accuracy and specificity results exceeded the criteria for success 
three of three ultrasound blinded readers had statistically non inferior accuracy to the nuclear blinded reader  whose accuracy was all p value 
two of three ultrasound blinded readers had statistically superior specificity to the nuclear blinded reader  whose specificity was p value for both with respect to non inferiority 
the sensitivity results missed the criteria for success of the trial with one of three ultrasound blinded readers having statistical non inferior sensitivity p to the nuclear blinded reader s sensitivity of 
based upon our review of the safety data from this trial  we believe imagify was well tolerated 
greater than of the images acquired from patients enrolled in the trial were evaluable 
the majority of adverse events  or aes  reported were mild in intensity  transient  and resolved without residual effects 
the most common aes reported were headache  chest pain  nausea  flushing and dizziness and the majority of these aes occurred following the administration of the dipyridamole pharmacologic stress agent prior to stress imaging 
serious adverse events  or saes  and dose discontinuation was experienced in four and five of patients  respectively 
all saes were non life threatening  transient  and resolved without residual effects 
ramp trial 
in june we completed the enrollment of patients in this trial 
patients eligible for this trial had been referred for a coronary angiogram 
all patients enrolled in this clinical trial received an imagify enhanced cardiac stress ultrasound 
approximately patients also received a nuclear stress test for purposes of evaluation against the primary endpoints of this study 
the truth standard for patients in this study is coronary angiography 
as dictated by the trial design  all patients in this trial were evaluated for up to days following the imagify enhanced cardiac stress ultrasound 
once all images have been read  and all patient data from the follow up period and angiography data are collected  an independent third party clinical research organization  on our behalf  will conduct quality control checks 
these checks  which can take up to days  are designed to ensure that all of the required information has been fully gathered and filed before locking the database 
at that time  the data may be unblinded and made available to us for analysis 
in october  we completed an initiative designed to train all of the ultrasound blinded readers in the ramp trial to increase their sensitivity while maintaining high accuracy 
we continue to train the ultrasound blinded readers in an effort to assure that gains in sensitivity do not lower specificity below targeted levels 
based upon our findings from this training  we intend to have each of the ramp ultrasound blinded readers evaluate all images for the primary efficacy analysis of the ramp trial 
although this training and each of the other differences referred to above are intended to increase the likelihood of success for the ramp trial  we cannot assure you that the ramp results will meet or exceed the clinical endpoints 
we currently expect that the results from ramp will be publicly available in the second quarter of  and that the nda submission will occur in the fourth quarter of no additional patients are expected to be enrolled in the ramp study 
trial design and purpose 
we believe that imagify enhanced cardiac stress ultrasound has the potential to significantly reduce the time  cost and resources needed in the assessment of myocardial perfusion  compared to nuclear stress testing 
myocardial perfusion is blood flow to the heart muscle  a sensitive marker for coronary artery disease 
there is no ultrasound contrast agent currently approved by fda for use in cardiac ultrasound of myocardial perfusion imaging 
based upon the endpoints described above  our ramp and ramp trials are designed to demonstrate non inferiority of imagify enhanced cardiac stress ultrasound relative to nuclear stress testing 
in april  based in part upon feedback from fda  we revised the statistical analysis plan on which we base our patient enrollment estimates for the imagify phase clinical trials 
since that time we have continued discussions with fda regarding trial design and our statistical analysis plan 
as a result of our ongoing discussions with fda  we may make further revisions 
these discussions could lead to delays in the public announcement of the results from our ramp clinical trial and affect whether imagify is approved for the indication that we are seeking  the timing of such approval or whether imagify is approved at all 
the discussion of our training efforts in the ramp trial  and the estimates of and timing of blinded reads  data lock  data release and nda submission in our phase trials reflect our current assumptions  based on our knowledge and experience and the guidance of our advisors 
we cannot assure you that these timelines will be met  nor can we assure you that our estimates and assumptions will not change based upon ongoing regulatory feedback or that  when the ramp trial is completed  we will successfully achieve results that meet or exceed the clinical endpoints or that fda will accept and approve our nda once submitted 
imagify manufacturing facility update prior to filing an nda for imagify  we must demonstrate that we can successfully and repeatedly manufacture imagify in compliance with current good manufacturing practices  or cgmps  enforced by fda and overseas regulatory agencies in the manufacturing facility that we intend to use to produce imagify at commercial launch 
in july  we entered into a lease agreement for  square feet of commercial manufacturing space in tewksbury  massachusetts 
in late  we substantially completed the build out of this facility and commenced start up activities relating to the manufacturing equipment installed at the site 
in early we completed commissioning of the manufacturing equipment and utilities within the facility  in mid we produced full commercial scale development batches of imagify in this facility and in late we substantially completed all installation qualification  or iq  and operational qualification  or oq  requirements relating to the equipment and utilities initially needed for this facility 
remaining steps to qualification of the manufacturing facility include  aseptic validation  process qualification and completion of product stability testing 
all such qualification activities need to be completed under cgmps 
data from the production of imagify under cgmps is intended to be part of our nda submission of imagify 
based upon our current plans  we expect to complete this qualification phase in time to support a nda submission in the fourth quarter of we believe that our existing facilities  subject to the successful qualification of the commercial manufacturing facility in tewksbury  massachusetts  are adequate to meet our current and initial commercial requirements and that suitable additional space will be available as needed 
in support of our efforts to qualify our commercial manufacturing facility for imagify  in february  we and nycomed agreed to amend the strategic collaboration agreement resulting in commitment by nycomed to accelerate million in payments to us in order to fund certain activities associated with the qualification of our manufacturing facility 
during we received the full million in payments from nycomed 
although the qualification of the commercial manufacturing facility has completed iq s and oq s  we cannot assure you that we will not encounter complications in the qualification of operations in this facility which complications could add additional costs or delay our filing of a nda for imagify 
european collaboration agreement in july  we entered into a collaboration  license and supply agreement with nycomed pursuant to which we granted nycomed rights to develop and market imagify in europe 
as part of the agreement  nycomed has agreed to provide up to million in license fees  research and development funding  and milestone payments  including million in payments over the first two years  of which the final million was paid to us in april the remaining million in milestone payments are related to regulatory approvals and achievement of certain sales goals 
in addition  nycomed has agreed to pay us to manufacture imagify for them and to pay us royalties on nycomed s sales of imagify 
nycomed will be responsible for sales  marketing and the regulatory submissions required for marketing throughout its sales territory  which includes the member states of the european union  as well as russia cis and turkey 
in october  we and nycomed agreed to amend the strategic collaboration agreement in order to accelerate million in milestone payments to support activities associated with imagify brand development  including related international trademark activities 
in february  we and nycomed further amended the agreement to accelerate million in milestone payments in order to fund certain activities associated with the qualification of our manufacturing facility  as discussed above 
the payments received pursuant to these amendments are considered advances against a future milestone payment for a european regulatory filing  or marketing authorization application  or maa  and will be deducted from that milestone payment 
payments received under these amendments will be classified as deferred revenue until the maa milestone is achieved  provided that the applicable revenue recognition criteria are met 
as of december  we have received the entire million in payments from nycomed and have included this amount in deferred revenue 
the nycomed agreement is subject to termination provisions 
under certain of these termination provisions  if we fail in any material respect to use all commercially reasonable efforts to carry out referenced obligations under the agreement  we would be obligated to pay nycomed liquidated damages of up to million 
we plan to carry out all of these obligations  which we believe are in our control 
however  there can be no assurance that termination of this agreement will not occur or that such termination would not result in us incurring liquidated damages of up to million 
financial operations overview revenue 
we have not generated any revenue from product sales since our inception 
since july  when we entered into our collaboration agreement with nycomed  the majority of our revenue has been collaboration revenue recognized in connection with research and development activities performed under this agreement 
as of december  nycomed has paid us million in license fees for our research and development efforts 
we are recognizing this million of initial license and research and development payments ratably over a period currently estimated at months 
the length of this research and development period  which is the period over which we are obligated to perform services  is estimated based on available facts and circumstances 
we periodically evaluate the assumptions underlying our estimate and change our estimate when appropriate 
further in the future  we will seek to generate revenue from a combination of product sales  up front or milestone payments and manufacturing payments in connection with collaborative or strategic relationships  and royalties resulting from the license of our products and intellectual property 
research and development expense 
research and development expense consists of expenses incurred in developing  manufacturing and testing product candidates 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  fees paid to professional service providers in conjunction with independently monitoring our clinical trials and acquiring and evaluating data in conjunction with our clinical trials  costs of materials used in clinical trials and research and development  depreciation of capital resources used to develop our products  costs of facilities  the legal costs of pursuing patent protection on select elements of our intellectual property  costs for intellectual property rights we have acquired or licensed and stock based compensation 
we expense research and development costs  including patent related costs  as incurred 
we believe that significant investment in product development is a competitive necessity and plan to continue these investments in order to realize the potential of our product candidates and proprietary technologies 
development programs for later stage product candidates  such as imagify  tend to cost more than earlier stage programs due to the length and the number of patients enrolled in clinical trials for later stage programs and due to costs of scaling production to commercial scale 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  information technology  business development and human resource functions 
other costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expense  professional fees for legal and accounting services and stock based compensation 
in addition  we categorize our market research and other marketing type costs as general and administrative expense because we have not yet obtained approval to market or sell our product candidates 
interest income 
interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents 
interest expense 
interest expense consists of interest incurred on equipment leases and other financing arrangements 
interest expense also includes interest recognized in connection with embedded derivatives 
change in valuation of derivative 
the terms of our february convertible preferred stock offering and our march mass development loan agreement contain features considered to be embedded derivatives which are recorded at estimated fair value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments sfas 
change in valuation of derivative consists of other income expense recognized on the change in fair value of the derivative at the end of each reporting period 
the change in the value of the derivative related to the preferred stock is affected by a number of assumptions including the number of preferred shares outstanding  the amount of dividends paid and the probability and timing of conversion into common stock 
the derivative liability is reduced for any make whole payments made during the period upon conversions of preferred stock to common stock 
the change in the value of the derivative related to the loan is affected by the expected timing of future positive net cash flows from operations 
dividends on preferred stock 
for the years ended december  and  dividends on preferred stock consisted of dividends paid or accumulated on the convertible exchangeable preferred stock which we issued in february dividends on preferred stock exclude any make whole payments on conversion of preferred stock to common stock 
dividends on our preferred stock are cumulative from the date of original issue at the annual rate of per share  payable quarterly on the first day of march  june  september  and december 
any dividend payment must be declared by our board of directors and must come from funds that are legally available for dividend payments 
results of operations revenue versus in connection with our collaboration agreement with nycomed entered into in july  nycomed has paid us million in license fees for our research and development efforts 
we had previously been recognizing this million in research and development payments ratably over the estimated development period  as defined  of months 
estimation of this development period involves the evaluation of many assumptions and uncertainties inherent in the performance of a long term development project 
we regularly evaluate these assumptions and uncertainties and our estimated development recognition period may change if facts and circumstances change 
we reevaluated the assumptions underlying the development term and during  and modified our estimate of the development period over which we are obligated to perform services to months 
collaboration revenue recognized under this agreement was million for the year ended december  versus million in and million in in addition to our nycomed collaboration revenue  during we recognized revenue of approximately million upon the completion of a feasibility study utilizing our hdds technology and through performance of certain services on a time and material basis 
versus revenue recognized under the collaboration agreement with nycomed was million for the year ended december  versus million during the increase was due to twelve months of revenue recognized during  versus six months of revenue recognized during  since the collaboration agreement began in july research and development expense versus research and development expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
the increase was primarily due to an increase of million for depreciation  primarily associated with our commercial manufacturing facility which went into service for accounting purposes in october and an increase of million related to the licensing of intellectual property 
the increase in intellectual property expense resulted from a million charge in for the present value of non contingent payments made  or schedule to be made  under the ge and bracco agreements 
we expensed the cost of these intellectual property rights because  for accounting purposes  we have not demonstrated technological feasibility or an alternative use for the rights acquired 
direct research and development expense in decreased million versus the prior year 
these costs include clinical trial expenses as well as expenses associated with the qualification of our commercial manufacturing facility 
this decrease in direct costs was primarily due to a decrease in clinical costs  of which million was in consulting and contract services reflecting the completion of ramp enrollment in december and ramp enrollment in june however  as costs associated with clinical data management and evaluation decreased in versus  overall costs associated with qualification of our commercial manufacturing facility for imagify increased million  offsetting this clinical expense reduction 
versus research and development expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
included in the increase in research and development expense in is million that we expensed in connection with our acquisition of patents from schering 
the remaining million increase during in research and development expense was primarily due to a million increase in direct costs  including a million increase in salaries related to increased staffing levels  a million increase in consulting and contract services and a million increase in materials and supplies 
these increases are primarily due to activities relating to imagify  including increased phase clinical program costs and increased costs associated with preparing for commercial manufacturing of imagify 
the increases reflect costs associated with a higher number of clinical sites enrolling patients in the imagify phase clinical program  a higher rate of patient enrollment in these clinical trials and related increases in costs for clinical data management and independent clinical site monitoring 
the increase in research and development costs also includes increased costs associated with increasing full and part time personnel and operating costs associated with efforts to build out and qualify a commercial manufacturing facility for imagify 
the higher research and development expense in compared to primarily resulted from increased activities in the imagify phase clinical program  including clinical site costs  data management costs  independent monitoring costs and costs of manufacturing clinical materials 
the increase in research and development costs also includes costs associated with increasing full and part time personnel 
the increase in research and development costs in compared to also includes increases in indirect costs 
these increases included a million charge under the schering patent transfer agreement and increased facility and depreciation costs resulting primarily from the lease agreement entered into in our commercial manufacturing facility in tewksbury  massachusetts and the depreciation of improvements to that facility and equipment installed in that facility the majority of which went into service in october research and development expense components the following table summarizes the primary components of our research and development expense for the years ended december   and years ended december  in thousands imagify hdds and pdds other direct costs total direct costs indirect costs facility rent costs depreciation stock based compensation patent acquisition licensing other patent costs total indirect costs total research and development expense we expect overall research and development expenses in to be lower than  primarily because we do not anticipate entering into any new agreements to license or acquire additional intellectual property rights relating to imagify which agreements resulted in million in expense in late stage clinical development program imagify 
our lead product candidate  imagify  is a cardiovascular drug designed for the detection of coronary artery disease 
direct expense for research and development of imagify was million in  million in  and million in of these amounts  million in  million in and million in were from manufacturing related activities and manufacturing facility qualification 
the primary contributor to the overall decrease in compared to with respect to direct costs related to imagify research and development was lower clinical costs from the timing of patient enrollment 
patient enrollment in the phase clinical program for imagify declined in as we completed enrollment in the ramp trial in december and in the ramp trial in june however  as costs associated with clinical data management and evaluation decreased in versus  overall costs associated with our commercial manufacturing facility for imagify increased  offsetting this clinical expense reduction 
in compared to  clinical trial enrollment increased resulting in higher direct expense in than for imagify research and development 
early stage clinical development programs hdds and pdds 
our initial clinical applications of our hdds technology  ai  and our pdds technology  ai  have each completed a phase trial 
in we completed our portion of a feasibility study regarding the use of our hdds technology in connection with a product candidate under development by a large pharmaceutical company 
potential expansion of this collaboration is pending the completion of a review by that pharmaceutical company 
while we have given spending priority to imagify  we continue to evaluate our hdds and pdds opportunities  including potential opportunities with partners  the product candidates referenced above and other potential product candidates 
during  we anticipate the costs of early stage development programs to increase as we increase our focus on development of new product candidates 
however  because these programs are in relatively early stages of development  we anticipate that costs related to imagify will continue to represent our primary research and development expenditures through other costs 
other direct research and development costs primarily consist of management and preclinical evaluation of other product candidates 
each of our research and development programs is subject to risks and uncertainties  including the requirement to seek regulatory approvals  which are outside of our control 
for example  our clinical trials may be subject to delays or rejections based on our inability to enroll patients at the rate that we expect or our inability to produce clinical trial material in sufficient quantities and of sufficient quality to meet the schedule for our planned clinical trials 
moreover  the product candidates identified in these research and development programs  particularly our early stage programs  must overcome significant technological  manufacturing and marketing challenges before they can be successfully commercialized 
as a result of these risks and uncertainties  we are unable to predict with any certainty the period in which material net cash inflows from such projects could be expected to commence or the completion date of these programs 
failure to commercialize these product candidates on a timely basis could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may seek to establish collaborative relationships to help us commercialize these product candidates  but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so 
general and administrative expense versus general and administrative expense in the year ended december  was million versus million in  an increase of million  or 
the primary components of the increase to general and administrative expenses were increased costs for market research and business development activities and higher staffing levels primarily from the addition of marketing personnel 
in addition  million of this increase related to stock based compensation expense from the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment fas r 
versus general and administrative expense in the year ended december  was million versus million in  an increase of million  or

the derivative is related to the embedded derivative instrument from the dividend make whole payment feature of the preferred stock offering that closed in february the change in valuation of derivative amounted to million in and million in the derivative liability value is reduced as dividends payments on the preferred stock are made  as well as for any conversions of preferred stock into common stock 
during april  we distributed  shares of our common stock with a fair value of million in satisfaction of the make whole provision related to the conversion of  shares of preferred stock into common stock 
during  we distributed  shares of our common stock with a fair value of million in satisfaction of the make whole provision related to the conversion of  shares of preferred stock into common stock 
effect of preferred stock on loss available to common stockholders 
our net loss available to common stockholders includes dividends paid as well as dividends accumulated on preferred stock 
the accumulated portion represents one month of dividend accumulated but not declared as of the end of the period 
this amount of dividends accumulated is included in the calculation of per share net loss available to common stockholders 
dividends paid or accumulated on preferred stock totaled million in and preferred stock dividends result from the issuance on february  of  shares of exchangeable preferred stock 
dividends paid in cash to holders of this preferred stock during and totaled million and million  respectively 
during and  voluntary conversions of shares of preferred stock into common stock totaled  and  respectively  resulting in an outstanding balance of preferred stock at december  and of  and  shares  respectively 
in february  the board of directors declared a dividend on the shares of preferred stock outstanding as of february  this dividend  which totaled million  was paid on march  in addition to dividends paid on preferred stock  the calculation of per share net loss available to common stockholders includes million of dividends accumulated on preferred stock representing one month of dividend accumulated but not declared as of december  liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our business through the issuance of equity securities  debt financings and equipment leases and  more recently  with funds from our collaboration with nycomed 
our liquidity requirements have arisen primarily from research and development expenditures  equipment expenditures and payments on outstanding indebtedness 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
as of december  we owed million from capital leases and million from notes payable and other long term obligations 
we also had operating lease commitments totaling million for rent of our facilities 
during the year ended december   operating activities used million of cash 
net cash used by operating activities during this period resulted primarily from a net loss of million and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million 
these uses of cash were partially offset by non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of million  non cash charges for stock based compensation of million and an increase in deferred revenue of million 
we estimate that quarterly cash spending from operating activities will be approximately to million in the first half of including spending necessary to complete the ramp blinded reads 
in addition  we anticipate net quarterly payments of approximately million per quarter for repayment of debt related to prior equipment purchases and capital leases and quarterly payments of approximately million per quarter for payment of dividends on outstanding preferred stock 
we are scheduled to make payments of million and million  respectively  in connection with the intellectual property agreements that we have entered into with schering and ge 
assuming favorable ramp results  we anticipate that our rate of quarterly cash spending from operating activities in the second half of could increase to to million as we prepare for commercialization of imagify and advance other potential product candidates 
during the year ended december   investing activities used million in cash 
this use of cash was primarily used for purchases of equipment incurred in connection with our commercial manufacturing facility for imagify 
we anticipate that our capital expenditures during the first half of will average less than million per quarter 
capital expenditures in the second half of could average between and million per quarter depending upon the results from our ramp clinical trial or changes in other assumptions used in our plans 
we will continue to seek debt financing for such purchases 
during the year ended december   financing activities provided million in cash 
net cash provided by financing activities during this period resulted primarily from the net proceeds of a common stock and warrant financing in april of million and the net proceeds of a common stock and warrant financing in december of million 
these funding activities were partially offset by payments in on long term obligations of million and the payment of dividends on the redeemable convertible preferred stock of million 
on december   we sold  units consisting of i one share of common stock and ii one warrant to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share  for a purchase price of per unit  resulting in aggregate gross proceeds to us of million net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 
units are not issued or certificated 
the shares of common stock and warrants are immediately separable and will be issued separately 
the warrants will be exercisable beginning on june  and until december  effective june   we entered into a promissory note with general electric capital corporation  or ge capital  in aggregate original principal amount totaling million for equipment already purchased by us 
the promissory note includes an annual interest rate of and is payable over consecutive months 
the promissory note is secured by the financed equipment pursuant to the terms of our master security agreement with ge capital 
the promissory note is subject to acceleration upon the happening of customary events of default  including the failure to make timely payments of principal and interest 
effective june   we entered into an agreement to license on a non exclusive basis various ultrasound related intellectual property from ge healthcare  or ge  a division of general electric company 
the agreement provides us with use of ge s ultrasound contrast agent patents and patent applications in combination with our lead product candidate imagify in the field of ultrasound contrast agents  as well as any patents that ge acquires in the field within months of the agreement 
in consideration of the non exclusive license of these patents  we agreed to pay ge million prior to commercial approval of imagify  of which million was paid in june and million is due in june in addition  we agreed to pay ge million upon the commercial approval defined as the first to occur of the approval of a new drug application in the united states or the approval of a marketing authorization application in europe of imagify and million upon the one year anniversary of such commercial approval 
the latter two million payments are contingent upon achievement of future milestone events and  accordingly  have not been recorded at this time 
also effective june   we entered into an agreement to license on a non exclusive basis various ultrasound related intellectual property from bracco international bv  or bracco 
the agreement provides us with use of bracco s ultrasound related patents and patent applications in combination with our lead product candidate imagify in the field of ultrasound diagnostic imaging 
in consideration the non exclusive license of these patents  we agreed to pay bracco up to a total royalty of euros million  of which euros million approximately million at september  was paid in june an additional euros million is payable upon our achievement of certain defined regulatory milestones 
we also agreed to pay a royalty on future imagify revenue  up to a maximum royalty amount of euros million  less a portion of the above referenced milestone payments 
whereas the other obligations are contingent upon the outcome of future events  they have not been recorded at this time 
on april   we sold  units  each unit consisting of i one share of common stock and ii one warrant to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share  for a purchase price of per unit  resulting in aggregate gross proceeds to us of million net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 
units are not issued or certificated 
the shares of common stock and warrants were immediately separable and were issued separately 
the warrants were exercisable beginning on october  and until april  in september  we sold  shares of common stock at per share resulting in net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses 
in june  we entered into a equipment financing line with oxford finance corporation  or oxford 
in and  we borrowed an aggregate of million against this line 
as of december   net of repayments  we had million outstanding under this line 
such borrowings are collateralized by corresponding equipment and other capital purchases with repayment due in monthly installments over to months  depending on the nature of the equipment financed  with the last such repayment scheduled for march interest rates on these borrowings were fixed at the time of each borrowing and range from to loan amounts are subject to acceleration upon the happening of certain customary events of default including failure to timely pay principal and interest 
in march  we borrowed million under a loan agreement with massdevelopment to help finance certain tenant improvements to our commercial manufacturing facility in tewksbury  massachusetts 
interest accrues under the loan at per annum with retroactive adjustments to upon our reaching certain defined earning levels 
the repayment of principal and accrued interest will coincide with the term of the tewksbury lease which has a five year  nine month term with options to extend the lease for up to two additional five year terms 
no payments were due under the loan for the first months and we are scheduled to begin repayments on this loan in may unpaid interest during this twenty four month period shall be accrued and principal and interest shall be repaid on a monthly basis thereafter such that the total amount outstanding shall fully amortize over the balance of the term in equal installments 
the loan is subject to acceleration upon certain customary events of default  including failure to timely pay principal and interest 
the loan is secured by certain of the tenant improvements made at the tewksbury facility 
in february  we issued  shares of convertible exchangeable preferred stock  our preferred stock  at per share resulting in net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses 
each share of preferred stock has a liquidation preference of per share 
dividends on the preferred stock are cumulative from the date of original issue at the annual rate of per share  payable quarterly on the first day of march  june  september  and december 
any dividends must be declared by our board of directors and must come from funds that are legally available for dividend payments 
during and  we paid and million  respectively  in dividends on our preferred stock 
as of december    shares of preferred stock were outstanding 
in february  our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend on the preferred stock for all holders as of february  this dividend  which totaled million in aggregate  was paid on march  we may elect to automatically convert some or all of the preferred stock into shares of our common stock if the closing price of our common stock has exceeded per share of the conversion price for at least trading days during any day trading period  ending within five trading days prior to notice of automatic conversion 
prior to march   if we elect to automatically convert  or if any holder elects to voluntarily convert  the preferred stock  we will also make an additional payment  the make whole payment  equal to the aggregate amount of dividends that would have been payable on the preferred stock so converted from the original date of issuance through and including march   less any dividends already paid on the preferred stock 
this additional payment is payable by us  at our option  in cash  in additional shares of its common stock  or in a combination of cash and shares of common stock 
we have reserved a maximum of approximately  shares of common stock for issuance under this make whole provision 
during and   and  shares  respectively  of preferred stock were voluntarily converted into  and  shares  respectively  of our common stock 
in addition  in connection with these conversions we issued  and  shares  respectively  of our common stock in satisfaction of the required make whole payment 
we may elect to redeem the preferred stock at declining redemption prices on or after march  the preferred stock is exchangeable  in whole but not in part  at our option on any dividend payment date beginning on the exchange date march  for our convertible subordinated debentures  or the debentures  at the rate of principal amount of debentures for each share of preferred stock 
the debentures  if issued  will mature years after the exchange date and have terms substantially similar to those of the preferred stock 
in april  we entered into an equipment financing line with general electric capital corporation 
in and  we borrowed an aggregate of million against this line 
as of december   net of repayments  we had million outstanding under this line 
in january  the line was amended and the availability was increased by an additional million and was extended through may during  we borrowed approximately million and have approximately million  of this million available at december  such borrowings are collateralized by corresponding equipment and other capital purchases with repayment due in monthly installments over to months  depending on the nature of the equipment financed  with the last such repayment scheduled for january interest rates on these borrowings were fixed at the time of each borrowing and range from to 
the loans under this line are subject to acceleration upon the happening of certain customary events of default  including failure to timely pay principal and interest 
in july  we entered into a collaboration  license and supply agreement with nycomed in which we granted nycomed rights to develop and market imagify in europe 
under the original terms of this agreement  nycomed paid us license fees and research and development payments totaling million in  million in and million in the original agreement also provides for nycomed to pay to us up to million in milestone payments upon achievement of certain regulatory milestones and sales goals 
under the agreement  nycomed has agreed to pay us to manufacture imagify for them and to pay us royalties on nycomed s sales of imagify 
in october  our agreement with nycomed was amended such that nycomed paid us an additional million in for activities associated with creating a brand name for imagify and related trademark activities which amount decreased by million the potential in milestone payments which may be earned under the agreement 
in february  we and nycomed agreed to further amend the agreement to accelerate million in milestone payments in order to fund certain activities associated with the qualification of our manufacturing facility in tewksbury  massachusetts 
we received this million in as the qualification costs were incurred 
payments received pursuant to these amendments are considered advances against a future milestone payment for a european regulatory filing  or maa  and are deducted from that milestone payment 
in connection with our original agreement with nycomed  we are obligated to pay a customary fee to our financial advisor 
the fee is comprised of cash and warrants 
the total amount of cash payments is dependent upon the timing and magnitude of the amounts paid to us by nycomed 
in  and  we paid our advisor   and  respectively 
on november   in connection with the nycomed transaction  we issued a warrant to our financial advisor to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
in july  we entered into a lease agreement for  square feet of commercial manufacturing space in tewksbury  massachusetts 
this lease has a five year  nine month term with options to extend the lease for up to two additional five year terms at predetermined rental rates 
initially  we received nine months of occupancy free of base rent  followed by base rent of approximately million for the next twelve months with scheduled annual rental rate increases thereafter 
in august  we entered into a million loan agreement with the massachusetts development finance agency  the economic development authority of the commonwealth of massachusetts  to help fund tenant improvements to the tewksbury facility 
financing is available under this loan agreement upon completion by us of certain tenant improvements to the tewksbury facility 
the term of this facility  if utilized  is expected to coincide with the term of the tewksbury lease 
we believe  based on our operating plans  that our existing resources  excluding potential proceeds from the equity line financing available to us effective august  will be adequate to fund our planned operations  including spending necessary to complete the blinded reads of the ramp results  into early  or longer if we elect to reduce our rate of spending 
unless we reduce our current rate of spending  we will require significant additional funds  which we may raise through public or private sales of equity  or from borrowings  or from strategic partners 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the scope and progress made in our research and development activities and our clinical trials and the size and timing of creating expanded manufacturing capabilities 
we may also need additional funds for possible future strategic acquisitions of businesses  patent licenses  products or technologies complementary to our business 
we do not expect to generate significant revenues from imagify  other than possible license or milestone payments  unless or until we or current or potential partners complete clinical trials and receive marketing approval from the applicable regulatory authorities 
allowing our resources to become depleted may make future funding more difficult or expensive 
when additional funds are required or  in advance of such requirements  we anticipate that funds will be needed  we may raise such funds from time to time through public or private sales of equity or from borrowings or from strategic partners or we may delay funding of certain development activities which could delay the filing of our imagify nda and the commercialization of imagify which would have a materially adverse impact on our growth plans 
we are evaluating our funding alternatives  additional equity financing may be dilutive to our stockholders  debt financing  if available  may involve significant cash payment obligations and covenants that restrict our ability to operate as a business  and strategic partnerships may result in royalties or other terms which reduce our economic potential from products under development 
shelf registration statement we have on file with the us securities and exchange commission  or sec  a universal shelf registration statement on form s registration no 
and a universal shelf registration statement on form s registration no 
 which provide for the offer  from time to time  of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities and warrants up to an aggregate remaining availability of approximately million and million  respectively  net of financing amounts previously executed under these registration statements and amounts reserved for up to million in potential financing under the equity line of credit arrangement we entered into in august with azimuth opportunity  ltd 
the sec declared the shelf registration statements effective on june  and april   respectively 
subject to market conditions and our capital needs  and so long as we are then eligible to use the registration statements under sec rules  we may again seek to use any remaining availability under the shelf registration statements by making an offering of securities covered for sale under the registration statements 
in addition  we may amend our shelf registration statements or file a new shelf registration statement to increase our potential access to capital 
if we elect to raise additional capital using a shelf registration statement  we may use the net proceeds from the sale of these securities for general corporate purposes  which may include funding clinical trials  research and development  regulatory activities  acquisitions  including acquisitions of companies  products  intellectual property or other technology  repayment or refinancing of existing indebtedness  investments  capital expenditures  repurchase of our capital stock and for any other purposes that we may specify in any prospectus supplement 
equity line of credit arrangement in august  we entered into what is sometimes termed an equity line of credit arrangement with azimuth opportunity ltd 
the arrangement provides that  upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein  azimuth is committed to purchase up to million of our common stock  or up to a maximum of approximately million shares of common stock  whichever occurs first  over the month term of the agreement 
from time to time during the term of the agreement  and at our sole discretion  we may present azimuth with draw down notices requiring azimuth to purchase our common stock at a per share purchase price equal to the daily volume weighted average price of the common stock  less a discount ranging from to  based on the volume weighted average price of the common stock 
as a result  our existing common stockholders will experience immediate dilution upon the purchase of any shares of our common stock by azimuth under this agreement 
the sale of shares under this equity line will be dilutive to existing stockholders and may have an adverse effect on the price of our securities 
the arrangement includes provisions under which we may  if elected  terminate this equity line of credit without financial penalty 
off balance sheet financing arrangements we currently do not have any special purpose entities or off balance sheet financing arrangements other than operating leases 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods contractual payments due by period in s obligations total and beyond long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total long term debt of million includes million in principal and interest payable to general electric capital corporation and million in principal and interest payable to oxford finance corporation under equipment loans with payments due in monthly installments over to months  collateralized by the corresponding equipment 
the loans are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of certain events of default  including failure to timely pay principal and interest 
also included under long term debt is million in principal and interest payments due under the massdevelopment loan  under which we borrowed million to finance improvements to our commercial manufacturing facility in tewksbury  massachusetts 
interest accrues under the loan at per annum with retroactive adjustments to in the event we achieve positive operating cash flow as defined in the agreement without prior repayment of the loan 
the repayment of principal and accrued interest coincides with the term of the tewksbury lease which has an initial five year  nine month term 
no payments were due under the loan for the first months  we are scheduled to begin loan repayments in may the loan is subject to acceleration upon certain events of default  including failure to timely pay principal and interest 
capital lease obligations as classified pursuant to fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases relate to leases for business equipment 
we leased capital equipment through banc of america leasing corporation 
the remaining monthly payments range from to  with maturities through june our operating lease obligations of million relate primarily to our headquarters and manufacturing facility leases under which we pay monthly rent 
our watertown  massachusetts headquarters lease has an original term of years  which began in december  and which was extended by six months during the lease for our commercial manufacturing space in tewksbury  massachusetts has an initial five year  nine month term  which began in july  with options to extend the lease for up to two additional five year terms at predetermined rental rates 
purchase obligations include one purchase order to a supplier for material 
other long term liabilities of million includes a million payment due in june to ge healthcare pursuant to intellectual property license agreement and a million payment due in may to schering pursuant to intellectual property acquisition agreement 
the million amount excludes contingent milestone and royalty obligations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenues  accrued expenses  fair valuation of stock related to stock based compensation and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue 
we recognize revenue from license arrangements in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab and fasb emerging issue task force issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
we recognize revenue from license payments not tied to achieving a specific performance milestone ratably over the period over which we are obligated to perform services 
the period over which we are obligated to perform services is estimated based on available facts and circumstances 
we recognize revenue from performance payments  when such performance is substantially in our control and when we believe that completion of such performance is reasonably probable  ratably over the period over which we estimate that we will perform such performance obligations 
substantive at risk milestone payments  which are based on achieving a specific performance milestone when performance of such milestone is contingent on performance by others or for which achievement can not be reasonably estimated or assured  are recognized as revenue when the milestone is achieved and the related payment is due  provided that there is no substantial future service obligation associated with the milestone 
we do not recognize revenue in connection with license arrangements until payments are collected or due and reasonably assured of being collected 
in addition  we do not recognize revenue in circumstances where the arrangement includes a refund provision until the refund condition is no longer applicable unless  in our judgment  the refund circumstances are within our operating control and unlikely to occur 
payments received in advance of being recognized as revenue are deferred 
in connection with feasibility studies  contract amounts which are not due until the customer accepts or verifies the research results are not recognized as revenue until customer acceptance  assuming collectibility is reasonable assured 
we are recognizing collaboration revenue of million associated with the initial license and performance based payments under the nycomed agreement based on an estimated recognition period of fifty four months over which we are obligated to perform services supporting the agreement and assumes that imagify will be ready for commercialization in the second half of at the time we entered into our agreement with nycomed  we estimated that the development period would be months 
this estimate was revised to months in the third quarter of the effect of this change in estimate resulted in million less revenue recorded in than would have been recorded had the development period remained at months 
estimation of this development period involves many assumptions  including estimates relating to completion of activities for which we are reliant on nycomed and independent regulatory authorities to achieve 
our estimated development recognition period may change again if facts and circumstances change 
were the estimated development period to be extended  we may be required to record a reduction in cumulative revenue recognized in our statement of operations in the period in which the change in development period is determined 
our agreement with nycomed has been modified such that nycomed has paid us million for activities associated with creating a brand name for imagify and related trademark activities and paid us million to support the validation of the our commercial manufacturing facility for imagify 
these amounts were originally scheduled to be paid to us upon nycomed s filing for regulatory approval of imagify in europe 
while the amounts are not refundable  we plan to defer recognition of these amounts until after the original regulatory filing milestone has been achieved 
payments received for current and potential hdds and pdds feasibility studies  which are offset by costs incurred for such studies  are recognized as revenue over the estimated performance period of each such study 
a change in these estimates could result in a significant change to the amount of revenue recognized in future periods 
in addition  if the nycomed collaboration agreement is terminated for reasons other than certain non performance by us  we would recognize the remainder of the payments we have received or otherwise expect to collect over the amortization period at the time of termination 
we will not recognize revenue associated with the potential additional million in milestone based payments that may be earned under the nycomed agreement until the underlying regulatory and sales milestones are achieved 
property and equipment 
property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives of three to five years using the straight line method 
the majority of our equipment is related to our ongoing research and development activities  including equipment which  subject to regulatory approvals  we intended to use for commercial manufacture of imagify 
we consider that this equipment is placed in service when operation of the equipment is started up and begin depreciating the equipment at this time 
the equipment in our commercial manufacturing facility is currently undergoing research and development related activities that result in wear and tear on the equipment including include ongoing calibration and testing 
leasehold improvements and equipment under capital leases are recorded at cost 
we depreciate leasehold improvements and equipment under capital leases over the lesser of their useful lives or the remainder of their respective lease terms 
we began depreciation of leasehold improvements at our tewksbury facility in october upon receipt of an occupancy permit and taking occupancy of the facility 
our leasehold improvements costs on this facility approximate million and are being depreciated ratably over remaining term of our present lease  the initial term of which is scheduled in expire in april we believe that the use of the initial term of the lease for the depreciation period  rather than assuming that the lease term is renewed  is appropriate given the inherent uncertainties with a product such as imagify  which has not yet completed its phase clinical trials and requires regulatory approvals before it can be marketed 
the risk factors included under section a of this document discuss the uncertainties associated with imagify 
accrued expenses 
as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services which have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements 
examples of estimated expenses for which we accrue include professional service fees  such as lawyers and accountants  and contract service fees such as amounts paid to clinical monitors  data management organizations and investigators in conjunction with clinical trials  and fees paid to consultants used in the qualification of our commercial manufacturing facility for imagify 
in connection with such service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided relative to the actual levels of services incurred by such service providers 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs which have begun to be incurred or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for such period would be too low or too high 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services are often judgmental  but have not varied materially from actual costs incurred 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
stock based compensation and other equity instruments 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of fas r  share based payment 
under fas r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the appropriate vesting period 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term of stock options  the expected volatility of our stock and expected dividends 
in addition  judgment is required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates or different key assumptions were used  it could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding stock based compensation expense 
prior to adopting the provisions of fas r  we recorded estimated compensation expense for employee stock options based upon their intrinsic value on the date of grant pursuant to accounting principles board opinion apb  accounting for stock issued to employees and provided the required pro forma disclosures of fas because we established the exercise price based on the fair market value of our stock at the date of grant  the stock options had no intrinsic value upon grant  and therefore no estimated expense was recorded for stock option expense prior to adopting fas r 
conversely  when the exercise price for accounting purposes was below fair value of our common stock at the date of grant  a non cash charge to compensation expense was recorded ratably over the term of the option vesting period in an amount equal to the difference between the value calculated using the exercise price and the fair value 
we did issue options prior to its initial s filing in july at values less than fair market 
these grants resulted in the recording of deferred compensation 
stock options are not included in the calculation of diluted net loss per common share due to the antidilutive effect of the stock options for all periods presented 
accounting for equity instruments granted or sold by us under apb no 
 apb no 
 fas and eitf no 
requires fair value estimates of the equity instrument granted or sold 
if our estimates of the fair value of these equity instruments are too high or too low  it would have the effect of overstating or understating expenses 
when equity instruments are granted or sold in exchange for the receipt of goods or services and the value of those goods or services can be readily estimated  we use the value of such goods or services to determine the fair value of the equity instruments 
when equity instruments are granted or sold in exchange for the receipt of goods or services and the value of those goods or services can not be readily estimated  as is true in connection with most stock options and warrants granted to employees or non employees  we estimated the fair value of the equity instruments based upon consideration of factors which we deemed to be relevant at the time using cost  market and or income approaches to such valuations 
the fair values of all stock option grants issued were determined using a black scholes model in which we are required to make assumptions for the risk free interest rate  the expected volatility of the underlying stock  forfeiture rates and expected life of option grants 
the risk free rates are the weighted average of the yield rates on year us treasury notes on the dates of the stock option grants 
we used the historical volatility of our market traded stock for the expected volatility assumption 
forfeiture rates are calculated based on actual historical forfeitures 
the expected life of employee stock options represents the weighted average period the stock options are estimated to remain outstanding 
the expected life of employee stock options is  in part  a function of the options remaining contractual life and the extent to which the option is in the money ie  the average stock price during the period is above the strike price of the stock option 
we estimate that  based on these variables  options are likely on average to be exercised in approximately years from the date of grant 
derivative liabilities 
the terms of our february convertible preferred stock offering and our march massdevelopment loan agreement contain features considered to be embedded derivatives which are recorded at estimated fair value in accordance with fas the estimation of this fair value includes various assumptions and estimates  including assumptions and estimates of risk free interest rates  stock price volatility and the timing of future preferred stock conversions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions can increase or decrease the value of this derivative liability 
the unrealized gain or loss of the derivative financial instrument is included in our statement of operations 
the convertible preferred stock terms include a dividend make whole payment provision  which has been initially recorded at its estimated fair value 
this derivative liability is reduced upon conversion of the preferred stock as well as dividends declared by our board of directors  if any 
the massdevelopment loan agreement includes a provision for a retroactive interest rate increase in the event that we achieve certain defined positive operating cash flows 
the initial fair value of the massdevelopment loan derivative is being amortized over a term beginning with the loan agreement effective date and ending with the estimated payment date of the retroactive interest 
the fair value of both derivative liabilities are re measured at each reporting period 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in addition  as of december   we had federal tax net operating loss carryforwards of million  which expire through we also have research and development credit carryforwards of million 
we have recorded a valuation allowance to fully offset against these otherwise recognizable net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of the realization of the tax benefit 
in the event that we determine in the future that we will be able to realize all or a portion of its net deferred tax benefit  an adjustment to deferred tax valuation allowance would increase net income in the period in which such a determination is made 
the us tax code contains provisions that may limit the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and credits available to be used in any given year in the event of significant changes in ownership interest  as defined 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement 
fin prescribes a comprehensive model for recognizing  measuring  presenting and disclosing in the financial statements tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  including a decision whether to file or not to file in a particular jurisdiction 
fin also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition and defines the criteria that must be met for the benefits of a tax position to be recognized 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  changes in net assets as a result of application of fin must be accounted for as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
we have completed our initial evaluation of the impact of the january  adoption of fin and determined that such adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results from operations 
in september  fasb issued sfas fas no 
 fair value measurements  which is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the purpose of fas is to clarify and set forth consistent rules for defining fair value  establishing a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expanding disclosures about fair value measurements 
fas applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements where those accounting pronouncements have determined that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
fas does not require any new fair value measurements  but for some entities the application of fas could change current practice 
we are currently assessing what impact  if any  the adoption of this statement will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the sec issued sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  which provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
we adopted the provisions of sab no 
 as required and such adoption did not have any impact on our financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  which is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year beginning after november  this statement allows the measurement at fair value of financial instruments and certain other items that are currently not required to be measured at fair value 
the objective of fas is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
the fair value option established by this statement permits the measurement of eligible items at fair value at specified election dates  with unrealized gains and losses on the items for which the fair value option has been elected reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
we are currently assessing what impact  if any  the adoption of this statement will have on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have not used derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
however  we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
our current policy is to maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of us money market and government grade securities  directly or through managed funds  with maturities of one year or less 
our cash is deposited in and invested through highly rated financial institutions in north america 
our cash equivalents are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at december   we estimate that the fair value of our investment portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
we currently have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a change in market interest rates on our investments 
our equipment loans and capital leases are not subject to interest rate fluctuations because the interest rates are fixed at the time of borrowing 
effects of inflation our assets are primarily monetary  consisting of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
because of their liquidity  these assets are not directly affected by inflation 
we also believe that we have intangible assets in the value of our technology 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we have not capitalized the value of this intellectual property on our consolidated balance sheet 
due to the nature of this intellectual property  we believe that these intangible assets are not affected by inflation 
because we intend to retain and continue to use our equipment  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements  we believe that the incremental inflation related to replacement costs of such items will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  such as those for employee compensation and contract services  which could increase our level of expenses and the rate at which we use our resources
