the million of floating rate senior notes were fully redeemed on december  we utilized borrowings of million under our amended revolving credit facility and million of our cash on hand to fund the redemption of the floating rate senior notes 
as a result of the redemption  a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal on november   we completed a private offering of million of the convertible notes  the proceeds of which were used to fund in part the j j acquisition 
the convertible notes bear interest at an annual rate of  payable semi annually on may and november of each year  with the first interest payment due on may  concurrently with the sale of the convertible notes  we purchased a note hedge for million and issued warrants for proceeds of million with an affiliate of merrill lynch the counterparty 
the note hedge and warrants are separate and legally distinct instruments that bind us and the counterparty and have no binding effect on the holders of the convertible notes

the proceeds from the term loan under the credit facility were used to finance in part the j j acquisition

in connection with the consent solicitation  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional million of our common stock under the terms of our existing stock repurchase program 
as of february   the current amount available under the authorization from the board of directors was million 
litigation over the past two years  we have resolved all of the claims submitted in the dexatrim ppa settlement 
a total of million was previously funded into a settlement trust by our insurers and sidmak laboratories  inc  the manufacturer of dexatrim products containing ppa  for the purpose of paying claims in the settlement 
all claims in the settlement and expenses of the trust have now been paid 
on june   we filed a motion to dissolve the settlement trust 
the court granted this motion on july  on august   the settlement trust paid us million which is included as a component of litigation settlement in our condensed consolidated statement of income 
the settlement trust currently has a balance of approximately million 
we expect to use those funds to resolve the one pending dexatrim ppa case which opted out of the settlement 
any funds remaining after we resolve the opt out case will be returned to one of our insurance carriers 
we currently do not expect to record any additional charges relative to the settlement of the ppa litigation  except for legal expenses that will be recorded in the period incurred 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we entered into a settlement agreement with the delaco company delaco  successor by merger to the thompson medical company  inc  which owned the dexatrim brand prior to december  the delaco agreement

in addition  this order allows us to dismiss all cases against us with injury dates prior to december   and channel these cases to the delaco settlement trust whether brought by an injured party or a co defendant to a dexatrim products liability case 
we expect all claims with injury dates prior to december  to be channeled to the delaco settlement trust 
the confirmation of the delaco bankruptcy plan effectively releases us from liability for all ppa products liability cases with injury dates prior to december  acquisition on january   we completed the j j acquisition for million 
the acquisition was funded with the proceeds received from the convertible notes  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and funds provided from the term loan under our credit facility

several different estimates or methods can be used by management that might yield different results 
the following are the significant estimates used by management in the preparation of the november  consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts as of november   an estimate was made of the collectibility of the outstanding accounts receivable balances 
this estimate requires the utilization of outside credit services  knowledge about the customer and the customer s industry  new developments in the customer s industry and operating results of the customer as well as general economic conditions and historical trends 
when all these facts are compiled  a judgment as to the collectibility of the individual account is made 
many factors can impact this estimate  including those noted in this paragraph 
the adequacy of the estimated allowance may be impacted by the deterioration in the financial condition of a large customer  weakness in the economic environment resulting in a higher level of customer bankruptcy filings or delinquencies and the competitive environment in which the customer operates 
during the year ended november   we performed a detailed assessment of the collectibility of trade accounts receivable and did not make any significant adjustments to our estimate of allowance for doubtful accounts 
the balance of allowance for doubtful accounts was million  million and million at november   and  respectively 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when our products are shipped and title transfers to our customers 
it is generally our policy across all classes of customers that all sales are final 
as is common in the consumer products industry  customers return products for a variety of reasons including products damaged in transit  discontinuance of a particular size or form of product and shipping errors 
as sales are recorded  we accrue an estimated amount for product returns  as a reduction of these sales  based upon our historical experience and consideration of discontinued products  product divestitures  estimated inventory levels held by our customers and retail point of sale data on existing and newly introduced products 
the level of returns may fluctuate from our estimates due to several factors including weather conditions  customer inventory levels and competitive conditions 
we charge the allowance account for product returns when the customer provides appropriate supporting documentation that the product is properly destroyed or upon receipt of the product 
we separate returns into the two categories of seasonal and non seasonal products 
we use the historical return detail of seasonal and non seasonal products for at least the most recent three fiscal years on generally all products  which is normalized for any specific occurrence that is not reasonably likely to recur  to determine the amount of product returned as a percentage of sales  and estimate an allowance for potential returns based on product sold in the current period 
to consider product sold in current and prior periods  an estimate of inventory held by our retail customers is calculated based on customer inventory detail 
this estimate of inventory held by our customers  along with historical returns as a percentage of sales  is used to determine an estimate of potential product returns 
this estimate of the allowance for seasonal and non seasonal returns is further analyzed by considering retail customer point of sale data 
we also consider specific events  such as discontinued product or product divestitures  when determining the adequacy of the allowance 
our estimate of product returns for seasonal and non seasonal products as of november  was million and million  respectively  million and million  respectively  as of november  and million and million  respectively  as of november  as of november  and november   estimated returns of phisoderm product was million and million  respectively  due to our november  divestiture of this brand 
based on consideration of the sales of icy hot pro therapy performing below expectations  review of retail point of sales data throughout fiscal and an estimate of inventory on hand at customers  we have estimated returns as of november  of million  which decreased net sales on our consolidated financial statements 
as a result of higher sales volumes in fiscal  we increased our estimate of returns for seasonal products by approximately million  which resulted in a decrease to net sales in our consolidated financial statements 
for fiscal and  we decreased our estimate of seasonal returns by approximately million and million  respectively  which resulted in an increase to net sales in our consolidated financial statements 
during the fiscal years ended november  and  as a result of our estimate of customer inventory levels  historical non seasonal product returns and retail point of sale data  we increased our estimate of non seasonal returns by approximately million and million  respectively  which resulted in a decrease to net sales in our consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  we decreased our estimate of non seasonal returns by approximately million  which resulted in an increase to net sales in our consolidated financial statements 
each percentage point change in the seasonal return rate would impact net sales by approximately million 
each percentage point change in the non seasonal return rate would impact net sales by approximately million 
we routinely enter into agreements with customers to participate in promotional programs 
the cost of these programs is recorded as either advertising and promotion expense or as a reduction of sales as prescribed by emerging issues task force  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
a significant portion of the programs are recorded as a reduction of sales and generally take the form of coupons and vendor allowances  which are normally taken via temporary price reductions  scan downs  display activity and participations in in store programs provided uniquely by the customer 
we also enter into cooperative advertising programs with certain customers  the cost of which is recorded as advertising and promotion expense 
in order for retailers to receive reimbursement under such programs  the retailer must meet specified advertising guidelines and provide appropriate documentation of the advertisement being run 
during fiscal  and  our cooperative advertising reimbursements did not exceed the fair value of the benefits received under those programs 
we analyze promotional programs in two primary categories coupons and vendor allowances 
customers normally utilize vendor allowances in the form of temporary price reductions  scan downs  display activity and participations in in store programs provided uniquely by the customer 
we estimate the accrual for outstanding coupons by utilizing a third party clearinghouse to track coupons issued  coupon value  distribution and expiration dates  quantity distributed and estimated redemption rates that are provided by us 
we estimate the redemption rates based on internal analysis of historical coupon redemption rates and expected future retail sales by considering recent point of sale data 
the estimate for vendor allowances is based on estimated unit sales of a product under a program and amounts committed for such programs in each fiscal year 
estimated unit sales are determined by considering customer forecasted sales  point of sale data and the nature of the program being offered 
the three most recent years of expected program payments versus actual payments made and current year retail point of sale trends are analyzed to determine future expected payments 
customer delays in requesting promotional program payments due to their audit of program participation and resulting request for reimbursement is also considered to evaluate the accrual for vendor allowances 
the costs of these programs is often variable based on the number of units actually sold 
as of november   the coupon accrual and reserve for vendor allowances were million and million  respectively  million and million  respectively  as of november  and million and million  respectively  as of november  each percentage point change in promotional program participation would impact net sales by million and advertising and promotion expense by an insignificant amount 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach as prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this approach requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of an asset or liability 
we record income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements based on an estimated annual effective income tax rate 
our estimated annual effective income tax rate during fiscal was  as compared to in fiscal and in fiscal  as a result of lower deductions for charitable contributions and greater apportionment in states with higher statutory tax rates

selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million from million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were and of total revenues for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease was attributable to lower compensation expense in the current year related to payments associated with restricted stock grants in the prior year and an executive severance charge in fiscal  offset in part by share based compensation expense under sfas r in fiscal litigation settlement charges litigation settlement for fiscal reflected the million recovery from the delaco settlement trust in the first quarter of  the million recovery from the settlement trust in the third quarter of in the dexatrim litigation settlement and net legal expenses related to the dexatrim litigation of million  compared to the reversal of a charge of million related to the dexatrim litigation  million reimbursement from the settlement trust for previously incurred administrative costs for the same period of fiscal  offset by legal expenses and ephedrine related claims of million related to the settlement of dexatrim litigation

cash of million and million was provided by operations in fiscal and  respectively 
increased net income and reduced accounts receivable  due mainly to the receipt of cash from the sale of phisoderm in  was offset by increased inventory  due primarily to inventory related to icy hot pro therapy  and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
investing activities used cash of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in the usage of cash was primarily due to proceeds received from the sale of our selsun business in certain countries in africa and asia in fiscal financing activities used cash of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in cash used primarily was attributable to the sale of the million convertible notes in fiscal and the sale of warrants for million  which offset the payoff of the million floating rate senior notes  the repurchase of million of common stock and the purchase of the convertible note hedge for million 
as of november   our total debt was million  consisting of our subordinated notes of million and our convertible notes of million 
as of november   we had no borrowings outstanding under our amended revolving credit facility with available borrowings of up to million

the forward starting swap has decreasing notional principal amounts beginning october  and a swap rate of over the life of the agreement 
on july   we successfully completed a consent solicitation from the holders of the subordinated notes to an amendment to the indenture governing such notes to increase our capacity to make restricted payments by an additional million  including payments for the repurchase of our common stock and adjust the fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the indenture 
in connection with the consent solicitation  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional million of our common stock under the terms of our existing stock repurchase program 
during fiscal  we repurchased  shares of our common stock for million 
we believe that cash provided by operating activities  our cash and cash equivalents balance and funds available under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures  debt service and working capital requirements for the foreseeable future as our business is currently conducted 
it is likely that any acquisitions we make in the future will require us to obtain additional financing 
contractual obligations the following data summarizes our contractual obligations as of november  we had no commercial obligations as of november  payments due by contractual obligations total within year years years after years dollars in thousands long term debt operating leases purchase commitments endorsements total purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
our purchase orders are based on our current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
other than as presented in the table above  we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months 
foreign operations historically  our primary foreign operations have been conducted through our canadian and united kingdom uk subsidiaries 
since november   our european business has been conducted through chattem global consumer products limited  a wholly owned subsidiary located in limerick  ireland 
the functional currencies of these subsidiaries are canadian dollars  british pounds and euros  respectively 
fluctuations in exchange rates can impact operating results  including total revenues and expenses  when translations of the subsidiary financial statements are made in accordance with sfas no 
 foreign currency translation 
for fiscal and  these subsidiaries accounted for of total revenues  respectively  and of total assets  respectively 
it has not been our practice to hedge our assets and liabilities in canada  the uk and ireland or our intercompany transactions due to the inherent risks associated with foreign currency hedging transactions and the timing of payments between us and our foreign subsidiaries 
following our acquisition of selsun blue  our international business operations have expanded significantly  which has increased our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
during fiscal  a portion of these foreign sales was reflected as royalties  which have been paid to us in us dollars 
in addition  until july abbott laboratories abbott  from whom we acquired selsun blue  continued to supply a portion of our international supply of selsun and billed us in us dollars in certain instances 
beginning april   a portion of our international supply of selsun was billed to us in local currencies 
historically  gains or losses from foreign currency transactions have not had a material impact on our operating results 
an insignificant loss for the year ended november  and a gain of million for the year ended november  resulted from foreign currency transactions and are included in selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income
