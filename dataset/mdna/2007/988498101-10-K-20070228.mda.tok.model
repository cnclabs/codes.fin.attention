these amounts are derived by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates 
we also provide the percentage change excluding the extra week certain of our businesses had in fiscal we believe the elimination of the currency translation impact and the rd week impact provides better year to year comparability without the distortion of foreign currency fluctuations or an extra week in fiscal this md a should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements on pages through and the cautionary statements on page all note references herein refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements on pages through tabular amounts are displayed in millions except per share and unit count amounts  or as otherwise specifically identified 
significant known events  trends or uncertainties impacting or expected to impact comparisons of reported or future results the following factors impacted comparability of operating performance for the years ended december   december  and december  and could impact comparability with our results in extra week in our fiscal calendar results in a rd week every five or six years 
fiscal year included a rd week in the fourth quarter for the majority of our us businesses as well as our international businesses that report on a period  as opposed to a monthly  basis 
in the us  we permanently accelerated the timing of the kfc business closing by one week in december  and thus  there was no rd week benefit for this business 
additionally  all china division businesses report on a monthly basis and thus did not have a rd week 
the following table summarizes the estimated increase decrease of the rd week on fiscal year revenues and operating profit us international division unallocated total revenues company sales franchise and license fees total revenues operating profit franchise and license fees restaurant profit general and administrative expenses equity income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates operating profit mainland china recovery our kfc business in mainland china was negatively impacted by the interruption of product offerings and negative publicity associated with a supplier ingredient issue experienced in late march as well as consumer concerns related to avian flu in the fourth quarter of as a result of the aforementioned issues  the china division experienced system sales growth in of excluding currency translation which is below our ongoing target of at least 
during the year ended december   the china division recovered from these issues and achieved growth rates of for both system sales and company sales  both excluding currency translation 
during  we entered into agreements with the supplier of the aforementioned ingredient 
as a result  we recognized recoveries of approximately million in other income expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  united states restaurant profit restaurant profits in the us were positively impacted by a decline of approximately million in commodity costs principally meats and cheese for the year ended versus the year ended we expect commodity inflation in the us of to in our us restaurant profits were also positively impacted by lower self insured property and casualty insurance expenses of million for the year ended versus these lower insurance expenses were the result of improved loss trends  which we believe are driven by safety and other measures we have implemented over time  on our insurance reserves and lower property related losses including the lapping of the unfavorable impact of hurricane katrina in and a small  related insurance recovery in 
while we anticipate that these favorable loss trends will continue  it is difficult to forecast their impact  including the impact of large property and casualty losses that may occur 
however  we anticipate that given the significant favorability in  property and casualty insurance expense in will be flat to slightly higher in comparison 
taco bell northeast united states produce sourcing issue our taco bell business was negatively impacted by adverse publicity related to a produce sourcing issue during november and december as a result  taco bell experienced significant sales declines at both company and franchise stores  particularly in the northeast united states where an outbreak of illness associated with a particular strain of e 
coli h took place 
according to the centers for disease control this outbreak was associated with eating at taco bell restaurants in pennsylvania  new jersey  new york and delaware 
in the fourth quarter of  taco bell s company same store sales were down  driven largely by a very significant negative sales impact during the month of december 
overall  we estimate this issue negatively impacted operating profit by million in the fourth quarter of due primarily to lost company sales and franchise and license fees as well as incremental marketing costs 
same store sales at taco bell have begun to recover from their lowest point in the third week of december 
while we anticipate that taco bell will fully recover from this issue by the middle of  our experience has been that recoveries of this type vary in duration and could take longer 
the timing of such recovery will determine the impact on operating profit 
we currently forecast same store sales growth at taco bell in of one to two percent 
us beverage agreement contract termination during the first quarter of  we entered into an agreement with a beverage supplier to certain of our concepts to terminate a long term supply contract 
as a result of the cash payment we made to the supplier in connection with this termination  we recorded a pre tax charge of million to other income expense in the quarter ended march  the affected concepts have entered into an agreement with an alternative beverage supplier 
the contract termination charge we recorded in the quarter ended march  was partly offset by more favorable beverage pricing for our concepts in we expect to continue to benefit from the more favorable pricing in and beyond 
pizza hut united kingdom acquisition on september   we completed the acquisition of the remaining fifty percent ownership interest of our pizza hut united kingdom uk unconsolidated affiliate from our partner  paying approximately million in cash  including transaction costs and net of million of cash assumed 
additionally  we assumed the full liability  as opposed to our fifty percent share  associated with the pizza hut uk s capital leases of million and short term borrowings of million 
this unconsolidated affiliate operated more than restaurants in the uk prior to the acquisition  we accounted for our fifty percent ownership interest using the equity method of accounting 
thus  we reported our fifty percent share of the net income of the unconsolidated affiliate after interest expense and income taxes as other income expense in the consolidated statements of income 
we also recorded franchise fee income from the stores owned by the unconsolidated affiliate 
from the date of the acquisition through december  the end of the fiscal year for pizza hut uk  we reported company sales and the associated restaurant costs  general and administrative expense  interest expense and income taxes associated with the restaurants previously owned by the unconsolidated affiliate in the appropriate line items of our consolidated statement of income 
we no longer recorded franchise fee income for the restaurants previously owned by the unconsolidated affiliate nor did we report other income under the equity method of accounting 
as a result of this acquisition  company sales and restaurant profit increased million and million  respectively  franchise fees decreased million and general and administrative expenses increased million compared to the year ended december  the impacts on operating profit and net income were not significant 
adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment in the fourth quarter  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires all new  modified and unvested share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and stock appreciation rights  be recognized in the financial statements as compensation cost over the service period based on their fair value on the date of grant 
compensation cost is recognized over the service period on a straight line basis for the fair value of awards that actually vest 
we adopted sfas r using the modified retrospective application transition method effective september   the beginning of our fourth quarter 
as permitted by sfas r  we applied the modified retrospective application transition method to the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption our fiscal year 
as such  the results for the first three quarters of were required to be adjusted to recognize the compensation cost previously reported in the pro forma footnote disclosures under the provisions of sfas however  years prior to have not been restated 
as shown below  the adoption of sfas r resulted in a decrease in net income of million and a reduction of basic and diluted earnings per share of for additionally  cash flows from operating activities decreased million in and cash flows from financing activities increased million in the impact of applying sfas r on the results of operations and cash flows for was similar to the impact on us international china unallocated total payroll and employee benefits general and administrative operating profit income tax benefit net income impact basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share prior to  all stock options granted were accounted for under the recognition and measurement principles of apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related interpretations 
accordingly  no stock based employee compensation expense was reflected in the consolidated statements of income for stock options  as all stock options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
had the company applied the fair value provisions of sfas to stock options in  net income of million would have been reduced by million to million 
additionally  both basic and diluted earnings per common share would have decreased per share for sale of an investment in unconsolidated affiliate during the second quarter of  we sold our fifty percent interest in the entity that operated almost all kfcs and pizza huts in poland and the czech republic to our then partner in the entity  principally for cash 
concurrent with the sale  our former partner completed an initial public offering ipo of the majority of the stock it then owned in the entity 
prior to the sale  we accounted for our investment in this entity using the equity method 
subsequent to the ipo  the new publicly held entity  in which yum has no ownership interest  is a franchisee as was the entity in which we previously held a fifty percent interest 
in  this transaction generated a gain of approximately million for yum as cash proceeds net of expenses of approximately million from the sale of our interest in the entity exceeded our recorded investment in this unconsolidated affiliate 
as with our equity income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates  the gain of approximately million was recorded in other income expense in our consolidated statement of income 
the sale did not have a significant impact on our subsequently reported results of operations in or sale of puerto rico business our puerto rico business was held for sale beginning the fourth quarter of and was sold on october  for an amount approximating its then carrying value 
as a result of this sale  company sales and restaurant profit decreased million and million  respectively  franchise fees increased million and general and administrative expenses decreased million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  lease accounting adjustments in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an adjustment to correct instances where our leasehold improvements were not being depreciated over the shorter of their useful lives or the term of the lease  including options in some instances  over which we were recording rent expense  including escalations  on a straight line basis 
the cumulative adjustment  primarily through increased us depreciation expense  totaled million million after tax

store portfolio strategy from time to time we sell company restaurants to existing and new franchisees where geographic synergies can be obtained or where franchisees expertise can generally be leveraged to improve our overall operating performance  while retaining company ownership of strategic us and international markets 
in the us  we are in the process of decreasing our company ownership of restaurants from its current level of to approximately 
this three year plan calls for selling approximately  company restaurants to franchisees from through in  company restaurants in the us were sold to franchisees 
in the international division  we expect to refranchise approximately pizza huts in the united kingdom over the next several years reducing our pizza hut company ownership in that market from approximately currently to approximately 
refranchisings reduce our reported revenues and restaurant profits and increase the importance of system sales growth as a key performance measure 
the following table summarizes our refranchising activities number of units refranchised refranchising proceeds  pre tax refranchising net gains  pre tax in addition to our refranchising program  from time to time we close restaurants that are poor performing  we relocate restaurants to a new site within the same trade area or we consolidate two or more of our existing units into a single unit collectively store closures

liquidity and capital resources operating in the qsr industry allows us to generate substantial cash flows from the operations of our company stores and from our franchise operations  which require a limited yum investment 
in each of the last five fiscal years  net cash provided by operating activities has exceeded billion 
we expect these levels of net cash provided by operating activities to continue in the foreseeable future 
our discretionary spending includes capital spending for new restaurants  acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees  repurchases of shares of our common stock and dividends paid to our shareholders 
unforeseen downturns in our business could adversely impact our cash flows from operations from the levels historically realized 
however  we believe our ability to reduce discretionary spending and our borrowing capacity would allow us to meet our cash requirements in and beyond 
discretionary spending during  we invested million in our businesses  including approximately million in the us  million for the international division and million for the china division 
we also acquired the remaining fifty percent ownership interest of our pizza hut united kingdom unconsolidated affiliate for million in cash 
for the second straight year  we returned over billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and quarterly dividends 
under the authority of our board of directors  we repurchased million shares of our common shares for million during in september  the board of directors authorized share repurchases of up to million of the company s outstanding common stock excluding applicable transaction fees to be purchased through september at december   we had remaining capacity to repurchase up to million of our outstanding common stock excluding applicable transaction fees under the september authorization 
during the year ended december   we paid cash dividends of million 
additionally  on november  and december   our board of directors approved cash dividends of and  respectively  per share of common stock to be distributed on february  and march   respectively  to shareholders of record at the close of business on january  and march   respectively 
for  we estimate that capital spending will be approximately million 
we also estimate that refranchising proceeds  prior to taxes  will total approximately million in we also expect to provide returns to our shareholders through both significant share repurchases and dividends 
we are targeting a to reduction of our diluted share count in borrowing capacity our primary bank credit agreement comprises a billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility the credit facility which matures in september the credit facility is unconditionally guaranteed by our principal domestic subsidiaries and contains financial covenants relating to maintenance of leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios 
the credit facility also contains affirmative and negative covenants including  among other things  limitations on certain additional indebtedness  guarantees of indebtedness  level of cash dividends  aggregate non us investment and certain other transactions specified in the agreement 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants at december  under the terms of the credit facility  we may borrow up to the maximum borrowing limit  less outstanding letters of credit 
at december   our unused credit facility totaled million  net of outstanding letters of credit of million 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at december  the interest rate for borrowings under the credit facility ranges from to over the london interbank offered rate libor or to over an alternate base rate  which is the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus 
the exact spread over libor or the alternate base rate  as applicable  depends on our performance under specified financial criteria 
interest on any outstanding borrowings under the credit facility is payable at least quarterly 
in november  we executed a five year revolving credit facility totaling million the international credit facility or icf on behalf of three of our wholly owned international subsidiaries 
the icf is unconditionally guaranteed by yum and by yum s principal domestic subsidiaries and contains covenants substantially identical to those of the credit facility 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants at the end of there were borrowings of million and available credit of million outstanding under the icf at the end of the interest rate for borrowings under the icf ranges from to over libor or to over a canadian alternate base rate  which is the greater of the citibank  na  canadian branch s publicly announced reference rate or the canadian dollar offered rate plus 
the exact spread over libor or the canadian alternate base rate  as applicable  depends upon yum s performance under specified financial criteria 
interest on any outstanding borrowings under the icf is payable at least quarterly 
in  we executed two short term borrowing arrangements the term loans on behalf of the international division 
there were borrowings of million outstanding at the end of under the term loans  both of which expired and were repaid in the first quarter of the majority of our remaining long term debt primarily comprises senior unsecured notes with varying maturity dates from through and interest rates ranging from to 
the senior unsecured notes represent senior  unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness 
amounts outstanding under senior unsecured notes were billion at december  this amount includes million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes that were issued in april due april  we used million of these proceeds to repay our senior unsecured notes that matured in april and the remainder for general corporate purposes 
contractual obligations in addition to any discretionary spending we may choose to make  our significant contractual obligations and payments as of december  included total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations a capital leases b operating leases b purchase obligations c other long term liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheet under gaap total contractual obligations a debt amounts include principal maturities and expected interest payments 
rates utilized to determine interest payments for variable rate debt are based on an estimate of future interest rates 
excludes a fair value adjustment of million deducted from debt related to interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of a portion of our debt 
see note b these obligations  which are shown on a nominal basis  relate to approximately  restaurants 
see note c purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
we have excluded agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
purchase obligations relate primarily to information technology  marketing  commodity agreements  purchases of property  plant and equipment as well as consulting  maintenance and other agreements 
we have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement medical benefit plans in the contractual obligations table 
our most significant plan  the yum retirement plan the us plan  is a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering certain full time us salaried employees 
our funding policy with respect to the us plan is to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements plus such additional amounts from time to time as are determined to be appropriate to improve the us plan s funded status 
the us plan s funded status is affected by many factors including discount rates and the performance of us plan assets 
based on current funding rules  we are not required to make minimum pension funding payments in  but we may make discretionary contributions during the year based on our estimate of the us plan s expected september  funded status 
during  we made a million discretionary contribution to the us plan  none of which represented minimum funding requirements 
at our september  measurement date  our pension plans in the us  which include the us plan and an unfunded supplemental executive plan  had a projected benefit obligation of million and plan assets of million 
the funding rules for our pension plans outside of the us vary from country to country and depend on many factors including discount rates  performance of plan assets  local laws and tax regulations 
our most significant plans are in the uk  including a plan for which we assumed full liability upon our purchase of the remaining fifty percent interest in our former pizza hut uk unconsolidated affiliate 
during  we made a discretionary contribution of approximately million to our kfc uk pension plan in anticipation of certain future funding requirements 
since our plan assets approximate our projected benefit obligation at year end for this plan  we do not anticipate any significant further  near term funding 
the projected benefit obligation of our pizza hut uk pension plan exceeds plan assets by approximately million 
we anticipate taking steps to reduce this deficit in the near term  which could include a decision to partially or completely fund the deficit in however  given the level of cash flows from operations the company anticipates generating in  any funding decision would not materially impact our ability to maintain our planned levels of discretionary spending 
during  congress passed the pension protection act of the act with the stated purpose of improving the funding of america s private pension plans 
the act introduces new funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans  introduces benefit limitations for certain under funded plans and raises tax deduction limits for contributions 
the act applies to pension plan years beginning after december  and is applicable only to our us plan 
we have preliminarily reviewed the provisions of the act to determine the impact on the company 
required funding under the act will be dependent upon many factors including our us plan s future funded status as well as discretionary contributions we may choose to make 
based upon this preliminary review as well as the current funded status of the us plan relative to our level of annual operating cash flows  we do not believe that required contributions under the act would materially impact our operating cash flows in any one given year 
our postretirement plan is not required to be funded in advance  but is pay as you go 
we made postretirement benefit payments of million in see note for further details about our pension and post retirement plans 
we have excluded from the contractual obligations table payments we may make for workers compensation  employment practices liability  general liability  automobile liability and property losses collectively property and casualty losses for which we are self insured  employee healthcare and long term disability claims for which we are self insured  and income taxes and associated interest we may pay upon audit by tax authorities of tax returns previously filed 
the majority of our recorded liability for self insured employee health  long term disability and property and casualty losses represents estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled 
we provide reserves for potential tax and associated interest exposures when we consider it probable that a taxing authority may take a substainable position on a matter contrary to our position 
off balance sheet arrangements we had provided approximately million of partial guarantees of two franchisee loan pools related primarily to the company s historical refranchising programs and  to a lesser extent  franchisee development of new restaurants at december  in support of these guarantees  we posted letters of credit of million 
we also provided a standby letter of credit of million  under which we could potentially be required to fund a portion of one of the franchisee loan pools 
the total loans outstanding under these loan pools were approximately million at december  any funding under the guarantees or letters of credit would be secured by the franchisee loans and any related collateral 
we believe that we have appropriately provided for our estimated probable exposures under these contingent liabilities 
these provisions were primarily charged to net refranchising loss gain 
new loans added to the loan pools in were not significant 
our unconsolidated affiliates have approximately million of short term debt outstanding as of december   none of which is guaranteed by yum 
accounting pronouncements adopted in the fourth quarter of in the fourth quarter of  we adopted staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement for the purpose of a materiality assessment 
sab requires that registrants quantify a current year misstatement using an approach that considers both the impact of prior year misstatements that remain on the balance sheet and those that were recorded in the current year income statement 
historically  we quantified prior year misstatements and assessed materiality based on a current year income statement approach 
the transition provisions of sab permitted the company to adjust for the cumulative effect of uncorrected prior year misstatements that were not material to any prior periods under our historical income statement approach but that were material under the guidance in sab through retained earnings at the beginning of see note for further discussion on the impact of adopting sab in the fourth quarter of  we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r sfas 
sfas required the company to recognize the funded status of its pension and post retirement plans in the december  consolidated balance sheet  with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise in future years will be recognized as a component of other comprehensive income to the extent they have not been recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost 
the impact of adopting sfas has been included in the company s december  consolidated balance sheet 
see notes and for further discussion of the impact of adopting sfas sfas also requires measurement of the funded status of pension and postretirement plans as of the date of a company s fiscal year end effective in the year ended certain of our plans currently have measurement dates that do not coincide with our fiscal year end and thus we will be required to change their measurement dates in new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  fin an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   the year beginning december  for the company 
fin requires that a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not ie a likelihood of more than fifty percent that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
a recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
upon adoption  the cumulative effect of applying the recognition and measurement provisions of fin  if any  shall be reflected as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
we do not currently anticipate that the adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings we will record upon adoption of fin will materially impact our financial condition 
fin also requires that subsequent to initial adoption a change in judgment that results in subsequent recognition  derecognition or change in a measurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period including any related interest and penalties be recognized as a discrete item in the period in which the change occurs 
currently  we record such changes in judgment  including audit settlements  as a component of our annual effective rate 
thus  our reported quarterly income tax rate may become more volatile upon adoption of fin this change will not impact the manner in which we record income tax expense on an annual basis

critical accounting policies and estimates our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments 
these judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition 
changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows in future years 
a description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies follows 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment at the individual restaurant level except when there is an expectation that we will refranchise restaurants as a group 
restaurants held and used are evaluated for impairment on a semi annual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable including a decision to close a restaurant or an offer to refranchise a restaurant or group of restaurants for less than the carrying value 
our semi annual impairment test includes those restaurants that have experienced two consecutive years of operating losses 
our semi annual impairment evaluations require an estimation of cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the restaurant  which can be for a period of over years  and any terminal value 
we limit assumptions about important factors such as sales growth and margin improvement to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants 
if the long lived assets of a restaurant subject to our semi annual test are not recoverable based upon forecasted  undiscounted cash flows  we write the assets down to their fair value 
this fair value is determined by discounting the forecasted cash flows  including terminal value  of the restaurant at an appropriate rate 
the discount rate used is our weighted average cost of capital plus a risk premium where deemed appropriate 
we often refranchise restaurants in groups and  therefore  perform such impairment evaluations at the group level 
forecasted cash flows in such instances consist of estimated holding period cash flows and the expected sales proceeds less applicable transaction costs 
expected sales proceeds are based on the most relevant of historical sales multiples or bids from buyers  and have historically been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received 
see note for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates we record impairment charges related to an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate whenever events or circumstances indicate that a decrease in the fair value of an investment has occurred which is other than temporary 
in addition  we evaluate our investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment when they have experienced two consecutive years of operating losses 
the fair values of our investments in each of our unconsolidated affiliates are currently significantly in excess of their carrying values 
see note for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we evaluate goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment through the comparison of fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values 
our reporting units are our operating segments in the us and our business management units internationally typically individual countries 
fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit  and is generally estimated by discounting expected future cash flows from the reporting unit over twenty years plus an expected terminal value 
the discount rate used in determining fair value is our weighted average cost of capital plus a risk premium where deemed appropriate 
we have recorded intangible assets as a result of business acquisitions 
these include trademark brand intangible assets for kfc  ljs and a w 
we believe the value of a trademark brand is derived from the royalty we avoid  in the case of company stores  or receive  in the case of franchise stores  due to our ownership of the trademark brand 
we have determined that the kfc trademark brand has an indefinite life and therefore it is not being amortized 
our impairment test for the kfc trademark brand consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount 
future sales are the most important assumption in determining the fair value of the kfc trademark brand 
in determining the fair value of our reporting units and the kfc trademark brand  we limit assumptions about important factors such as sales growth  margin and other factors impacting the fair value calculation to those that are supportable based upon our plans 
for  there was no impairment of goodwill or the kfc trademark brand 
we have certain intangible assets  such as the ljs and a w trademark brand intangible assets  franchise contract rights  reacquired franchise rights and favorable operating leases  which are amortized over their expected useful lives 
we base the expected useful lives of our trademark brand intangible assets on a number of factors including the competitive environment  our future development plans for the applicable concept and the level of franchisee commitment to the concept 
we generally base the expected useful lives of our franchise contract rights on their respective contractual terms including renewals when appropriate 
we base the expected useful lives of reacquired franchise rights over a period for which we believe it is reasonable that we will operate a company restaurant in the trade area 
we base the expected useful lives of our favorable operating leases on the remaining lease term 
our amortizable intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable 
an intangible asset that is deemed impaired is written down to its estimated fair value  which is based on discounted cash flows 
for purposes of our impairment analysis  we update the cash flows that were initially used to value the amortizable intangible asset to reflect our current estimates and assumptions over the asset s future remaining life 
see note for a further discussion of our policies regarding goodwill and intangible assets 
allowances for franchise and license receivables lease guarantees we reserve a franchisee s or licensee s entire receivable balance based upon pre defined aging criteria and upon the occurrence of other events that indicate that we may not collect the balance due 
as a result of reserving using this methodology  we have an immaterial amount of receivables that are past due that have not been reserved for at december  we have also issued certain guarantees as a result of assigning our interest in obligations under operating leases  primarily as a condition to the refranchising of certain company restaurants 
such guarantees are subject to the requirements of sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections sfas 
we recognize a liability for the fair value of such lease guarantees under sfas upon refranchising and upon any subsequent renewals of such leases when we remain contingently liable 
the fair value of a guarantee is the estimated amount at which the liability could be settled in a current transaction between willing parties 
if payment on the guarantee becomes probable and estimable  we record a liability for our exposure under these lease assignments and guarantees 
at december   we have recorded an immaterial liability for our exposure which we consider to be probable and estimable 
the potential total exposure under such leases is significant  with million representing the present value  discounted at our pre tax cost of debt  of the minimum payments of the assigned leases at december  current franchisees are the primary lessees under the vast majority of these leases 
we generally have cross default provisions with these franchisees that would put them in default of their franchise agreement in the event of non payment under the lease 
we believe these cross default provisions significantly reduce the risk that we will be required to make payments under these leases and  historically  we have not been required to make such payments in significant amounts 
see note for a further discussion of our policies regarding franchise and license operations 
see note for a further discussion of our lease guarantees 
self insured property and casualty losses we record our best estimate of the remaining cost to settle incurred self insured property and casualty losses 
the estimate is based on the results of an independent actuarial study and considers historical claim frequency and severity as well as changes in factors such as our business environment  benefit levels  medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact overall self insurance costs 
additionally  a risk margin to cover unforeseen events that may occur over the several years it takes for claims to settle is included in our reserve  increasing our confidence level that the recorded reserve is adequate 
see note for a further discussion of our insurance programs 
pension plans certain of our employees are covered under defined benefit pension plans 
the most significant of these plans are in the us in accordance with our fourth quarter adoption of the recognition provisions of sfas  we have recorded the under funded status of million for these us plans as a pension liability in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  these us plans had projected benefit obligations pbo of million and fair values of plan assets of million 
the pbo reflects the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees and incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels 
due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid  our pbo s are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates 
for our us plans  we measured our pbo using a discount rate of at september  this discount rate was determined with the assistance of our independent actuary 
the primary basis for our discount rate determination is a model that consists of a hypothetical portfolio of ten or more high quality corporate debt instruments with cash flows that mirror our expected benefit payment cash flows under the plans 
in considering possible bond portfolios  the model allows the bond cash flows for a particular year to exceed the expected benefit cash flows for that year 
such excesses are assumed to be reinvested at appropriate one year forward rates and used to meet the benefit cash flows in a future year 
the weighted average yield of this hypothetical portfolio was used to arrive at an appropriate discount rate 
we also insure that changes in the discount rate as compared to the prior year are consistent with the overall change in prevailing market rates 
a basis point increase in this discount rate would have decreased our us plans pbo by approximately million at our measurement dates 
conversely  a basis point decrease in this discount rate would have increased our us plans pbo by approximately million at our measurement dates 
the pension expense we will record in is also impacted by the discount rate we selected at our measurement dates 
we expect pension expense for our us plans to decrease approximately million to million in the decrease is primarily driven by a decrease in recognized actuarial loss of million in a basis point change in our weighted average discount rate assumption at our measurement date would impact our us pension expense by approximately million 
the assumption we make regarding our expected long term rates of return on plan assets also impacts our pension expense 
our estimated long term rate of return on us plan assets represents the weighted average of historical returns for each asset category  adjusted for an assessment of current market conditions 
our expected long term rate of return on us plan assets at september  was 
we believe this rate is appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market returns thereon 
a one percentage point increase or decrease in our expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption would decrease or increase  respectively  our us pension plan expense by approximately million 
the losses our us plan assets have experienced  along with a decrease in discount rates over time  have largely contributed to an unrecognized actuarial loss of million in the us plans 
for purposes of determining expense  our funded status was such that we recognized million of previously unrecognized actuarial loss 
we will recognize approximately million of unrecognized actuarial loss in given no change to our current assumptions  actuarial loss recognition will remain at an amount near that to be recognized in over the next few years before it begins to gradually decline 
see note for further discussion of our pension and post retirement plans 
stock options and stock appreciation rights expense compensation expense for stock options and stock appreciation rights sars is estimated on the grant date using a black scholes option pricing model 
our specific weighted average assumptions for the risk free interest rate  expected term  expected volatility and expected dividend yield are documented in note additionally  under sfas r we are required to estimate pre vesting forfeitures for purposes of determining compensation expense to be recognized 
future expense amounts for any particular quarterly or annual period could be affected by changes in our assumptions or changes in market conditions 
in connection with our adoption of sfas r  we determined that it was appropriate to group our awards into two homogeneous groups when estimating expected term and pre vesting forfeitures 
these groups consist of grants made primarily to restaurant level employees under our restaurant general manager stock option plan the rgm plan and grants made to executives under our other stock option plans 
historically  approximately of total options granted have been made under the rgm plan 
grants under the rgm plan typically cliff vest after four years and grants made to executives under our other stock option plans typically have a graded vesting schedule and vest per year over four years 
we use a single weighted average expected term for our awards that have a graded vesting schedule as permitted by sfas r 
we revaluate our expected term assumptions using historical exercise and post vesting employment termination behavior on a regular basis 
based on the results of this analysis  we have determined that six years is an appropriate expected term for awards to both restaurant level employees and to executives 
prior to the adoption of sfas r in we have traditionally based expected volatility on company specific historical stock data over the expected term of the option 
subsequent to adoption  we revaluated expected volatility  including consideration of both historical volatility of our stock as well as implied volatility associated with our traded options 
based on this analysis  our weighted average volatility used in the determination of fair value for grants was prior to our adoption of sfas r in we recorded reductions in expense due to pre vesting forfeitures as they occurred 
in connection with the adoption of sfas r we have estimated forfeitures based on historical data 
based on such data  we believe that approximately of all awards granted under the rgm plan will be forfeited and approximately of all awards granted to above store executives will be forfeited 
income tax valuation allowances and tax reserves at december   we have a valuation allowance of million primarily to reduce our net operating loss and tax credit carryforward benefit of million  as well our other deferred tax assets  to amounts that will more likely than not be realized 
the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards exist in federal  state and foreign jurisdictions and have varying carryforward periods and restrictions on usage 
the estimation of future taxable income in these jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards can significantly change based on future events  including our determinations as to the feasibility of certain tax planning strategies 
thus  recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes 
as a matter of course  we are regularly audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
we provide reserves for potential exposures when we consider it probable that a taxing authority may take a sustainable position on a matter contrary to our position 
we evaluate these reserves  including interest thereon  on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events  including audit settlements  that may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures 
see note for a further discussion of our income taxes and note for further discussion of certain proposed internal revenue service adjustments 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
in the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies  we manage these risks through a variety of strategies  which may include the use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to hedge our underlying exposures 
our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes  and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use 
interest rate risk we have a market risk exposure to changes in interest rates  principally in the united states 
we attempt to minimize this risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments  primarily interest rate swaps 
these swaps are entered into with financial institutions and have reset dates and critical terms that match those of the underlying debt 
accordingly  any change in market value associated with interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt 
at december  and december   a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates would result  over the following twelve month period  in a reduction of approximately million and million  respectively  in income before income taxes 
the estimated reductions are based upon the level of variable rate debt and assume no changes in the volume or composition of debt 
in addition  the fair value of our derivative financial instruments at december  and december  would decrease approximately million and million  respectively 
the fair value of our senior unsecured notes at december  and december  would decrease approximately million and million  respectively 
fair value was determined by discounting the projected cash flows 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the combined international division and china division operating profits constitute approximately of our operating profit in  excluding unallocated income expenses 
in addition  the company s net asset exposure defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities totaled approximately billion as of december  operating in international markets exposes the company to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s primary exposures result from our operations in asia pacific  europe and the americas 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates would impact the translation of our investments in foreign operations  the fair value of our foreign currency denominated financial instruments and our reported foreign currency denominated earnings and cash flows 
for the fiscal year ended december   operating profit would have decreased million if all foreign currencies had uniformly weakened relative to the us dollar 
the estimated reduction assumes no changes in sales volumes or local currency sales or input prices 
we attempt to minimize the exposure related to our investments in foreign operations by financing those investments with local currency debt when practical 
in addition  we attempt to minimize the exposure related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments by purchasing goods and services from third parties in local currencies when practical 
consequently  foreign currency denominated financial instruments consist primarily of intercompany short term receivables and payables 
at times  we utilize forward contracts to reduce our exposure related to these intercompany short term receivables and payables 
the notional amount and maturity dates of these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables such that our foreign currency exchange risk related to these instruments is eliminated 
commodity price risk we are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices 
our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is  at times  limited by the competitive environment in which we operate 
we manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements as well as  on a limited basis  commodity future and option contracts 
commodity future and option contracts entered into for the fiscal years ended december   and december   did not significantly impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
cautionary statements from time to time  in both written reports and oral statements  we present forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the statements include those identified by such words as may  will  expect  project  anticipate  believe  plan and other similar terminology 
these forward looking statements reflect our current expectations regarding future events and operating and financial performance and are based upon data available at the time of the statements 
actual results involve risks and uncertainties  including both those specific to the company and those specific to the industry  and could differ materially from expectations 
accordingly  you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements 
company risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  changes in effective tax rates  potential unfavorable variances between estimated and actual liabilities  our ability to secure distribution of products and equipment to our restaurants on favorable economic terms and our ability to ensure adequate supply of restaurant products and equipment in our stores  unexpected disruptions in our supply chain  effects and outcomes of any pending or future legal claims involving the company  the effectiveness of operating initiatives and marketing and advertising and promotional efforts  our ability to continue to recruit and motivate qualified restaurant personnel  the ongoing financial viability of our franchisees and licensees  the success of our refranchising strategy  the success of our strategies for international development and operations  volatility of actuarially determined losses and loss estimates  and adoption of new or changes in accounting policies and practices including pronouncements promulgated by standard setting bodies 
industry risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  economic and political conditions in the countries and territories where we operate  including effects of war and terrorist activities  new legislation and governmental regulations or changes in laws and regulations and the consequent impact on our business  new product and concept development by us and or our food industry competitors  changes in commodity  labor  and other operating costs  changes in competition in the food industry  publicity which may impact our business and or industry  severe weather conditions  volatility of commodity costs  increases in minimum wage and other operating costs  availability and cost of land and construction  consumer preferences or perceptions concerning the products of the company and or our competitors  spending patterns and demographic trends  political or economic instability in local markets and changes in currency exchange and interest rates  and the impact that any widespread illness or general health concern may have on our business and or the economy of the countries in which we operate
