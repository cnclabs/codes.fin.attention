item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements 
you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto 
we have based our forward looking statements about our markets and demand for our products and future results on assumptions that we consider reasonable 
actual results may differ materially from those suggested by our forward looking statements for various reasons including those discussed in cautionary statements concerning forward looking statements 
business overview spartech is an intermediary processor of engineered thermoplastics which converts base polymers or resins purchased from commodity suppliers into extruded plastic sheet and rollstock  thermoformed packaging  specialty film laminates  acrylic products  specialty plastic alloys  color concentrates and blended resin compounds  and injection molded and profile extruded products for customers in a wide range of markets 
on september   we completed the acquisition of creative forming  inc  creative  a custom manufacturer of plastic packaging with approximately million in annual sales  based in ripon  wisconsin 
the acquired operations included one facility that primarily extrudes plastic rollstock and thermoforms plastic packaging products for the food and consumer products markets 
in the fourth quarter of  we realigned our organizational structure to increase our strategic focus on plastic packaging related products 
as a result of this realignment  we established a new reportable segment  packaging technologies  which includes the newly acquired operations and packaging focused operations that had formerly been managed as part of the custom sheet and rollstock segment 
the remaining custom sheet and rollstock operations focus on manufacturing plastic sheet and rollstock that caters to durable goods manufacturers 
we now report three reportable segments and one group and all periods have been restated as if this change occurred at the beginning of the periods presented 
we operate manufacturing facilities throughout north america and one in europe that are organized into three segments and one group as follows of sales custom sheet and rollstock packaging technologies color and specialty compounds engineered products we assess net sales changes using three major drivers underlying volume  the impact of business acquisitions or divestitures and price mix 
underlying volume is calculated as the change in pounds sold exclusive of the impact on pounds sold from business acquisitions or divestitures and for a comparable number of days in the reporting period 
our fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to october and our fiscal year generally contains weeks or calendar days 
because of this convention  every fifth or sixth fiscal year has an additional week and fiscal was reported as a week fiscal year containing days of activity 
the additional week was reported in the first quarter of fiscal executive summary net earnings were million during fiscal compared to million last year 
the decrease in net earnings was largely caused by a decline in sales volume and per pound sold decrease in gross margin per pound sold 
the decline in sales volume was attributable to weak demand for durable goods which resulted in lower consolidated volumes sold to the transportation and recreation and leisure markets and lower sales of sheet to the building and construction market 
we experienced weak demand in the domestic automotive  heavy truck  residential construction  recreational vehicles and pool and spa sectors of our end markets 
the decrease in gross margin per pound sold was caused by increases in resin prices during the second half of the year while we were also experiencing weak demand which made it difficult to fully pass on the resin price increases as higher selling prices to our customers 
we generated million in cash flows from operations during compared to million last year 
of the million decrease in cash flow from operations  million was from a larger improvement in net working capital in and the remainder reflected lower current year earnings 

table of contents results of operations comparison of and consolidated summary net sales were  million and  million for the year ended and  respectively  representing a decrease in the causes of this percentage decrease were as follows underlying volume volume from additional week acquisition of business price mix the decrease in underlying volume was caused by i lower sales of compounds to the automotive sector of the transportation market  ii color concentrates to the packaging market and iii lower sales of sheet to the recreation and leisure market  the residential sector of the building and construction market and the heavy truck and automotive sectors of the transportation market 
these declines were partially offset by increases in sales of thermoformed product to the packaging market  sheet to the refrigeration sector of the appliance and electronics market and compounds to the commercial building and construction market 
disruptions from the greenville sheet consolidation also contributed to the decline in sales volume during sales volume from the additional week reflects weeks of sales activity in compared to weeks last year 
the price mix impact was flat reflecting a benefit from an increase in sales mix of thermoformed product offset by the impact from lower average resin costs in versus which were passed through to customers as lower selling prices 
the following table presents sales  components of cost of sales  and the resulting gross margin in dollars and on a per pound sold basis for and cost of sales presented in the consolidated statements of operations includes material and conversion costs and excludes amortization of intangible assets 
the material and conversion costs components of cost of sales are presented in the following table and we have not presented these components as a percentage of net sales because a comparison of this measure is distorted by changes in resin costs that are typically passed through to customers as changes to selling prices 
these changes can materially affect the percentages but do not present complete performance measures of the business 
dollars and pounds in millions net sales material costs material margin conversion costs gross margin pounds sold dollars per pound sold net sales material costs material margin conversion costs gross margin material margin and gross margin per pound sold decreased primarily because of higher resin costs in the second half of which we were not able to fully pass on to customers as higher selling prices due to a soft demand environment 
conversion costs per pound sold during increased slightly from due to an increase in per pound labor related expenses and higher depreciation expense partially offset by a shift in mix of sales to lower cost plants and reductions in freight  repairs and maintenance and packaging expenses per pound sold 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in representing an million increase over the prior year 
the expenses include a million charge associated with the resignation of the company s former president and chief executive officer in the third quarter of  a million foreign currency net loss due to a weaker us dollar during and million of selling  general and administrative expenses reported in our creative business 

table of contents excluding these factors  selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in due primarily to a million increase in information technology related costs  including depreciation expense  associated with our company wide oracle information system implementation  higher professional fees and the impact from the inclusion of an additional week during  all of which were partially offset by lower incentive compensation expenses 
the million net foreign currency loss recognized in was reported as a million loss in our corporate group and a million loss in our color and specialty compounds segment which were partially offset by a million gain in our engineered products group and a million gain in our custom sheet and rollstock segment 
in our fourth quarter of  we restructured our us dollar investment previously held by our canadian operations which will mitigate the majority of our consolidated foreign currency exposure that caused the net currency losses in in the first quarter of  we adopted sfas revised  share based payment sfas r 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we had adopted the disclosure only provisions of sfas and no expense related to stock options was recognized in our results of operations 
we implemented sfas r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the expensing of stock options upon adoption without restating prior periods 
stock based compensation was million in  of which million was recognized in selling  general and administrative and million was recorded as cost of sales 
in  stock based compensation expense was million  of which million was recognized in selling  general and administrative and million was recorded as cost of sales 
amortization of intangibles was million in compared to million in the expense includes a million charge related to the impairment of a customer related intangible asset acquired with the creative business 
in october of  pfizer  inc pfizer  a customer of creative  announced the exit of its new inhaled insulin product  exubera  which resulted in the impairment of a customer related intangible asset assigned to the pfizer relationship upon acquisition 
we expect amortization of intangibles to approximate million in in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million non cash goodwill impairment charge due to changes in our profiles business and the reorganization of the operations  management and reporting of this business which led to a redefinition of our operating segments comprising our engineered products group and allocation of goodwill to our new profiles reporting unit 
the fair value of our profiles business did not support the million goodwill allocation which resulted in the impairment charge 
restructuring and exit costs were million during and million in and largely represent employee severance  equipment moving and accelerated depreciation charges 
the restructuring and exit costs primarily reflect the expenses associated with the consolidation of three existing custom sheet and rollstock production facilities into one newly constructed facility in greenville  ohio 
the restructuring and exit costs primarily represent the expenses associated with the consolidation of three color and specialty compounds production facilities into one plant in donora  pennsylvania 
operating earnings for were million compared to million in representing a million decrease 
the decrease in operating earnings is largely attributable to the million decrease in gross margin and the million increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses  partially offset by the reduction in goodwill impairment charges 
interest expense  net was million in compared to million in the decrease in interest expense was due to the benefit realized from our focused efforts on debt reduction over the past two years and the extinguishment of our convertible subordinated debentures in  partially offset by the increase in debt to fund the creative acquisition and stock repurchases during the fourth quarter of interest expense also benefited from lower average interest rates during in  we completed a million private placement of debt and amended our us unsecured bank credit facility which increased our borrowing availability from million to million 
we used the proceeds from the private placement and borrowings from our amended credit facility to redeem our million convertible subordinated debentures which resulted in a million charge for early debt extinguishment costs 
the million early debt extinguishment costs represent million of early payment premium and million of non cash write off of unamortized debt issuance costs 
this redemption eliminated the potential dilutive effect of a future conversion of the convertible subordinated debentures and reduced our cost of borrowing 
our effective tax rate was in compared to in the improvement in the effective rate during is attributable to the impact of the non deductible goodwill impairment charge in excluding the non deductible portion of goodwill impairment charge  our effective tax rate was in we expect the effective tax rate to approximate in which reflects an enacted increase in the manufacturing deduction 
we reported net earnings of million in compared to million in these amounts reflect the impact of the items previously discussed 

table of contents custom sheet and rollstock segment net sales were million and million for and  respectively  representing a decrease in this decrease was caused by underlying volume volume from additional week price mix the decrease in underlying volume is primarily due to weak demand in the durable goods markets which adversely impacted our volume sold to the heavy truck  residential construction  automotive  recreational vehicles and pool and spa sectors of our end markets 
these declines were partially offset by increases in sales of material handling sheet to the industrial packaging industry and sales of sheet from our mexico facility to the refrigeration sector of the appliance and electronics market 
two thirds of the underlying volume decline occurred at our three facilities being consolidated into our newly constructed greenville facility 
these facilities mostly produce polyethylene based product for many of the aforementioned weak markets 
sales volume from the additional week reflects weeks of sales activity in compared to weeks last year 
the price mix impact reflects lower average resin costs in versus which were passed through to customers as lower selling prices and the impact from a lower mix of higher priced sheet  particularly in the heavy truck  recreation and leisure and pool and spa sectors of our end markets 
this segment s operating earnings in were million which compared to million in the decrease in operating earnings in was impacted by a million increase in restructuring and exit costs associated with the greenville consolidation 
excluding the impact of restructuring and exit costs  operating earnings decreased million in over the prior year of which million occurred at the three plants impacted by the greenville consolidation 
the reduction in operating earnings in was caused by the decline in sales volume along with a reduction in gross margin per pound sold which reflects a decrease in material margin per pound sold and a increase in conversion costs per pound sold 
material margin per pound decreased because of higher resin costs in the second half of the year which we were not able to fully pass on to our customers as higher selling prices due to a soft demand environment 
the disruption associated with our greenville sheet consolidation combined with the significant increase in polyethylene prices in the second half of also contributed to the decline in material margin 
despite a benefit received from a shift in sales mix to lower cost plants  conversion cost per pound sold increased due to a decrease in volume that exceeded our reductions in conversion costs 
we expect our greenville sheet consolidation to result in a million reduction in annual pre tax expenses upon completion in early fiscal packaging technologies segment net sales were million and million in and  respectively  representing an increase 
this increase was caused by underlying volume volume from additional week acquisition of business price mix the increase in underlying volume was driven by sales of thermoformed product to the food packaging market 
sales volume from the additional week reflects weeks of sales activity in compared to weeks last year 
the creative acquisition provided additional sales revenue of million for post acquisition sales in our fourth quarter of the price mix impact reflects a larger mix of higher priced thermoformed product 
this segment s operating earnings in were million compared to million in operating earnings in includes a million impairment charge related to the impairment of the pfizer customer related intangible asset acquired with the creative business 
excluding this impairment and a benefit from creative s operating results 
operating earnings increased million in over the prior year due to the increase in underlying sales volume 

table of contents color and specialty compounds segment net sales were million and million in and  respectively  representing a decrease 
this decrease was caused by underlying volume volume from additional week price mix the decrease in underlying volume was caused by lower sales of compounds to the domestic automotive sector of the transportation market and color concentrates to the packaging market partially offset by an increase in sales of commercial roofing applications 
sales volume from the additional week reflects weeks of sales activity in compared to weeks last year 
the decrease in price mix was largely caused by lower average resin costs in compared to the prior year which we passed through to customers as lower selling prices and a reduction in the sales mix of color concentrates which have a higher than average selling price per pound sold 
operating earnings for this segment were million in and million in the decrease in operating earnings was primarily caused by the decrease in underlying volumes coupled with a drop in gross margin per pound sold 
the drop in gross margin per pound was caused by rising resin costs in the second half of the year coupled with soft demand which prevented us from fully passing on the cost increases as higher selling prices  a lower mix of higher margin color concentrates as well as million of inventory adjustments in the fourth quarter of a portion of the million resulted from the correction of an error identified by our system implementation process and another portion from a decision to liquidate certain scrap inventory 
current year operating earnings compared to the prior year also reflects a million increase in foreign currency losses due to a weaker dollar in and a million decrease in restructuring and exit costs from the prior year donora consolidation 
engineered products group net sales were million and million for and  respectively  representing a sales decrease in this decrease was caused by underlying volume volume from additional week price mix sales volume from the additional week reflects weeks of sales activity in compared to weeks last year 
the price mix impact reflects lower average resin costs in compared to which we passed through to customers as lower selling prices and a higher sales mix of wheels which have a lower per pound sales price than the segment average 
this group s operating earnings in were million compared to million in the increase in operating earnings reflects a million write off of goodwill related to our profile s business in the prior year 
in addition  operating earnings benefited from a million increase in foreign currency gains resulting from a weakening us dollar during excluding the impact from these two items  operating earnings increased million which was driven by the profitability improvement in our wheels business 
corporate corporate includes corporate expenses and portions of information technology and professional fees that are not allocated to the segments and group 
corporate expenses are reported as selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
corporate expenses were million in compared to million in the prior year 
in  corporate expenses were impacted by the million charge from the resignation of our former president and chief executive officer and a million increase in foreign currency losses due to a weakening us dollar 
excluding the impact from these items  corporate expenses increased million in from higher depreciation expense and information technology related costs associated with our company wide oracle information system implementation  higher professional fees and the impact from an additional week of expenses  all of which were partially offset by lower incentive compensation expenses 
outlook while we expect to realize earnings benefits next year from our greenville consolidation  more aggressive cost reduction efforts  and recovery from current year consolidation disruptions  we expect a weak demand environment to continue through the first half of next fiscal year 
we expect this demand weakness in the durable goods markets including the domestic 
table of contents automotive  heavy truck  residential construction  recreational vehicles and pool and spa sectors of our end markets 
in addition  we expect a difficult resin cost environment to continue into next year because of continuing high oil prices  a weak us dollar and vendor consolidations in the plastics resin industry 
we are responding to these challenges by focusing on additional cost structure reductions  driving business process improvements  passing along price increases to customers and targeting of new business opportunities

dollars and pounds in millions net sales material costs material margin conversion costs gross margin pounds sold dollars per pound sold net sales material costs material margin conversion costs gross margin the increases in net sales and material costs per pound sold in reflect sales mix changes and the management of selling prices in response to increases in costs 
the prices of our major resins increased approximately on a weighted average basis in over the prior year 
material margin per pound sold increased cents in over the prior year reflecting sales mix changes and our focused efforts on managing margins for changes in resin prices and certain conversion costs 
conversion costs decreased million compared to reflecting lower labor related and other costs due to our restructuring efforts partially offset by higher utilities and freight costs from higher energy costs 
we completed the consolidation of three color and specialty compounds production facilities into one plant in the fourth quarter of and began construction of a new custom sheet and rollstock production facility in greenville  ohio in the second quarter of into which three existing production facilities will be consolidated 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses were million in representing a million increase over the prior year 
in the third quarter of  we entered into a retirement agreement with the former chief executive officer of the company which resulted in a million charge  of which million represented a non cash charge 
excluding this charge  selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in expensing stock options from the adoption of sfas r beginning in resulted in million of additional selling  general and administrative expense in the remaining million increase was primarily due to increases in labor related costs  higher it related costs from our company wide oracle information system implementation and a million charge related to the lower passaic river environmental issue recorded in  partially offset by savings from the termination of the company s airplane lease in the third quarter of and other corporate cost reduction efforts 
amortization of intangibles was million in compared to million in the decrease reflects the final amortization of certain intangibles acquired in in the first quarter of  we adopted sfas r

compensation expense related to stock options was million in  of which million was recognized in selling  general and administrative and million was recorded as costs of sales 
this resulted in a reduction to diluted earnings per share of cents in the following table presents the impact of the adoption of sfas r and resulting stock option expense on operating earnings during in millions custom sheet and rollstock packaging technologies color and specialty compounds engineering products corporate in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million non cash goodwill impairment charge due to recent changes in our profiles business and the reorganization of the operations  management and reporting of this business which led to a redefinition of our operating segments comprising our engineered products group and allocation of goodwill to our new profiles reporting unit 
the fair value of our profiles business did not support the million goodwill allocation which resulted in the impairment charge 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million non cash goodwill impairment charge triggered by the underperformance of a profiles business in the engineered products group and the loss of a major customer at another operation in our color and specialty compounds segment 
in the fourth quarter of  we initiated a plan to consolidate three color and specialty compounds production facilities into one plant in donora  pennsylvania 
this restructuring activity  which was completed in the fourth quarter of  resulted in million of cash restructuring expense in primarily related to equipment moving and employee severance costs 
in the second quarter of  we began construction of a new custom sheet and rollstock production facility in greenville  ohio into which three existing production facilities will be consolidated 
this consolidation resulted in million of restructuring expense in primarily related to employee severance costs and accelerated depreciation 
in the second quarter of  we initiated several strategic changes to enhance short term operating performance and longer term operating efficiencies 
the plan involved the consolidation  sale or closing of seven plant facilities  the shut down of a calendered film line and other cost reduction efforts including the termination of the company s airplane lease 
these activities resulted in million of restructuring and exit costs in of which million represented non cash charges 
operating earnings for were million compared to million in representing a million increase which was primarily caused by a million increase in gross margin and an million decrease in restructuring and exit costs  both due to the various reasons previously discussed 
interest expense  net was million in compared to million in the decrease in interest expense was due to the benefit realized from our significant debt pay down in the second half of and through including the extinguishment of our convertible subordinated debentures 
the lower debt levels were partially offset by a higher average interest rate 
in the third quarter of  we redeemed all million of our convertible subordinated debentures resulting in million of early payment premium and million of non cash write off of unamortized debt issuance costs which were reported in total as early debt extinguishment costs 

table of contents our effective tax rate was in compared to in the effective rates for both periods were higher due to the impact of non deductible goodwill impairment charges 
excluding the non deductible portion of goodwill impairment charges  our effective tax rate was in and in the effective tax rate declined when compared to the rate due to the reduction in the amount of valuation allowance recorded for net operating losses generated by our donchery  france operation in compared to partially offsetting the rate improvements outlined above  the effective tax rate was higher in by due to the impact on the effective rate from the implementation of certain state tax planning strategies last year  due the expensing of stock options from the adoption of sfas r in and due a reduction in research and development credits from to we did not record the benefit of a research and development tax credit during calendar because this credit expired on december  in december  the government approved legislation that extends the credit retroactively and as a result  we recovered this benefit in the first quarter of we reported net earnings of million in compared to million in these amounts reflect the impact of the items previously discussed 
custom sheet and rollstock segment net sales were million and million for and  respectively  representing an increase in this increase was caused by underlying volume disposition of business price mix the increase in underlying volume is primarily due to additional sales of lower priced pallet material to this segment s largest customer and incremental sales from our mexico operation to a large customer selling to the home appliance market 
the disposition of business impact represents pounds lost from the sale of our corrugated sheet business in the fourth quarter of the price mix impact reflects the management of selling prices for changes in raw material and conversion costs  partially offset by the mix impact of an increase in volume sold of lower per pound priced products 
this segment s operating earnings in were million which compared to million in this increase was largely driven by higher volume sold  an increase in material margin from our focused efforts to manage margins for changes in resin and the reduction in conversion costs per pound sold  partially offset by an increase in selling  general and administrative expense 
although the reduction in conversion costs per pound sold largely reflects lower per pound labor related expenses  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was due to higher labor related costs 
improvements from our ramos arizpe  mexico and donchery  france sheet operations contributed to the operating earnings increase in compared to the prior year as these operations continue to benefit from increased sales volume and improved operational efficiencies 
packaging technologies segment net sales were million and million for and  respectively  representing a increase in this increase was caused by underlying volume price mix the increase in underlying volume is primarily due to additional sales to the food packaging sector of the packaging market

the higher conversion costs reflected increased freight and utility costs partially offset by lower labor related expenses  and the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was due to higher labor related costs 

table of contents color and specialty compounds segment net sales were million and million in and  respectively  representing a increase 
this increase was caused by underlying volume price mix approximately of sales dollars and of sales volume of this segment represents proprietary products which include engineered compounds and color concentrates which are made using formulas and manufacturing processes that are proprietary in nature 
the remaining sales of this segment represents tolling product  which is customer provided material that we compound for a conversion fee 
the decrease in underlying volume in compared to the prior year reflects a decrease in sales of both tolling and proprietary products 
sales volumes of tolling products decreased due to customer specific decreases in their business volumes 
the decrease in sales volumes of proprietary products reflects disruptions associated with our donora consolidation efforts  particularly in the first and third quarters of the current year  which required us to temporarily decrease our capacity while we physically moved production lines 
the move of production lines from our former production facilities to our donora facility substantially occurred in the first and third quarter of this year 
the price mix increase reflects increases of selling prices for changes in raw material and conversion costs and a favorable shift in mix towards higher sales price per pound products 
this segment s operating earnings in were million which compared to million in the same period of the prior year 
the increase in operating earnings for both periods was impacted by a decrease in special items and the impact of stock option expense associated with the implementation of sfas r 
excluding the impact of special items and stock option expense  operating earnings increased million in over the prior year 
this increase was driven by an increase in mix of higher margin sales and an increase in material margin dollars due to our focused efforts to manage margins for changes in resin and certain conversion costs  partially offset by higher conversion costs and an increase in selling  general and administrative expense 
the higher conversion costs reflected higher freight and utility costs and the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was due to higher labor related costs as well as the impact of the million increase to the lower passaic river environmental accrual 
engineered products group net sales were million and million for and  respectively  representing a sales decrease in this decrease was caused by underlying volume price mix the underlying volume decrease reflects the sale of assets of an operation which was part of our restructuring activities 
excluding the negative volume impact of these sold assets  underlying volume decreased in from the prior year 
this decrease reflects lower sales volume of wheels to the lawn and garden market and a lower volume sold of profile products to the building and construction market 
the positive impact of price mix reflects the management of selling prices for changes in raw material and conversion cost fluctuations as well as a favorable shift in mix towards wheels with a higher selling price per pound 
this segment s operating earnings in were million which compared to an operating loss of million in the increase in operating earnings was impacted by a reduction in special items and the impact of stock option expense associated with the adoption of sfas r 
excluding the impact of special items and stock option expense  operating earnings increased million in compared to the prior year 
this increase was mostly driven by profitability improvement in our wheels and profiles businesses resulting primarily from reductions in labor related costs 
corporate corporate includes corporate expenses and portions of information technology and professional fees that are not allocated to the segments and group 
corporate expenses are reported as selling  general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
corporate expenses as a component of operating earnings were million in and million in the prior year 
the comparison for both periods was impacted by a reduction in special items and stock option expense associated with the impact of sfas r 
excluding the impact of special items and stock option expense  corporate expenses decreased million in due mostly to savings from the termination of the company s airplane lease in the third quarter of  partially offset by an increase in labor related costs and higher it related cost from our company wide oracle information system implementation 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash flow our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operating activities  borrowings from third parties and equity offerings 
our principal uses of cash have been to support our operating activities  invest in capital improvements  pay off outstanding indebtedness  finance strategic business and outsourcing acquisitions  acquire treasury shares and pay dividends on our common stock 
the following summarizes the major categories of our changes in cash and cash equivalents in  and cash flows in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used for investing activities net cash used for financing activities effect of exchange rate changes decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in the prior year 
of the million decrease in cash flow  million was from a larger improvement in net working capital in the prior year and the remainder reflects lower current year earnings 
we continued to focus on managing working capital in the current year 
our inventory turns improved to times at october from times at october and our days payable outstanding improved to days at october from days at october these improvements drove a reduction in our working capital as a percentage of trailing two months of net sales metric from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal our days sales outstanding increased to days at october from days at october due to an increase in sales mix to customers with longer payment terms 
our inventory turns  days payables outstanding and days sales outstanding metrics are calculated using trailing two month averages 
our primary investing activities are capital expenditures 
capital expenditures are primarily incurred to enhance our facilities for safety and environmental improvements  to improve productivity  and to modernize and expand facilities 
capital expenditures in were million compared to million in the million increase in capital expenditures was largely attributable to the new production facility in greenville  ohio  the expansion of our mexico operation and additional capital for our information systems implementation 
net cash used for financing activities totaled million in and million in the net cash used for financing activities during reflects million for treasury share repurchases and million to pay dividends  partially offset by million received from employee stock option exercises and million from additional borrowings 
during the fourth quarter of  we borrowed million to fund the creative acquisition 
financing arrangements in the third quarter of  we amended our us unsecured bank credit facility agreement which increased our total availability from million to million and extended the term to june  interest on the bank credit facility is payable at a rate we may choose of either the prime rate or libor plus a to borrowing margin  and requires a fee of to on the unused portion of the facility 
we classify borrowings under the amended bank credit facility as long term because no paydowns are required within the next months and we have the ability to keep the balances outstanding over the next months 
the bank credit facility requires the company to meet certain affirmative and negative covenants which include minimum consolidated net worth  minimum interest coverage and maximum total leverage requirements 
in the third quarter of  we completed a million private placement of senior notes which are payable on june  the notes do not require annual principal payments and are pre payable at our option after june  at par 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually on december and june of each year 
we used the proceeds from these notes and our new unsecured bank credit facility to redeem our million convertible subordinated debentures 
we incurred million of early payment premiums and million of non cash write offs of unamortized debt issuance costs as early debt extinguishment costs in the third quarter of related to the redemption of these debentures 
as of november   we had million of outstanding debt with a weighted average interest rate of of which represented fixed rate instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 
at the end of  we had million unused on our credit facilities of which million was available under our most restrictive covenant 
our credit facilities contain certain affirmative and negative covenants  including restrictions on the incurrence of additional 
table of contents indebtedness  limitations on both the sale of assets and merger transactions  and requirements to maintain certain financial  debt service and net worth ratios 
while we were in compliance with our covenants throughout and currently expect to be in compliance with our covenants in the next twelve months  our failure to comply with the covenants or other requirements of our financing arrangements could result in an event of default and  among other things  acceleration of the payment of our indebtedness  which could adversely impact our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we anticipate that cash flows from operations  together with the financing and borrowings under our bank credit facilities  will provide the resources necessary for reinvestment in our existing business  strategic acquisitions and managing our capital structure on a short and long term basis 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of november  and the estimated payments due by period in millions less than years years greater than contractual obligations total year and and years long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other obligations total amounts included in long term debt include principal and interest payments 
interest on debt with variable rates was calculated using the current rate of that particular debt instrument at november  purchase obligations primarily consist of inventory purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements 
other obligations consist primarily of a guarantee to enter into a financing agreement in return for government investment subsidies 
the obligations table does not include long term contingent liabilities  deferred compensation obligations and liabilities related to deferred taxes because it is not certain when these liabilities will become due 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as such  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  shareholders equity  revenues and expenses  and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
accounting policies  estimates and judgments which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition we recognize revenue as product is shipped and title passes to the customer 
we manufacture our products either to standard specifications or to custom specifications agreed upon with the customer in advance  and we inspect our products prior to shipment to ensure that these specifications are met 
we monitor and track product returns  which have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established 
despite our efforts to improve our quality and service to customers  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same or better return rates than we have in the past 
any significant increase in returns could have a material negative impact on our operating results 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s creditworthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon any specific customer collection issues identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  actual credit loss rates may differ from our estimates 
inventories we value inventories at the lower of i cost to purchase or manufacture the inventory or ii the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we also buy scrap and recyclable material including regrind material to be used in future production 
we record these inventories initially at purchase price  and based on the inventory aging and other considerations for realizable value  we write down the carrying value to market value where appropriate 
we review inventory on hand and record provisions for obsolete inventory 
a significant increase in the demand for our raw materials could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases  while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  most of our business is custom products  where the loss of a specific customer could increase the amount of excess or obsolete inventory on hand 
although we make efforts to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and operating results 

table of contents acquisition accounting we have made several acquisitions in recent years 
all of these acquisitions have been accounted for in accordance with the purchase method  and accordingly  the results of operation were included in our consolidated statement of operations from the respective date of acquisition 
the purchase price has been allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities  and any excess of the cost over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the initial allocation of purchase price is based on preliminary information  which is subject to adjustments upon obtaining complete valuation information 
while the delayed finalization of a purchase price has historically not had a material impact on the consolidated results of operations  we cannot guarantee the same results in future acquisitions 
goodwill our formal annual impairment testing date for goodwill is the first day of the company s fourth quarter and prior to the next annual testing date if an event occurs or circumstances change that would make it more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process which requires us to make judgmental assumptions regarding fair value 
the first step consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit using a number of judgmental factors including projected future operating results and business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows  discount rates and comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping 
we compare the estimated fair values of each reporting unit to the respective carrying values which includes allocated goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  the second step is completed to compute the impairment amount by determining the implied fair value of goodwill 
this determination requires the allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any remaining unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill which is compared to the corresponding carrying value to compute the goodwill impairment amount 
we believe our estimates of the underlying components of fair value are reasonable 
however  should actual results not meet our expectations or assumptions change in future years  our impairment assessment could result in a lower fair value estimate which could result in an impairment charge that may materially affect the carrying value of our assets and results from operations 
long lived assets we review the carrying amounts of property  plant and equipment  other intangible assets and other long lived assets for potential impairment if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in evaluating the recoverability of a long lived asset  such assets are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets  and we compare the carrying value of each asset group with the corresponding estimated undiscounted future operating cash flows 
in the event the carrying value of an asset group is not recoverable by future undiscounted operating cash flows  impairment exists 
in the event of impairment  an impairment charge would be measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset group exceeds its fair value 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities  applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets are recognized for credit carryforwards and then assessed to determine the likelihood of realization 
valuation allowances are established to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized 
expectations of future earnings  the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  the ability to carryback losses and credits to offset taxable income in a prior year  and tax planning strategies are the primary drivers underlying our evaluation of valuation allowances 
deferred tax amounts recorded may materially differ from the amounts that are ultimately payable and expensed if our estimates of future earnings and outcomes of treasury and tax planning strategies are ultimately inaccurate 
deferred income taxes are not provided for undistributed earnings on foreign consolidated subsidiaries  to the extent that such earnings are reinvested for an indefinite period of time 
if those undistributed foreign earnings were not considered indefinitely reinvested  we would be required to recognize approximately million to million of additional income tax expense 
we accrue for tax contingencies when it is probable that a liability to a taxing authority has been incurred and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated 
the tax contingency is adjusted for changes in circumstances and additional uncertainties  such as significant amendments to existing tax law 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which accruals have been established  or are required to pay amounts in excess of recorded reserves  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted 
in june  the fasb issued fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin requires financial statement recognition of the impact of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not to be sustained on examination  based on the technical merits of the position 
the company has analyzed fin  which will be adopted at the beginning of fiscal  and has determined that it will not have a material impact on the financial statements 

table of contents contingencies we are involved in litigation in the ordinary course of business  including environmental matters 
our policy is to record expense for contingencies when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
estimating probable losses requires assessment of multiple outcomes that often depends on management s judgments regarding  but not limited to  potential actions by third parties such as regulators 
the final resolution of these contingencies could result in expenses different from current accruals and therefore have a material impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period 
for additional information regarding our significant accounting policies  as well as the impact of recently issued accounting standards  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing activities 
our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations in interest rates on our floating rate debt facilities 
at november   we had million of debt subject to variable short term interest rates and million of fixed rate debt outstanding 
based upon the november  balance of the floating rate debt  a hypothetical ten percent increase in interest rates would cause an immaterial change in future net earnings  fair values and cash flows 
we are not currently engaged in any interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
the fair market value of our fixed rate debt is subject to changes in interest rates and the november  fair values of such instruments are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we do not anticipate material changes to the fair value of our debt in the next months 
we are also exposed to market risk through changes in foreign currency exchange rates  specifically the canadian dollar  euro and mexican peso 
based upon our november  currency exposure  a hypothetical ten percent weakening of the us dollar in each currency would cause an immaterial change in future earnings  fair values and cash flows 
see item a for additional disclosures about market risk
