item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to help the reader gain a better understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
it is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our financial statements and accompanying notes 
executive summary fiscal year was a very challenging year 
our results of operations for the year ended march  were materially affected by continued deteriorating market conditions impacting our homebuilding operations 
in recent months  the mortgage markets have also deteriorated due to elevated levels of defaults on sub prime mortgages held by some lenders 
this created a broader mortgage market disruption and a general tightening of mortgage underwriting guidelines that has impacted our homebuilding and mortgage lending operations 
a summary of our results of operations is as follows for the years ended march  revenues earnings loss from continuing operations earnings from discontinued operations net earnings revenues for the year ended march  decreased to billion as compared to the year ended march  earnings loss from continuing operations for the year ended march  decreased to a loss of million 
the decrease in our revenues and the loss from continuing operations during the year ended march  are primarily attributable to deteriorating market conditions affecting our homebuilding operations 
beginning in fiscal year  many us housing markets began to experience a significant downturn  which has directly affected our business and results of operations 
we believe the principal factors that have resulted in this downturn include each of the following  the impact of which varies based upon geographic market and product segment a decline in homebuyer demand due to lower consumer confidence in the consumer real estate market and a decrease in the affordability of housing in selected markets  increased inventory of new and existing homes for sale  and pricing pressures resulting from the imbalance between supply and demand 
the decline in homebuyer demand can be attributed to concerns of prospective buyers of new homes about the direction of home prices  which has increased general uncertainty as to whether now is the best time to buy a home 
the increase in inventory of new and existing homes is in part a result of speculative investors becoming net sellers of homes rather than net buyers  as well as the inability of prospective buyers of new homes to sell their existing homes 
the decrease in affordability of housing in selected markets reflects significant price appreciation in those markets over the past several years 
these deteriorating market conditions materially impacted our operating results as compared to the prior year and are primarily attributable to the following adverse developments in our homebuilding operations a million decrease in homebuilding revenues  net of discounts  a million increase in write offs of land deposits and pre acquisition costs  million in impairments to land under development  and million in our share of joint ventures impairments and our decision to exit one joint venture 
in addition  customer cancellations in our homebuilding operations continue to be significantly higher than historic levels  which have resulted in declines in sales orders net of cancellations of our homes in a majority of markets 
for the years ended march  and  cancellation rates were and  respectively 
our homebuilding operations have also experienced a significant decline in operating margin primarily attributable to discounts and sales incentives and other actions taken in response to local market conditions  which were not offset by 
table of contents commensurate cost reductions 
as a percentage of revenues  closing and financing costs have increased from to and sales commissions have increased from to 
in addition  customer discounts increased to of housing revenues for the year ended march   up from for fiscal year financial services operating results for the year ended march  were relatively unchanged as compared to the prior year 
several factors contributed to financial services ability to balance the negative impact of the unfavorable market conditions discussed above an increase in the percentage of mortgage loans provided to home building s customers from to  while the total number of originated mortgage loans decreased  primarily as a result of a decrease in retail mortgage loans originated  the average originated mortgage loan size increased  average income per loan from the sale of mortgage servicing rights increased  and selling  general and administrative expenses were reduced 
these positive trends were offset by decreases in interest margin and title policy income 
recent changes in the mortgage market that have reduced the availability of certain loan programs designed for higher risk borrowers did not have a significant impact on financial services operating results for the year ended march  however  this shift in the mortgage market has and will continue to reduce the population of potential mortgage customers 
in addition  the decline in homebuyer demand as discussed above could have a negative impact on financial services future operating results 
we will continue to focus on serving our homebuilding customers and increasing operating efficiencies provided by the origination of retail loans 
we expect that our business and results of operations will continue to be affected by the current downturn in us housing markets  at least for the near term 
further deterioration in market conditions would result in declines in sales of our homes  accumulation of unsold inventory and margin deterioration  as well as potential additional impairments and write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs 
we believe the long term fundamentals that support homebuyer demand remain solid and the current market conditions will moderate over time  however  we cannot predict the duration and severity of the current market conditions 
we have adjusted our operations in response to market conditions by reducing our unsold inventory  generating cash from operations  lowering our costs and reducing our land position 
our unsold inventory has decreased from  units as of march  to  units as of march  our cost reduction initiatives include pursuing a reduction in costs from our suppliers and contractors 
during the year ended march   we generated approximately million in cash flows from operating activities and increased our unrestricted cash position as of march  to approximately million 
as further discussed below  in fiscal  we disposed of centex construction group  inc  which we refer to as construction services  and centex home equity company  llc  which we refer to as home equity  consistent with our strategy to focus on our core homebuilding operations and related activities 
on march   we sold construction services to an unrelated third party and received million in cash  net of related expenses and as adjusted for the estimated settlement of post closing adjustments 
in connection with the sale  all intercompany accounts with construction services were repaid and settled 
prior to the sale of construction services  cash generated by the operations of construction services was frequently used to finance the operations of our other businesses 
after the sale of construction services  we no longer have access to this source of internal financing 
on july   we sold home equity to an unrelated third party and received million in cash  net of related expenses and as adjusted for the settlement of post closing adjustments  which includes the repayment of certain intercompany amounts 
the purchase price consisted of a payment based on the book value of the company  plus a premium calculated in accordance with agreed upon formulas and procedures 
for additional information regarding the sales of construction services and home equity  refer to note o  discontinued operations  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents fiscal year compared to fiscal year home building the reduction in our portfolio of businesses has resulted in changes in our internal organization 
as a result of the recent changes in our organization  we have determined that our reporting segments have also changed 
all prior year segment information has been revised to conform to the current year presentation 
within our homebuilding operations  we have determined that our operating segments are our divisions  which have been aggregated into seven reporting segments 
home building consists of the following reporting segments east  southeast  central  texas  northwest  southwest and other homebuilding 
in connection with the change in our reporting segments at march   we have reclassified certain general and administrative expenses from home building to our other reporting segment to be consistent with the structure of our internal organization 
prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
the following summarizes the results of our home building operations for the two year period ended march  dollars in thousands except per unit data and lot information for the years ended march  change change revenues housing revenues land sales and other cost of sales housing cost of sales land sales and other selling  general and administrative expenses earnings loss from unconsolidated entities and other operating earnings operating earnings as a percentage of revenues housing operations total homebuilding operations earnings loss from unconsolidated entities and other includes our share of joint ventures impairments and our decision to exit one joint venture 
operating earnings represent home building s earnings exclusive of certain corporate general and administrative expenses 
operating earnings from housing operations is a non gaap financial measure  which we believe is useful to investors for the reasons described in our previous reports filed with the sec  including our current report on form k filed on january  operating earnings from housing operations is equal to housing revenues less housing cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses  all of which are set forth in the tables above 

table of contents for the years ended march  change change units closed east southeast central texas northwest southwest other homebuilding average revenue per unit east southeast central texas northwest southwest other homebuilding total home building revenues housing revenues decreased for the year ended march  as compared to fiscal year primarily due to decreases in units closed 
for the year ended march   average revenue per unit which is net of customer discounts increased slightly as a result of price increases being largely offset by increases in discounts and pricing pressure experienced in many of our markets 
customer discounts increased to of housing revenues for the year ended march   up from for fiscal year for the year ended march   our closings declined when compared to the prior year as a result of decreases in sales orders caused principally by increased cancellations and decreased customer traffic 
this decrease in closings is a direct result of the challenging market conditions as outlined in the executive summary above 
revenues from land sales and other increased to million for the year ended march  as compared to the prior year 
the timing and amount of land sales vary from period to period based on several factors  including changes in the projected needs of our homebuilding operations and the location  size  availability and desirability of the land we own in each market 
the execution of our capital management strategy results in sales of parcels of land from time to time 
in addition  our resort and second home operations sell land in the normal course of conducting their operations 
based on current market conditions  we have increased our land sales in an effort to address our oversupply of land in certain markets 
changes in average operating neighborhoods and closings per average neighborhood are outlined in the table below 
for the years ended march  change change average operating neighborhoods closings per average neighborhood we define a neighborhood as an individual active selling location targeted to a specific buyer segment with greater than ten homes remaining to be sold 
the increase in average operating neighborhoods for the year ended march  is a result of closing out of neighborhoods at a slower rate as compared to the prior year due to a deceleration in sales 
for the year ended march   we opened new neighborhoods and closed out of neighborhoods 
for the year ended march   we opened new neighborhoods and closed out of neighborhoods 

table of contents operating margins homebuilding operating margins consisting of operating earnings or loss as a percentage of revenues declined to for the year ended march  as compared to for the year ended march  the decrease in homebuilding operating margins as compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to the following factors decreases in revenues  an increase in write offs of land deposits and pre acquisition costs  impairments to land under development  and our share of joint ventures impairments and our decision to exit one joint venture 
the losses from joint ventures are the primary cause of the significant decrease in earnings from unconsolidated entities and other when compared to the prior year 
homebuilding operating margins were significantly impacted by a million increase in cost of sales land sales and other 
we periodically reassess our land holdings  including our lot options  and evaluate potential market opportunities while taking into consideration changing market conditions and other factors 
during the year ended march   and in particular the third and fourth quarters  we determined it was probable we would not exercise certain lot option contracts  which resulted in a write off of certain deposits and pre acquisition costs 
these determinations were made in light of increased housing inventory  a decline in homebuyer demand  increased cancellations and deteriorating market conditions in the homebuilding industry 
the deteriorating market conditions have also resulted in significant land impairments 
in connection with our quarterly neighborhood assessments  during the quarter ended march   we reviewed approximately  housing projects and land investments for potential impairments 
approximately  of these housing projects are owned land positions that are either designated as active neighborhoods or are under development and are not considered active neighborhoods 
the remaining housing projects represent controlled land positions approved for purchase 
during fiscal year  we recorded impairments on neighborhoods and land investments 
also during fiscal year  we wrote off deposits and pre acquisition costs related to option contracts  resulting in outstanding option contracts and deposits including contracts in the due diligence process at march  the following tables summarize home building s write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs and impairments included in cost of sales land sales and other dollars in thousands for the years ended march  impairments write offs impairments write offs east southeast central texas northwest southwest other homebuilding we will continue to assess our land holdings considering the challenging market conditions 
continued deterioration in demand and market conditions could result in a decision to not exercise additional lot option contracts and a reevaluation of our land holdings  which may result in additional write offs and impairments 
in addition  we could incur additional losses and impairments through our joint ventures 
please refer to inventory valuation in the critical accounting estimates and to note c  inventories  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our land holdings 

table of contents operating margins also decreased due to increases in operating segments selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended march  due to increases in advertising  marketing and sales commissions to stimulate sales in light of current housing industry conditions as outlined below 
this increase in selling related expenses was offset by decreases in compensation and benefit costs  including bonuses and profit sharing 
the following table summarizes home building s selling  general and administrative expenses dollars in thousands for the years ended march  change change compensation and benefits sales commissions advertising and marketing other selling  general and administrative expenses sg a as a percentage of revenues sales orders  backlog units and land holdings the following tables summarize sales orders and backlog units for the years ended march  change change sales orders in units east southeast central texas northwest southwest other homebuilding sales per average neighborhood as of march  change change backlog units east southeast central texas northwest southwest other homebuilding for the year ended march   sales orders declined in all of the regions in which we do business with significant declines in most regions and more moderate declines in the texas and northwest regions 
these declines led to a significant decrease in backlog in substantially all regions 
we expect that the decreases in sales orders in fiscal year will significantly reduce our closings in the near term 
as previously discussed  some of the factors we believe are contributing to the decrease in sales orders and backlog are a continued decline in homebuyer demand due to lower consumer confidence in the consumer real estate 
table of contents market and a decrease in the affordability of housing in selected markets  increased inventory of new and existing homes for sale  and pricing pressures resulting from the imbalance between supply and demand 
these factors are evidenced by lower customer traffic and increased cancellation rates 
for the year ended march  and  cancellation rates were and  respectively 
in light of the challenging market conditions  our strategy in fiscal year was to focus on increasing our inventory turns and generating cash 
as a result  we increased advertising costs  sales commissions and sales incentives to help stimulate sales orders and sell our existing inventory 
we also curtailed housing starts so that we could reduce our speculative inventory 
we have also taken the necessary steps to reduce our land position 
the following table summarizes our land position as of march  and as of march  lots lots owned lots controlled total lots owned lots controlled total lots east southeast central texas northwest southwest other homebuilding change we decreased our total land position every quarter during fiscal year with the most pronounced declines occurring in lots controlled 
the decrease in our land position for the year ended march  is a result of our decision to decelerate land purchases and new lot option arrangements  as well as our determination that it was probable we would not acquire certain existing lots controlled under option agreements 
we expect our total land position owned or controlled under option agreements at march  to provide land for approximately  and of estimated closings for fiscal years  and  respectively  based on our current closing projections 
included in our total land position are  and  lots controlled through joint venture arrangements as of march  and  respectively 
we have completed due diligence on  lots of the  lots we control including certain of such lots controlled through joint ventures 
generally  lots where we have completed due diligence have more substantial deposits and pre acquisition costs incurred  and the deposits are non refundable 
based on current market conditions  we believe we are oversupplied in total lots in certain markets and will continue to take the necessary steps to reduce our land position 

table of contents regional discussion changes in revenues and operating earnings for our homebuilding reporting segments are outlined in the table below for the years ended march  change change revenues east southeast central texas northwest southwest other homebuilding operating earnings loss east southeast central texas northwest southwest other homebuilding east revenues decreased primarily due to a decrease in units closed when compared to fiscal year the largest decrease in unit closings occurred in the new jersey and washington dc markets 
the decrease in unit closings experienced in the new jersey and washington dc markets were partially offset by increases in unit closings in the north carolina markets 
sales orders in new jersey and washington dc markets also decreased and as compared to the prior year 
the sales orders decrease in the washington dc market can primarily be attributed to a cancellation rate versus in the prior year 
discounts as a percentage of revenues in the east region increased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year operating earnings decreased million as compared to the prior year primarily due to declines in operating earnings in the washington dc and new jersey markets where earnings decreased and  respectively  versus the prior year 
the primary factors that led to the decrease in operating earnings in the washington dc and new jersey markets were decreases in housing margins resulting from additional discounts and sales incentives offered in these markets to stimulate sales orders 
in addition  we recorded million of land impairments and write offs of pre acquisition costs in the washington dc market 
southeast revenues decreased when compared to fiscal year all markets in the southeast region experienced double digit percentage decreases in revenues except for the nashville and west florida markets 
the decrease in revenues for the southeast region is primarily due to a decrease in closings as compared to the prior year  offset slightly by a increase in average revenue per unit 
the decrease in closings is the result of a decrease in sales orders versus the prior year 
we experienced double digit percentage decreases in sales orders in all markets in the southeast region 
the primary factor contributing to the decrease in sales orders was the increase in cancellation rates from in fiscal year to in fiscal year operating earnings for the region decreased million as compared to the prior year 
the most pronounced declines in operating earnings were experienced in the southwest and southeast florida markets  which totaled of the decrease 
the decrease in operating earnings in the southeast florida market is partially the result of million in land impairments and write offs of pre acquisition costs 

table of contents central revenues decreased primarily due to a decrease in units closed as compared to the prior year 
the indianapolis market was the only market within the central region to experience increases in revenues and closings 
all markets within the central region experienced double digit percentage decreases in sales orders when compared to fiscal year  with the most pronounced decline in the columbus market at 
despite an increase in discounts from in the prior year to in the current year  average revenue per unit held relatively stable  with only a decrease over the prior year 
operating earnings decreased million when compared to fiscal year the detroit  minnesota and illinois markets combined for a total of of the total decrease in operating earnings 
the decrease in operating earnings in the detroit  minnesota and illinois markets is partially the result of a million increase in land impairments and write offs of pre acquisition costs 
texas revenues increased as compared to the prior year primarily due to revenue increases in the san antonio and central texas markets of and  respectively  partially offset by a decrease in the dallas fort worth market 
the increase in revenues can be attributed to a increase in average revenue per unit 
all markets within the texas region experienced increases in average revenue per unit with the largest increases in the san antonio and houston markets 
operating earnings increased million as compared to fiscal year the increase in operating earnings is primarily due to an increase in housing margin in all markets in the texas region except for the dallas fort worth market 
the texas region has not been as affected by the challenging market conditions experienced in other regions  which we believe is reflective of the moderate growth rates experienced in this region in prior years 
northwest revenues decreased as compared to the prior year 
double digit percentage decreases in revenues experienced in the reno  denver and sacramento markets were largely offset by double digit percentage increases in the seattle and central valley markets 
closings increased in the northwest region  but were more than offset by an increase in discounts as a percentage of revenues from to in fiscal year operating earnings decreased million when compared to fiscal year the primary contributors to the decrease in operating earnings in the northwest region were a decrease in housing margin and an increase in land impairments and write offs of pre acquisition costs of million as compared to the prior year 
in addition  we recorded million in our share of joint ventures impairments in the sacramento market in fiscal year hawaii  seattle and portland were the only markets within the northwest region to experience slight to moderate increases in housing margin and operating earnings 
southwest revenues decreased primarily due to an decrease in units closed 
the largest decreases in units closed occurred in the southern california markets  but were partially offset by an increase in units closed in the inland empire market 
overall  average revenue per unit increased for the region despite increases in discounts as a percentage of revenue from in fiscal year to in fiscal year in addition  sales orders decreased as compared to the prior year 
all markets within the southwest region experienced double digit percentage decreases in sales orders  and cancellation rates have averaged in fiscal year versus in fiscal year operating earnings decreased million when compared to fiscal year all markets within the southwest region experienced decreases in operating earnings with the exception of the new mexico market 
the most significant decreases were experienced in the southern california and las vegas markets 
the decreases in operating earnings in southern california and las vegas markets can be attributed to decreases in housing margin and increases in land impairments and write offs of pre acquisition costs 
land impairments and write offs of pre acquisition costs in our southern california and las vegas markets totaled million 
in addition  we recorded million in our share of joint ventures impairments and our decision to exit one joint venture in the southern california coastal market in fiscal year 
table of contents other homebuilding other homebuilding is primarily comprised of certain operating segments that are not part of our long term strategy 
the projects in these operating segments will be built out and liquidated 
none of the operating segments included in other homebuilding are significant 
additionally  certain homebuilding ancillary business and certain income and expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments are reported in this segment 
revenues decreased primarily due to the wind down of our salt lake city and greenville columbia south carolina operations 
total revenues for these two divisions were million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year the decrease in revenues was partially offset by an increase in revenues for our resort operations in our texas markets 
operating earnings decreased as additional sales incentives and discounts were used to stimulate sales activity in certain resort markets 
additionally  a million land impairment was recorded for one of our resort projects in the southeast florida market 
financial services the financial services segment is primarily engaged in the residential mortgage lending business  as well as other financial services that are in large part related to the residential mortgage market 
its operations include mortgage lending and other related services for purchasers of homes sold by our homebuilding operations and other homebuilders  title agency services and the sale of title insurance and other insurance products  including property and casualty 
financial services revenues and operating earnings are derived primarily from the sale of mortgage loans  together with all related servicing rights  title and other various insurance coverages  interest income and other fees 
net origination fees  mortgage servicing rights  and other revenues derived from the origination of mortgage loans are deferred and recognized when the related loan is sold to a third party purchaser 
interest revenues on mortgage loans receivable are recognized using the interest actuarial method 
other revenues  including fees for title insurance  mortgage broker and other services performed in connection with mortgage lending activities  are recognized as earned 
in the normal course of our activities  we carry inventories of loans pending sale to third party investors and earn an interest margin  which we define as the difference between interest revenue on mortgage loans and interest expense on debt used to fund the mortgage loans 
our business strategy of selling loans reduces our capital investment and related risks  provides substantial liquidity and is an efficient process given the size and liquidity of the mortgage loan secondary capital markets 
ctx mortgage company  llc originates mortgage loans and sells them to hsf i and investors 
hsf i is a special purpose entity for which we are the primary beneficiary and is consolidated with our financial services segment 
hsf i s debt and subordinated certificates do not have recourse to us 
we do not guarantee the payment of any debt or subordinated certificates of hsf i and are not liable for credit losses relating to securitized mortgage loans sold to hsf i

an increase in interest income was offset by a decrease in revenues from our title operations 
loan funding costs increased as a result of higher short term interest rates 
this increase in funding costs was the primary factor contributing to the increase in cost of sales and the decrease in interest margin for the year ended march  the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended march  is primarily the result of decreases in branch operating  branch support and sales management expenses 
these reductions were partially offset by an increase in additions to the loan origination reserve 
operating margin for the year ended march  declined slightly since revenues only increased slightly and the increase in cost of sales was offset by a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses

refinancing activity accounted for and of its originations for the years ended march  and  respectively 
for the years ended march  and  financial services originated and  respectively  of the non cash unit closings of home building s customers 
in spring  the mortgage markets experienced increased default levels at a number of lenders holding sub prime mortgages as a result of the downturn in the housing market and other conditions 
in order to assess our financial exposure as a result of these developments  we evaluated mortgages recently originated by ctx mortgage company  llc which we believe represent higher risk sub prime mortgages 
while there is not an industry wide definition of a sub prime loan  we used customers credit scores  loan to value ratios  and income and asset documentation as guidelines for identifying these mortgages 
we concluded that these identified mortgages did not have the potential for a material impact on our operations 
during our evaluation  we considered the fact that ctx mortgage company  llc sells substantially all of its mortgage loans  which are not brokered to third parties to hsf i  and that we are generally not liable for credit losses related to the mortgage loans held by hsf i 
we do  however  retain liability for representations and warranties made by us in connection with the sale of mortgages to hsf i 
although not material for the year ended march   these developments could reduce the population of potential mortgage customers  and in turn  negatively impact financial services future operating results 
other our other segment includes our home services operations  investment real estate operations  as well as corporate general and administrative expense and interest expense 

table of contents the following summarizes the components of the other segment s loss from continuing operations before income tax dollars in thousands for the years ended march  change change operating loss from home services operations operating earnings from investment real estate operations corporate general and administrative expenses interest expense operating loss our home services revenues increased to million in fiscal year this increase in revenues is the result of an expanded customer base 
we had  pest defense customers as of march  as compared to  in the prior year 
the decrease in our home services division s operating loss for the year ended march  is primarily due to the increase in revenues and leverage in selling  general and administrative expenses 
corporate general and administrative expenses represent corporate employee compensation and benefits  professional services and other corporate costs such as investor communications  insurance  rent  utilities and travel costs 
in connection with the change in our reporting segments at march   we reclassified home building corporate related general and administrative expenses from our home building line of business to our other reporting segment consistent with the structure of our internal organization 
prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
the following table summarizes our general and administrative expenses for the other reporting segment dollars in thousands for the years ended march  change change compensation and benefits professional services rent and utilities travel other general and administrative expenses the decrease in corporate general and administrative expenses in fiscal year is primarily related to decreases in compensation and benefits and in professional services 
the decrease in compensation and benefits is a result of reductions in head count at our corporate offices and decreases in our performance related incentive compensation 
for further information on interest expense  see note a  significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
during the fiscal year ended march   we recorded a tax provision of million as compared to the previous fiscal year s tax provision of million 
our effective tax rate for fiscal year was as compared to the previous year s effective tax rate of during the current fiscal year  we increased our reserve for tax contingencies including interest and penalties  if applicable resulting in a tax provision of million 
excluding the effect of the adjustment to tax reserves  our effective tax rate for the twelve months was as compared to for the same period in the previous year 
the increase in the effective tax rate primarily results from the net impact of various permanent tax differences compared to the decrease in earnings from continuing operations 
additionally  the effective tax rate for fiscal year increased as compared to the previous year due to a nonrecurring tax benefit in fiscal year of million resulting from a payment received from the us treasury that was  effectively  a tax refund 

table of contents as previously noted  we recorded an adjustment to our tax provision during the fiscal year ended march  to increase our reserve for tax contingencies 
the additional reserve primarily relates to proposed internal revenue service adjustments concerning the use of certain net operating losses in our through tax returns 
we have recognized approximately million of tax benefits related to these net operating losses in our previously filed tax returns 
our reserves for tax contingencies are based on estimates of our potential exposure with respect to the tax liabilities that may result from such audits 
however  the outcome for a particular audit cannot be determined with certainty prior to the conclusion of the audit  appeal and  in some cases  litigation process 
in instances when we estimate that either interest and or penalties will be asserted and sustained by a taxing authority  penalties and interest are accrued in the financial statements as a component of the income tax provision 
we believe that our tax return positions are supported and will vigorously dispute these proposed adjustments 
see note j  income taxes  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on tax contingencies 
discontinued operations on july   we sold home equity to an unrelated third party and received million in cash  net of related expenses and as adjusted for the settlement of post closing adjustments  which includes the repayment of certain intercompany amounts 
the purchase price consisted of a payment based on the book value of the company  plus a premium calculated in accordance with agreed upon formulas and procedures 
on march   we sold construction services to an unrelated third party and received million in cash  net of related expenses and as adjusted for the estimated settlement of post closing adjustments 
in connection with the sale  we will also receive an aggregate of million in cash to be paid in annual installments of million over a year period

intercompany revenues and costs and expenses of  thousand and  thousand  respectively  were eliminated 
construction services revenues are impacted by the nature and size of construction projects  the stage of completion and the construction schedule as defined by project owners 
revenues for the year ended march  increased as compared to the prior year primarily due to a substantial increase in backlog in prior periods resulting in a 
table of contents portfolio of larger jobs in terms of size from which revenue was realized 
the increase in operating earnings for the year ended march  is primarily the result of the larger portfolio of jobs and improved job profit margins 
after the sale of construction services  we remain responsible for certain surety bond obligations relating to construction services projects commenced prior to march  these surety bonds have a total face amount of billion  although the risk of liability with respect to these surety bonds has declined as the relevant construction projects are performed 
we estimate that billion of work remains to be performed on these projects 
in connection with certain of these surety bond obligations  we have agreed to provide certain sureties with letters of credit of up to million if our public debt ratings fall below investment grade 
the purchaser of construction services has agreed to indemnify centex against losses relating to such surety bond obligations  including amounts drawn under any such letters of credit 
we also have purchased for our benefit an additional back up indemnity provided by a financial institution with an aa s p and aa moody s credit rating 
the obligation of such financial institution under the back up indemnity is initially subject to a limit of billion  which declines to million over time and terminates in fiscal year compared to fiscal year home building the following summarizes the results of our home building operations for the two year period ended march  dollars in thousands except per unit data and lot information for the years ended march  change change revenues housing revenues land sales and other cost of sales housing cost of sales land sales and other selling  general and administrative expenses earnings from unconsolidated entities and other operating earnings operating earnings as a percentage of revenues housing operations total homebuilding operations for the years ended march  change change units closed east southeast central texas northwest southwest other homebuilding average revenue per unit east southeast central texas northwest southwest other homebuilding total home building 
table of contents revenues increased in fiscal year due to increases in closings and average revenue per unit  along with a greater mix of homes closed in markets with higher average revenue per unit 
all regions experienced increases in closings except for the other homebuilding region 
all regions experienced increases in average revenue per unit 
the increase in unit closings was reflective of an increase in average operating neighborhoods and an increase in closings per average neighborhood as outlined in the table below 
for the years ended march  change change average operating neighborhoods closings per average neighborhood the increase in average operating neighborhoods for the year ended march   was the result of opening new neighborhoods and closing out of neighborhoods 
operating margins improved to for the year ended march  as compared to for the year ended march  the increase in operating margins was reflective of an improvement in housing gross margins and a slight improvement in selling  general and administrative leverage  offset to a lesser extent by a decrease in earnings from land sales and other 
increases in average revenue per unit and continued focus on controlling direct construction costs contributed to the housing gross margin improvement 
national and regional purchasing programs and local cost reduction and efficiency efforts helped partially offset increasing raw material costs experienced throughout fiscal year home building s operating segments selling  general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended march  primarily due to increases in employee count to support neighborhood growth and increased incentive compensation reflective of the growth in operating earnings 
operating earnings from land sales and other decreased to million primarily due to lower margins on fiscal year land sales as compared to fiscal year in fiscal year  we recognized an increase in losses due to the write off of certain option deposits and pre acquisition costs  which increase was reflective of the softening of certain markets 
our cost of land sales and other also included the write off of development costs for neighborhoods where all or substantially all homes had already been closed 
the timing and amount of land sales vary from period to period based on several factors  including the location  size  availability and desirability of the land we own in each market 
in addition  our resort and second home operations sell land in the normal course of conducting their operations

in addition  marketing expenses increased in fiscal year as a result of expansion and growth of our home services operations  which increased home services operating loss 
the decrease in our investment real estate operations operating earnings was primarily related to a reduction in sales of real estate and commercial property over the past two years 

table of contents the following table summarizes our general and administrative expenses for the other reporting segment dollars in thousands for the years ended march  change change compensation and benefits professional services rent and utilities travel other general and administrative expenses the increase in corporate general and administrative expenses in fiscal year was primarily related to professional fees associated with various strategic initiatives  increases in performance based compensation costs as a result of increases in our earnings and returns and increases in insurance related costs

we believe that separate disclosure of the consolidating information is useful because the financial services subsidiaries and related companies operate in a distinctly different financial environment that generally requires significantly less equity to support their higher debt levels compared to the operations of our other subsidiaries  the financial services subsidiaries and related companies have structured their financing programs substantially on a stand alone basis  and centex has limited obligations with respect to the indebtedness of our financial services subsidiaries and related companies 
management uses this information in its financial and strategic planning 
we also use this presentation to allow investors to compare us to homebuilders that do not have financial services operations 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 statement of cash flows  the statements of consolidating cash flows have not been restated for discontinued operations 
as a result  all international homebuilding sold in september and construction services sold in march cash flows are included with the centex cash flows and all home equity sold in july cash flows are included with the financial services cash flows in the table above 
significant components of cash flows from discontinued operations are discussed below 
centex we generally fund our centex operating and other short term liquidity needs through cash provided by operations  borrowings from commercial paper and the issuance of senior debt 
centex s operating cash is derived primarily through home and land sales from our homebuilding operations 
during fiscal year  centex s cash from operating activities was primarily provided by dividends received from financial services and the net reduction in home building inventories 
the cash provided by centex s homebuilding operations reversed a trend of net cash use by these operations in recent years 
included in centex s financing activities for the year ended march  was cash used to fund share repurchases 
in addition  centex s financing activities for the year ended march  included the refinance of scheduled debt maturities  the repayment of short term borrowings and cash received from option exercises

the funds provided by centex s financing activities for the years ended march  and were primarily from debt issued to fund the increased homebuilding activity and share repurchases 

table of contents financial services we generally fund our financial services operating and other short term liquidity needs through committed credit facilities  proceeds from the sale of mortgage loans to hsf i and investors and cash flows from operations 
financial services operating cash is derived through sales of mortgage loans and origination and servicing fees 
during fiscal year  cash was provided by sales of mortgage loans and origination and servicing fees  whereas  during fiscal year  cash was used to fund these mortgage loans 
the funds provided by financial services investing activities in fiscal year was primarily related to the cash proceeds received from the sales of home equity and our technology operations 
this was substantially offset by an increase in funding construction loans and home equity s mortgage loans held for investment prior to its sale see further explanation below 
the funds provided by financial services financing activities in fiscal year were primarily from new debt used to fund the increased mortgage loan activity 
discontinued operations included in centex s operating cash flows were general contracting fees obtained through our construction services segment 
for the year ended march   cash provided by construction services operating cash flows was million 
additionally  construction services had million in cash and cash equivalents when they were sold on march  prior to the sale of construction services  cash generated by the operations of construction services was frequently used to finance the operations of our other businesses 
after the sale of construction services  we no longer have access to this source of internal financing 
included in financial services operating cash flows were funds from securitizations and interest income on mortgage loans held by home equity for investment 
financial services cash provided by investing activities in fiscal year was primarily from a reduction in home equity s mortgage loans held for investment 
home equity originated mortgage loans with the intent to securitize  however  whole loan sales periodically occurred 
during fiscal year  cash was primarily used in financial services investing activities to finance increases in home equity s mortgage loans held for investment 
financial services cash used in financing activities in fiscal year and was primarily from the repayment of debt from the liquidation of home equity s mortgage loans held for investment 
our international homebuilding operations and home equity did not require significant capital resources nor did they provide significant liquidity 
as a result  our liquidity and capital resources have not been materially impacted by the sale of these operations

centex corporation currently has an investment grade credit rating from each of the principal credit rating agencies 
our ability to finance our activities on favorable terms is dependent to a significant extent on whether we are able to maintain our investment grade credit ratings 
we attempt to manage our debt levels in order to maintain investment grade ratings

certain off balance sheet obligations the following is a summary of certain off balance sheet arrangements and other obligations and their possible effects on our liquidity and capital resources 
joint ventures we conduct a portion of our land acquisition  development and other activities through our participation in joint ventures in which we hold less than a majority interest 
these land related activities typically require substantial capital  and partnering with other homebuilders or developers and  to a lesser extent  financial partners  allows home building to share the risks and rewards of ownership and to provide broader strategic advantages 
we account for our investments in joint ventures under the equity method of accounting whereby our investment is increased by contributions and our share of joint venture earnings is reduced by distributions and our share of joint venture losses 
investments in joint ventures in which our interest exceeds have been consolidated

for certain joint ventures  we have contributed additional capital in order to maintain loan to value requirements 
we have guaranteed repayment of a portion of certain joint venture debt limited to our ownership percentage of the joint venture or a percentage thereof 
these amounts represent our maximum exposure related to the joint ventures debt at each respective date 
debt agreements for joint ventures vary by lender in terms of structure and level of recourse 
for certain of the joint ventures  we are also liable  on a contingent basis  through other guarantees  letters of credit or other arrangements with respect to a portion of the construction debt 
certain joint venture agreements require us to guarantee the completion of a project or phase if the joint venture does not perform the required development 
to the extent development costs exceed amounts available under the joint venture s credit facility  we would be liable for incremental costs to complete development 
additionally  we have agreed to indemnify the construction lender for certain environmental liabilities in the case of most joint ventures  and most guarantee arrangements provide that we are liable for our proportionate share of the outstanding debt if the joint venture files for voluntary bankruptcy 
to date  we have not been requested to perform the other contingent arrangements discussed in this paragraph 
critical accounting estimates some of our critical accounting policies require the use of judgment in their application or require estimates of inherently uncertain matters 
our accounting policies are in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles  however  a change in the facts and circumstances of the underlying transactions could significantly change the application of the accounting policies and the resulting financial statement impact 
listed below are those policies that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application 
our critical accounting estimates have been discussed with the members of the audit committee 
inventory valuation land acquisition  land development  and home construction costs include  costs incurred land acquisition and development  direct construction  capitalized interest and real estate taxes  as well as certain estimated costs 
these estimated costs include accruals for estimated costs incurred but not yet paid and estimates of remaining costs 
these estimates are based on homebuilding and land development budgets that are assembled from historical experience and local market conditions 
actual results may differ from anticipated costs due to a variety of factors including  but not limited to  a change in the length of construction period  a change in cost of construction materials and contractors  and a change in housing demand 
to mitigate these factors  we regularly review and revise our construction budgets and estimates of costs to complete 

table of contents on a quarterly basis we assess our neighborhoods  which include housing projects and land held for development and sale  in order to identify underperforming neighborhoods and to identify land investments that may not be recoverable through future operations 
each neighborhood is assessed as an individual project 
this quarterly assessment is an integral part of our local market level processes 
we measure the recoverability of assets by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to its estimated future undiscounted net cash flows 
these evaluations are significantly impacted by the following key assumptions related to the project estimates of average future selling prices  estimates of future construction and land development costs  and estimated future sales rates 
these key assumptions are dependent on project specific local market or submarket conditions and are inherently uncertain 
local market specific factors that may impact our project assumptions include historical project results such as average sales price and sales rates  if closings have occurred in the project  competitors local market or submarket presence and their competitive actions  project specific attributes such as location desirability and uniqueness of product offering  potential for alternative product offerings to respond to local market conditions  and current local market economic and demographic conditions and related trends and forecasts 
these and other factors are considered by our local personnel as they prepare or update the project level assumptions 
the key assumptions included in our estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are interrelated 
for example  a decrease in estimated sales price due to increased discounting may result in a complementary increase in sales rates 
based on the results of our assessments  if the carrying amount of the neighborhood exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows  an impairment is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the project to fair value 
fair value is determined based on discounted estimated cash flows for a neighborhood 
discount rates used in our evaluations are based on a risk free interest rate  increased for estimates of market risks associated with a neighborhood 
market risks considered in our discount rate include  among others geographic location of project  product type for example  multifamily high rise product or single family product  and estimated project life 
for the quarter ended march   discount rates used in our estimated discounted cash flow assessments ranged from to  with an average discount rate of 
our quarterly assessments reflect management s estimates  which we believe are reasonable  however  if homebuilding market conditions and our operating results continue to deteriorate  or if the current challenging market conditions continue for an extended period  future results could differ materially from management s judgments and estimates 
land held under option agreements not owned and other land deposits under certain land option agreements with unaffiliated entities  we pay a stated deposit in consideration for the right to purchase land at a future time  usually at predetermined prices 
we evaluate these entities in accordance with the provisions of fin which require us to consolidate the financial results of a variable interest entity if we are its primary beneficiary 
variable interest entities are entities in which equity investors do not have a controlling financial interest and or the entity is unable to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the owner or investor that absorbs a majority of the variable interest entity s expected losses and or receives a majority of the variable interest entity s expected residual returns 
if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary  we consolidate the assets and liabilities of the variable interest entity 
we determine if we are the primary beneficiary based upon analysis of the variability of the expected gains and losses of the variable interest entity 
expected gains and losses of the variable interest entity are highly dependent upon our estimates of the variability and probabilities of future land prices and the probabilities of expected cash flows and entitlement risks related to the underlying land  among other factors 
we perform our analysis at the inception of 
table of contents each lot option agreement 
local market personnel are actively involved in our evaluation  including the development of our estimates of expected gains and losses of the variable interest entity 
to the extent an option agreement is significantly modified or amended  the agreement is reevaluated pursuant to fin based on our evaluation  if we are the primary beneficiary of those entities with which we have entered into land option agreements  the variable interest entity is consolidated 
to the extent financial statements or other information is available  we consolidate the assets and liabilities of the variable interest entity 
if financial statements for the variable interest entity are not available  we record the remaining purchase price of land in the consolidated balance sheets under the caption  land held under option agreements not owned  with a corresponding increase in minority interests 
see note c  inventories  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the results of our analysis of land option agreements 
in addition to land options recorded pursuant to fin  we evaluate land options in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 product financing arrangements 
when our deposits and pre acquisition development costs exceed certain thresholds  or we have determined it is likely we will exercise our option  we record the remaining purchase price of land in the consolidated balance sheets under the caption land held under option agreements not owned  with a corresponding increase to accrued liabilities 
in addition to the land options recorded pursuant to fin and sfas no 
discussed above  we have other land option deposits for which the underlying asset is not consolidated 
these land option agreements and related pre acquisition costs are capitalized in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects 
land option deposits including those consolidated and pre acquisition costs are expensed if the option agreement terminates  is in default  expires by its terms or if we determine it is probable that the property will not be acquired 
on a periodic basis  we assess the probability of acquiring the land we control under option agreements 
this assessment is performed for each option agreement by local market personnel 
the key factors that impact our assessment include acquiring the land we control under option agreements 
local market housing inventory levels  both existing and new homes  our existing local supply of owned and controlled lots  contract purchase price and terms  evaluation of local regulatory environment and  if not fully entitled  likelihood of obtaining required approvals  and local market economic and demographic factors such as job growth  long and short term interest rates  consumer confidence  population growth and immigration 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over net assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis at january or when management determines that due to certain circumstances the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step process with the first step comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss to be recognized defined as the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill that exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill 
we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining balance of goodwill may not be recoverable 
fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow or market valuation approach 
key assumptions utilized in our discounted cash flow model include estimated future sales levels  estimated costs of sales  varying discount rates over local markets  and working capital constraints as they principally relate to estimated future inventory levels 
material variations of these assumptions may have a significant impact to the carrying value of goodwill 
warranty accruals home building offers a ten year limited warranty for most homes constructed and sold 
the warranty covers defects in materials or workmanship in the first two years of the home and certain designated components or structural elements of the home in the third through tenth years 
home building estimates the costs that may be incurred under its warranty program for which it will be responsible and records a liability at the time each home is closed 
factors 
table of contents that affect home building s warranty liability include the number of homes closed  historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim 
home building periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liability and adjusts the amounts as necessary 
although we consider the warranty accruals reflected in our consolidated balance sheet to be adequate  there can be no assurance that this accrual will prove to be sufficient over time to cover ultimate losses 
loan origination reserve financial services has established a liability for anticipated losses associated with mortgage loans originated based upon  among other factors  historical loss rates and current trends in loan originations 
this liability includes losses associated with certain borrower payment defaults  credit quality issues  or misrepresentations and reflects our judgment of the loss exposure at the end of the reporting period 
although we consider the loan origination reserve reflected in our consolidated balance sheets at march  to be adequate  there can be no assurance that this reserve will prove to be sufficient over time to cover ultimate losses in connection with our loan originations 
this reserve may prove to be inadequate due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or discrete events adversely affecting specific customers or industries 
insurance accruals we have certain self insured retentions and deductible limits under our workers compensation  automobile and general liability insurance policies 
we establish reserves for our self insured retentions and deductible limits based on an analysis of historical claims and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
projection of losses concerning these liabilities is subject to a high degree of variability due to factors such as claim settlement patterns  litigation trends and legal interpretations  among others 
on an annual basis  we engage actuaries to assist in the evaluation and development of claim rates and required reserves for self insurance including reserves related to construction defects and general liability claims 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our insurance accruals and adjust the amounts as necessary 
although we consider the insurance accruals reflected in our consolidated balance sheet to be adequate  there can be no assurance that this accrual will prove to be sufficient over time to cover ultimate losses 
income taxes we account for income taxes on the deferral method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
an accrued liability for potential audit assessments relating to various taxing jurisdictions is reflected in current taxes payable including interest and penalties  if applicable 
the accrued liability is an estimate based on our assessment of the ultimate resolution of these tax positions in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
we periodically assess the adequacy of these liabilities and adjust the amounts  as necessary 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and may be affected by changing interpretations of laws  rulings by tax authorities  certain changes and or developments with respect to audits  and expiration of the statute of limitations 
please refer to note j  income taxes  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of the components of the current year tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin  which defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions as well as guidance regarding the measurement of the resulting tax benefits 
fin requires a company to recognize for financial statement purposes the impact of a tax position  if a tax return position is more likely than not to prevail defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent of being sustained upon audit  based on the technical merits of the tax position 
the interpretation also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
fin will be effective as of the beginning of our fiscal year ending march   with the cumulative effect of the change recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin and estimate that the cumulative effect upon adoption will reduce retained earnings by approximately million

table of contents in september  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab to require registrants to quantify financial statement misstatements that have been accumulating in their financial statements for years and to correct them  if material  without restating 
under the provisions of sab  financial statement misstatements were to be quantified and evaluated for materiality using both balance sheet and income statement approaches 
sab was effective for fiscal years ending after november  the adoption of sab was not material to our results of operations or financial position 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  fair value measurements  which serves to define fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas will be effective as of the beginning of our fiscal year ending march  we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  of adopting sfas on our financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 or sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
under the provisions of sfas  companies may elect to measure specified financial instruments  warranty and insurance contracts at fair value on a contract by contract basis  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
the election  called the fair value option  will enable some companies to reduce the volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently  and it is simpler than using the complex hedge accounting requirements in fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities to achieve similar results 
sfas will be effective for us as of april   however  we may elect to adopt early  effective as of april   if such decision is made prior to the issuance of our financial statements for the three months ended june  we expect that the adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our direct debt obligations and on mortgage loans receivable 
the following analysis provides a framework to understand our sensitivity to hypothetical changes in interest rates as of march  centex we use both short term and long term debt in our financing strategy 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair market value of the debt instrument but do affect our future earnings and cash flows 
we do not have an obligation to prepay any of our fixed rate debt prior to maturity  and as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on the fixed rate debt until we refinance such debt 
as of march   short term debt was billion  the majority of which was applicable to financial services 
the majority of financial services debt is collateralized by mortgage loans including mortgage loans held by hsf i 
we borrow on a short term basis in the commercial paper market under a billion commercial paper program supported by a revolving credit facility with a term expiring in fiscal year  all of which bear interest at prevailing market rates 
the weighted average interest rate on short term borrowings outstanding at march  was 
the maturities of centex s long term debt outstanding at march  were as follows maturities through march  thereafter total fair value centex fixed rate debt average interest rate variable rate debt average interest rate we define centex as a supplemental presentation that reflects the financial services segment as if accounted for under the equity method 

table of contents the maturities of centex s long term debt  including debt of variable interest entities consolidated pursuant to fin  outstanding at march  were as follows maturities through march  thereafter total fair value centex fixed rate debt average interest rate variable rate debt average interest rate we define centex as a supplemental presentation that reflects the financial services segment as if accounted for under the equity method 
financial services financial services enters into interest rate lock commitments  or irlcs with its customers under which it agrees to make mortgage loans at agreed upon rates within a period of time  generally from to days  if certain conditions are met 
initially  the irlcs are treated as derivative instruments and their fair value is recorded on the balance sheet in other assets or accrued liabilities 
the fair value of these loan commitment derivatives does not include future cash flows related to the associated servicing of the loan or the value of any internally developed intangible assets 
subsequent changes in the fair value of the irlcs are recorded as an adjustment to earnings 
to offset the interest rate risk related to its irlcs  financial services executes forward trade commitments 
certain forward trade commitments are not designated as hedges and are derivative instruments 
their initial fair value is recorded on the balance sheet in other assets or accrued liabilities 
subsequent changes in the fair value of these forward trade commitments are recorded as an adjustment to earnings 
financial services enters into certain forward trade commitments designated as fair value hedges to hedge the interest rate risk related to its portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale  including mortgage loans held by hsf i 
accordingly  changes in the fair value of the forward trade commitments and the mortgage loans  for which the hedge relationship is deemed effective  are recorded as an adjustment to earnings 
to the extent the hedge is effective  gains or losses in the value of the hedged loans due to interest rate movement will be offset by an equal and opposite gain or loss in the value of the forward trade commitment 
this will result in no impact to earnings 
to the extent the hedge contains some ineffectiveness  the ineffectiveness is recognized immediately in earnings 
due to the high degree of liquidity in the a mortgage market and the frequency of loan sales  the use of forward sales is an effective economic hedge against changes in market value of both irlcs and mortgage loans held for sale that result from changes in interest rates 
the estimated maturities of financial services long term debt outstanding at march  were as follows maturities through march  thereafter total fair value financial services variable rate debt average interest rate we define financial services as a supplemental presentation that reflects centex financial services  its subsidiaries and related companies 
the estimated maturities of financial services long term debt outstanding at march  were as follows maturities through march  thereafter total fair value financial services variable rate debt average interest rate we define financial services as a supplemental presentation that reflects centex financial services  its subsidiaries and related companies
