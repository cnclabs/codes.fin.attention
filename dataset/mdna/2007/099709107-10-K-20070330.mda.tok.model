actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies and estimates 
asset impairments the carrying value of long lived store assets is evaluated whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
in performing such reviews for recoverability  the company compares the expected cash flows to the carrying value of long lived assets for the applicable stores 
if the expected future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of such assets  the company recognizes an impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value 
expected future cash flows  which are estimated over the assets remaining useful lives  contain estimates of sales and the impact those future sales will have upon cash flows 
future sales are estimated based  in part  upon a projection of each store s sales trend based on the actual sales of the past several years 
additionally  each store s future cash contribution is based upon the most recent year s actual cash contribution  but is adjusted based upon projected trends in sales and store operating costs 
fair value is 
table of contents estimated using expected discounted future cash flows  with the discount rate approximating the company s borrowing rate 
significant deterioration in the performance of the company s stores compared to projections could result in significant additional asset impairments 
the carrying value of non store long lived assets is also evaluated whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
expected future cash flows  which are estimated over each asset s remaining useful life  contain estimates of future cash flows based on projected trends in sales and operating costs 
fair value is estimated using expected discounted future cash flows  with the discount rate approximating the company s borrowing rate 
goodwill impairment pursuant to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas  the company s goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
pursuant to fas  a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment a component  for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by management 
the company s reporting units were identified as the operating segments of domestic borders superstores  waldenbooks specialty retail and corporate  and the regional components of the international operating segment 
the carrying amounts of the net assets of the applicable reporting units including goodwill are compared to the estimated fair values of those reporting units 
fair value is principally estimated using a discounted cash flow model which depends on  among other factors  estimates of future sales and expense trends  liquidity and capitalization 
the discount rate used approximates the weighted average cost of capital of a hypothetical third party buyer 
changes in any of the assumptions underlying these estimates may result in the future impairment of goodwill 
if an impairment is detected due to the carrying value of the reporting unit being greater than the fair value  fas requires that an analysis be completed to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment 
to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to each of the reporting unit s assets and liabilities 
the amount of fair value remaining if any after this allocation is then compared to the recorded value of goodwill 
if the remaining fair value exceeds the recorded value of goodwill  no impairment exists 
if  however  the remaining fair value is less than the recorded value of goodwill  goodwill must be reduced to the amount of remaining fair value  with the reduction being recorded as an expense on the statement of operations 
as of february   the carrying amount of the net assets of the uk reporting unit exceeded its fair value 
the company then allocated the fair value of the uk reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  and based on that allocation  determined that the entire amount of goodwill allocated to the uk reporting unit was impaired  and recorded a charge of million 
as of february   no impairment of domestic goodwill existed 
inventory the carrying value of the company s inventory is affected by reserves for shrinkage  markdowns and non returnable inventory 
projections of shrinkage are based upon the results of regular  periodic physical counts of the company s inventory 
the company s shrinkage reserve is adjusted as warranted based upon the trends yielded by the physical counts 
reserves for non returnable inventory are based upon the company s history of liquidating non returnable inventory 
the markdown percentages utilized in developing the reserve are evaluated against actual  ongoing markdowns of non returnable inventory to ensure that they remain consistent 
significant differences between future experience and that which was projected for either the shrinkage or non returnable inventory reserves could affect the recorded amounts of inventory and cost of sales 
the company includes certain distribution and other expenses in its inventory costs  particularly freight  distribution payroll  and certain occupancy expenses 
in addition  certain selling  general and administrative expenses are included in inventory costs 
these amounts totaled approximately million and 
table of contents million as of february  and january   respectively 
the extent to which these costs are included in inventory is based on certain estimates of space and labor allocation 
leases all leases are reviewed for capital or operating classification at their inception under the guidance of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases fas  as amended 
the company uses its incremental borrowing rate in the assessment of lease classification 
gift cards the company sells gift cards to its customers and records a liability for the face value of all certificates issued and unredeemed within the last months 
for certificates older than months  the company records a liability for a portion of the certificates face value based upon historical redemption trends  and records the related income as a component of other revenue 
to the extent that future redemption patterns differ from those historically experienced  significant variations in the recorded reserves may result 
advertising and vendor incentive programs the company receives payments and credits from vendors pursuant to co operative advertising programs  shared markdown programs  purchase volume incentive programs and magazine slotting programs 
these programs continue to be beneficial for both the company and vendors  and the company expects continued participation in these types of programs 
changes in vendor participation levels  as well as changes in the volume of merchandise purchased  among other factors  could adversely impact the company s results of operations and liquidity 
pursuant to co operative advertising programs offered by vendors  the company contracts with vendors to promote merchandise for specified time periods 
pursuant to the provisions of emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf  vendor consideration which represents a reimbursement of specific  incremental  identifiable costs is included in the selling  general and administrative line on the consolidated statements of operations  along with the related costs  in the period the promotion takes place 
consideration which exceeds such costs is classified as a reduction of the cost of merchandise sold line on the consolidated statements of operations 
additionally  the company has recorded million and million of vendor consideration as a reduction to its inventory balance at february  and january   respectively 
the company also receives credits from vendors pursuant to shared markdown programs  purchase volume programs  and magazine slotting programs 
credits received pursuant to these programs are classified in the cost of merchandise sold line on the consolidated statements of operations  and are recognized upon certain product volume thresholds being met or product placements occurring 
income taxes the company must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
in addition  the calculation of the company s tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
the company recognizes liabilities for anticipated tax issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of whether  and to the extent which  additional taxes will be due 
the company also records a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets arising from certain net operating losses when it is more likely than not that some portion of all of such net operating losses will not be realized 
the company s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially 
table of contents impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings  changes in the expected outcome of audit controversies or changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance

in june  the fasb issued statement of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin requires that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date 
the more likely than not threshold represents a positive assertion by management that a company is entitled to the economic benefits of a tax position 
if a tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits  no benefits of the position are to be recognized 
moreover  the more likely than not threshold must continue to be met in each reporting period to support continued recognition of a benefit 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and is required to be adopted by the company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal although the company will continue to evaluate the application of fin  management does not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
also in june  the fasb ratified the emerging issues task force eitf consensus on eitf issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation eitf 
eitf states that the classification of taxes as gross or net is an accounting policy decision that is dependent on the type of tax and that similar taxes are to be presented in a similar manner 
eitf is effective for reporting periods beginning after december  the company does not expect the adoption of eitf to have an impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements fas 
fas provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities and only applies when other standards require or permit the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities 
fas does not expand the use of fair value measurement 
fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company does not expect the adoption of fas to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
related party transactions the company has not engaged in any related party transactions which would have had a material effect on the company s financial position  cash flows  or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the exposure to these risks is managed though a combination of normal operating and financing activities  which may include the use of derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency exchange contracts 

table of contents interest rate risk the company is subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations  as interest on certain of the company s borrowings is based on variable rates 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to interest rate fluctuations is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
historically  the company had utilized interest rate swaps to achieve this objective  effectively converting a portion of its variable rate exposure to fixed interest rates 
currently  the company has no such agreements in effect 
libor is the rate upon which the company s variable rate debt is principally based 
if libor were to increase for the full year of as compared to  the company s after tax earnings would decrease approximately million based on the company s expected average outstanding debt as of february  foreign currency exchange risk the company is subject to foreign currency exchange exposure for operations with assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
on a normal basis  the company does not attempt to hedge the foreign currency translation fluctuations in the net investments in its foreign subsidiaries 
the company does  from time to time  enter into short term forward exchange contracts to sell or purchase foreign currencies at specified rates based on estimated foreign currency cash flows 
it is the policy of the company not to purchase financial and or derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
at february   the company had no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding
