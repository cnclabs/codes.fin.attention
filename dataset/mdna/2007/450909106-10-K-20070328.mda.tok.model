item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of ibis including notes thereto and selected financial data included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview ibis technology corporation ibis was formed in october and commenced operations in january ibis initial activities consisted of producing and selling simox soi wafers and conducting research and development activities 
this effort led to the development of a proprietary oxygen implanter  the ibis  which we began selling in  the next generation implanter  the i  which we began selling in  and also to other proprietary process technology 
initially  much of our revenue was derived from research and development contracts and sales of wafers for military applications 
over the years  the company decided to focus its business operations and sales strategy on the manufacture and sale of our implanter equipment products and de emphasized the sale of wafers given that  among other things  we believed that the wafer manufacturing companies were in the best position to manufacture simox soi wafers using our implanter equipment in light of their expertise and operating efficiencies 
as we announced on july   we exited the wafer manufacturing business 
wafer product sales  as well as wafer revenue reported in subsequent periods  are reported net of associated costs  as loss from discontinued operations on our income statement 
the company believes that its decision to discontinue the wafer business permits broader strategic collaboration efforts between ibis and the wafer manufacturers 
we reach this conclusion for a number of reasons 
first  we believe that tremendous price pressure exists on commodity type products  such as silicon wafers  and this pressure is already eroding future price expectations of soi wafers 
because the starting wafer represents a significant component of the soi wafer cost  we believe that silicon wafer manufacturers should have a natural cost structure advantage leading to a higher gross margin  and therefore should be able to manage such price pressure better than stand alone soi producers that do not also produce the silicon wafer itself 
second  we expect that the price pressure will encourage silicon wafer manufacturers to seek out higher margin products  like soi wafers  to increase their margins 
third  we believe that silicon wafer manufacturers have traditionally developed proprietary intellectual property in silicon materials science  which can be applied to designing optimal starting wafers for soi production 
we believe that this should give them an advantage in both minimizing wafer cost and maximizing soi wafer quality and yield 
fourth  our experience suggests that silicon wafer manufacturers already have a well developed infrastructure for manufacturing  sale and marketing of large volumes of substrates 
lastly  we believe that there is greater efficiency in producing the soi wafer as part of the wafer manufacturers existing product flow  specifically avoiding the need to repackage  re clean  re inspect and re ship substrates twice  once as starting silicon wafers  and a second time as soi wafers 
therefore  as a result of these trends  we expect our ultimate customers will be drawn from these silicon wafer manufacturers and we plan to focus a majority of our technical and marketing resources on the sale of implanters to the leading silicon wafer manufacturers and our key customers in the semiconductor industry who we believe are the leaders in the adoption of soi technology 
we expect that implanter sales to chipmakers should be minimal  and that these sales will be focused on soi processes that the chipmaker wishes to keep proprietary  such as selective or patterned simox  or other specialty substrates 
our fundamental simox soi technology has been developed  refined  and tested over the last dozen years 
in  we introduced the current generation of simox soi technology  which included our second generation oxygen implanter i and the mld wafer process which was licensed to us by ibm 
we believe that the i s flexibility  automation and operator friendly controls allow this tool to produce a wide range of simox soi wafer products using a range of manufacturing processes  including advantox mld ibis technology corporation part i item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and advantox mld ut wafers 
we also believe the ability of the i implanter to produce twelve inch or mm simox soi wafers coupled with the mld process positions us to capitalize on the growing soi market 
in  we commenced a program to design and develop the i  introduced it in march and began shipping mm wafers implanted from this machine shortly thereafter 
customers who purchase the i can utilize more than one simox wafer manufacturing process on the implanter including the ibm mld process  when licensed  as well as other simox soi wafer manufacturing processes that do not require the ibm license 
because we have sold only a limited number of implanters to date on an irregular basis  the recognition of revenue from the sale of even one implanter is likely to result in a significant increase in the revenue during that quarter 
we recognize implanter revenue in accordance with sab  which includes  among other criteria  the shipment and final customer acceptance of the implanter at the customer s location 
as a result  deferral of implanter revenue will be recorded on our balance sheet until the company is able to meet these criteria 
in january  we announced the booking ie receipt and mutual agreement of terms of an order for one ibis i simox implanter from sumco  a leading international silicon wafer manufacturer 
this system was factory accepted and shipped in the second quarter and we received final customer acceptance of this tool at the customer s site in march in october of we received a second order for an i simox implanter from sumco and negotiated a master purchase agreement that will govern the general commercial terms of future orders from sumco 
this implanter was factory accepted by sumco at ibis facility in the first quarter of the implanter was shipped in april and customer acceptance at the customer s facility occurred in august  with the revenue recognized in the quarter ended september  critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates on matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  inventory valuation and reserves  and the assessment of long lived asset impairment 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
below  we discuss these policies further  as well as the estimates and judgments involved 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from equipment sales and the sales of spare parts when all of the following criteria have been met evidence exists that the customer is bound to the transaction  the product has been delivered to the customer and  when applicable  the product has been installed and accepted by the customer  the sales price to the customer has been fixed or is determinable  and collectibility of the sale price is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue from implanter sales upon final customer acceptance at the customer s site 
revenue derived from contracts and services is recognized upon performance 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with revenue recognized in any period 
management analyzes various factors  including a review of specific transactions  historical experience  credit worthiness of customers and current market and economic conditions 
changes in judgment based upon these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue and cost recognized 
inventory valuation and reserves 
our policy for the valuation of inventory  including the determination of obsolete or excess inventory  requires us to forecast the future demand for our products within specific time horizons  generally twelve months or less 
if our forecasted demand for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly  we could be required to record additional inventory reserves  which would have a negative impact on our gross margin 
we have reserved for obsolescence when engineering changes or other technological advances indicate that obsolescence has occurred 
valuation of long lived assets 
ibis reviews the valuation of long lived assets  including property and equipment and licenses  under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
management is required to assess the recoverability of its long lived assets or asset groups whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
based on current conditions  factors we consider important and that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to book value 
in accordance with sfas no 
 when we determine that the carrying value of applicable long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we evaluate whether the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset or asset group 
if such a circumstance exists  we would measure an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount of the particular long lived asset or group exceeds its fair value 
we would determine the fair value based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
we adopted sfas no 
during the first quarter of and during the fourth quarter of we recognized an impairment charge of million for our mm and smaller simox wafer production line 
we determined the fair market value of the assets as described above 
the remaining value of this line  along with other assets associated with wafer manufacturing were recorded as a loss from discontinued operations in that resulted in a charge of million comprised of disposal costs of million and losses associated with the wafer manufacturing operation of million 
the impairment charge of million was composed of million for property and equipment and 
million for inventory related to the company s smaller size wafer manufacturing business 
the property and equipment had an acquired value of million  accumulated depreciation of million  and net book value of million 
an impairment charge of million reduced this to a carrying value of 
million 
we have physically scrapped the majority of the equipment included in the assets upon which the impairment charge was based  on discontinuance of the wafer operation where this equipment was used 
the remaining book value of the assets held for sale of million  were written off during we are continuing to attempt to sell at nominal values several remaining pieces of equipment that third parties have indicated interest in

included in the total deferred tax assets  offset by the valuation allowance  was million related to the net operating loss carryover resulting from the exercise of employee stock options the tax benefit of which  when recognized  will be accounted for as a credit to additional paid in capital rather than a reduction of income tax expense 
net operating loss carryovers and other tax attributes may be limited in the event of certain changes in ownership interests 
the company recorded and paid massachusetts and california excise and corporate tax which in aggregate was  for fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  contract and other revenue 
contract and other revenue for the fiscal year ended december  was million compared to million for the fiscal year ended december   a decrease of million  or

cost of equipment revenue for the fiscal year ended december  was million  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
this decrease is primarily due to the fact that no implanters were sold during the period ended december  the total cost of sales and revenue for the fiscal year ended december  was million  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
the gross margin for all sales was a negative for the fiscal year ended december   as compared to a positive gross margin of for the fiscal year ended december  this decrease in the gross margin for all sales is attributable to no implanter gross margin for the fiscal year ended december  as compared to the approximate gross margin of for the i implanter sale recognized in the fiscal year ended december  as well as the unabsorbed manufacturing costs and the decrease in cost of inventory reserves 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended december  were million as compared to million for the fiscal year ended december   or no net change 
this is due to decreased securities compliance  decreased premiums on director s officers liability insurance and decreased tax expenses of million each offset by increased professional services  increased payroll and payroll related expenses and increases in other miscellaneous expenses of million each

research and development expenses 
internally funded research and development expenses increased by million  or to million for the fiscal year ended december  from million for the fiscal year ended december  this increase represents the wafer research and development costs of million that were previously part of the cost of sales during the time we manufactured wafers for sale  but are now supporting equipment development  as well as increased repair and maintenance of million and increased r d material expenses of million which were offset by the reduction in depreciation expenses associated with consolidation of our facilities of million 
other income 
total other income for the fiscal year ended december  and fiscal year ended december  were  in each year 
changes within total other income relate to the expiration in the period ended december  of a wafer volume option of million that was associated with an asset obtained by the wafer production group from a wafer customer 
this volume option was to be used on orders received over a one year period 
since the time expired  and no orders were received  the company reduced its liability and recognized the amount in income  as no further obligation exists 
this was offset by the increase in interest income of million in the period ended december  due to increased interest rates  and reduced interest expense and other miscellaneous expenses of million 
discontinued operations 
the loss on disposal in was million and consisted of million in net fixed asset impairments  million in inventory impairments and employee severance pay of thousand 
in  the company recognized a gain on disposal of million consisting primarily of the sale of excess equipment  sale of wafer materials previously written off and an accrual adjustment related to sales tax 
taxes 
ibis had federal net operating loss and general business credit carryovers of approximately million and million  respectively  at december   that may be used to offset future taxable income through  subject to the company s profitability over that time and limits that certain ownership changes  as defined in the internal revenue code  have regarding the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income 
state net operating loss and credit carryovers of million and million  respectively  have varying expiration dates 
net deferred tax assets include million related to the net operating loss carryover results from the exercise of employee stock options  the tax benefit of which  when recognized  will be accounted for as a credit to additional paid in capital rather than a reduction of income tax expense 
net operating loss carryovers and other tax attributes may be limited in the event of certain changes in ownership interests 
the company recorded and paid massachusetts and california excise and corporate tax which in aggregate was  for liquidity and capital resources as of december   ibis had cash and cash equivalents of million  including the final payment of million for the second i simox implanter accepted by sumco in the fiscal year ended december  during the fiscal year ended december   ibis used million of cash for operating activities of continuing operations as compared to million in to date  ibis working capital requirements have been funded primarily through debt capital leases and equity financings  including the february financing discussed below 
the principal uses of cash during the fiscal year ended december   as described in the statement of cash flows on page of this k  were to fund operations and additions to property and equipment 
at december   ibis had commitments to purchase approximately million in material 
our headcount for the year ended december  was employees 
the company s management believes that it will have sufficient cash resources to support current operations until at least june this expectation however  is based on the company s current operating plan and general sales outlook  each of which may change rapidly 
in january  the company announced that to conserve cash it was reducing its operating expenses by approximately which involved cost cutting measures consisting of headcount reductions  consulting at a neighboring business for a minimum of six months under a staffing services agreement  salary reductions and reducing consumable expenses 
on february   the company entered into a purchase agreement pursuant to which it agreed to sell unregistered shares of its common stock and warrants exercisable for common stock to special situation funds for an aggregate purchase price of million in a two tranche financing 
the first closing  at which the company received approximately million in proceeds  occurred on february  subject to stockholder approval  the company agreed to sell the remainder of the securities at a second closing  at which the company will receive approximately million in proceeds 
the second closing is expected to occur after the company s annual stockholder meeting  which is expected to be held on may  with the successful conclusion of the second closing  the company s management believes it will have sufficient cash to support current operations until at least december in connection with the transaction  the company also entered into a registration rights agreement with the investors 
the company will pay a placement fee to a placement agent  which includes a cash fee equal to of the gross proceeds and warrants exercisable for common stock with a dollar value equal to of the gross proceeds 
a payment of approximately  was made and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock were issued to the placement agent in connection with the first closing 
all of the securities will be sold in a private placement pursuant to regulation d of the securities act 
the company intends to continue to invest in research and development and its manufacturing capabilities 
changes in technology or sales growth beyond currently established capabilities may require further investment 
further adoption of the technology and timing of future equipment orders are dependent on the continuing qualification of implanters and improvement programs at the device manufacturers  among other factors 
at present time the company has only one of the four major wafer manufacturers as its current customer 
we currently do not have an order backlog for implanters 
the timing of future orders is important and difficult to predict because customers can delay orders and or request early shipment  either of which could cause the need for additional cash requirements 
forecasting future revenue  on a quarter by quarter basis  remains exceedingly difficult and significant variations  quarter to quarter  are likely 
further  because some of the materials and components the company uses to build its implanter have long lead times  the company may purchase some or all of those long lead items prior to receipt of an order by its customers 
when this is the case  those parts and materials bear the risk of being subject to excess and obsolescence 
the company expects to continue to explore equity offerings and other forms of financing and anticipates that we may be required to raise additional capital in the future in order to finance future growth and our research and development programs 
there can be no assurance however that our actual needs will not exceed expectations or that we will be able to fund our operations on a long term basis in the absence of other sources 
there also can be no assurance that any additional required longer term financing will be available through additional bank borrowings  debt or equity offerings or otherwise  or that if such financing is available  that it will be available on terms acceptable to us 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation s k section a ii 
contractual obligations we have no significant contractual obligations not fully recorded on our balance sheets or fully disclosed in the notes to our financial statements 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation s k section a ii 
at december   our outstanding contractual obligations included payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year year years years more than years minimum operating lease payments additional information regarding our financial commitments at december  is provided in the notes to our financial statements

effects of inflation ibis believes that over the past three years inflation has not had a significant impact on our sales or operating results 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax positions  as defined 
fin seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  fin requires management to perform a two step evaluation of all tax positions  ensuring that these tax return positions meet the more likely than not recognition threshold and can be measured with sufficient precision to determine the benefit recognized in the financial statements 
these evaluations provide management with a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize  measure  present  and disclose in its financial statements certain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on income tax returns 
we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab requires companies to evaluate the materiality of identified unadjusted errors on each financial statement and related financial statement disclosure using both the rollover approach and the iron curtain approach 
the rollover approach quantifies misstatements based on the amount of the error in the current year financial statement whereas the iron curtain approach quantifies misstatements based on the effects of correcting the misstatement existing in the balance sheet at the end of the current year  irrespective of the misstatement s year s of origin 
financial statements would require adjustment when either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that is material 
correcting prior year financial statements for immaterial errors would not require previously filed reports to be amended 
sab is effective for interim periods of the first fiscal year ending after november  we do not expect the adoption of sab to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations which states an entity shall recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
fasb interpretation no 
is an interpretation of fasb statement no 
which clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
thus  the timing and or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event 
accordingly  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the fair value of a liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation should be recognized when incurred generally upon acquisition  construction  or development and or through the normal operation of the asset 
uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
statement no 
acknowledges that in some cases  sufficient information may not be available to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
this interpretation also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company has determined that there is no additional impact from the adoption of this statement
