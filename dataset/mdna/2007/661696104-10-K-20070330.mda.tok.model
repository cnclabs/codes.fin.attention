overview north pointe holdings is an insurance holding company whose insurance company subsidiaries market and service specialty commercial and personal insurance products 
we also have non insurance company subsidiaries that provide administrative  agency and premium finance services 
our revenues are principally derived from premiums earned from our insurance operations 
other revenues are primarily generated through investment income and fees associated with our personal and commercial policies 
our expenses consist primarily of losses and loss adjustment expenses  agents commissions and other underwriting and administrative expenses 
we report consolidated financial information in three business segments commercial lines insurance  personal lines insurance and administrative services 
net income for the years ended december   and was million  million  and million  respectively  resulting in diluted earnings per share of  and  respectively 
net income before extraordinary item for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively  resulting in diluted earnings per share of  and  respectively 
the  increase in net income for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to a million after tax decrease in net loss and loss adjustment expenses  partially offset by a million after tax decrease in net premiums earned 
in addition  net income includes an after tax charge of million related to a figa assessment 
our loss ratios for the years  and were  and  respectively 
the decrease in the loss ratio for both the commercial and personal line segments for compared to is primarily due to the significant hurricane related costs that were incurred in the decrease in net premiums earned primarily resulted from cancellations and non renewals in our commercial lines segment and increased reinsurance costs 
the cancellations and non renewals were the result of our prompt reduction of our wind exposure in florida when it became evident that we could not obtain catastrophe reinsurance coverage for the hurricane season 
we made the decision to reduce our exposure in early june  which was substantially implemented by july by the cancellation or non renewal of all policies included in specific classes within our florida small business line 
we expect this will reduce total annualized gross premiums written in our florida small business line by approximately million  or  and total insurable value with wind exposure by approximately 
net income for includes after tax expenses of million attributable to four hurricanes which struck florida and the us gulf coast in   of after tax expenses attributable to statutory assessments from citizens and  of after tax expenses attributable to reserve adjustments relating to the hurricane losses 
of the million of after tax expenses attributable to hurricanes in  million  million   and million were attributable to hurricanes dennis  katrina  rita and wilma  respectively 
net income for includes an extraordinary gain of million related to the recognition of negative goodwill resulting from the acquisition of north pointe casualty for less than the aggregate fair value of its net assets 
net income for also includes after tax expenses of million attributable to four hurricanes which 
table of contents struck florida in and million after tax gain primarily attributable to the sale of the renewal rights of our non standard automobile line of business in october in  our gross premiums written increased to million from million in  an increase of million or 
our commercial lines gross premiums written increased by million  or  and our personal lines gross premiums written decreased by  or 
the increase in gross premiums written in our commercial lines primarily resulted from crop fronting and flood programs  partially offset by decreased gross premiums written in our florida small business line as a result of the aforementioned cancellations and non renewals 
the decrease in gross premiums written in our personal lines was attributable to decreased policy counts offset by increased average premium per policy 
the decrease in policy count was a result of our efforts to more selectively underwrite the risks 
in  our gross premiums written grew to million from million in  an increase of million  or 
our commercial lines gross premiums written increased by million  or and our personal lines gross premiums written increased by million or 
we experienced continued expansion in our florida small business line which accounted for most of the growth in our commercial lines segment 
we entered the florida homeowners market in december which accounts for the growth in our personal lines segment 
the growth in the florida homeowners line of business was partially offset by a decrease in writings in our personal automobile insurance line  which we exited in october in december  am best upgraded north pointe insurance s financial strength rating from b to a 
simultaneously  am best reaffirmed north pointe casualty s financial strength rating of b  initiated a financial strength rating of b for home pointe insurance  and upgraded the issuer credit rating of north pointe holdings to bb from bb 
in august  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of the company s outstanding common stock 
the repurchase program has a twenty four month time limit  and the timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased will depend on a variety of factors  including corporate and regulatory requirements  price  and other market conditions 
during the year ended december   we had not repurchased any shares under the program 
in june  we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement which replaced a previous amended credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides for a revolving credit line in the aggregate amount of million 
in february  we issued million of year  mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities the trust preferreds through a newly formed  unconsolidated wholly owned subsidiary  np capital trust i the trust 
on september   we completed an initial public offering and raised million net of underwriters discounts and related expenses  including proceeds of an over allotment exercised by the underwriters on november  we contributed million of the net proceeds to our insurance company subsidiaries  utilized million to pay down our senior debt facility and the remainder was used to satisfy a federal income tax amount due north pointe casualty in accordance with our tax sharing agreement 
critical accounting estimates we prepare our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  or gaap 
under gaap  we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements 
as additional information becomes available  these estimates and assumptions can change and impact amounts reported in the future 
we have identified below accounting policies that we use to make these estimates and assumptions 
we consider these policies to be critical due to the amount of judgment and uncertainty inherent in their application 

table of contents estimation of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves represent our best estimate of the ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses that occurred prior to  but were unpaid at  the end of any given accounting period 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of gross loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
evaluation of these gross reserves requires the estimation of loss development over an extended period of time 
numerous factors will affect the ultimate settlement values of claims  including tort reform  expected future inflationary trends  medical costs and jury awards 
these factors  coupled with the character of the business we write much of which is small volume specialty commercial lines  continual changes in the mix of business we write  as well as ongoing rate and underwriting modifications  require that significant judgment be used in the reserve setting process 
for example  our gross premiums written in our rbt line decreased by in  our personal automobile business is now in run off  and we began writing homeowners in florida in these changes in our mix of business  among other less substantial changes  create additional uncertainty in estimating the ultimate loss costs 
due either to insufficient experience or volume in a particular line of business  we are often required to consider industry loss ratios for establishing credible loss ratio expectations 
however  industry loss ratios have tended to run higher than our historical experience partly due to the fact that available industry statistics generally include risks which we do not cover  such as environmental and asbestos liabilities  or they are not specific enough to our particular specialty lines 
we review our reserves by product line  coverage and state on an annual  semiannual  or quarterly basis  depending on the size of the product line or emerging issues related to the coverage 
we also identify and measure variances in trend by state  line of business and coverage that would not otherwise be seen on a consolidated basis 
our analyses are critical not only for the purpose of establishing accurate financial reporting data but also for evaluating pricing and the effectiveness of various product lines or coverages 
we use actuarial methodologies to assist us in establishing these estimates  including estimates of the severity and frequency of future claims  the length of time to obtain an ultimate resolution  outcomes of litigation and other third party factors that are often beyond our control 
due to the inherent uncertainty associated with the cost of unsettled and unreported claims  our ultimate liability may differ from our original estimate 
our reserve estimates are regularly reviewed and updated and any resulting adjustments are included in the current period s results 
see results of operations losses and loss adjustment expenses  business unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  and note to our consolidated financial statements  all of which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
federal income tax expense we provide for federal incomes taxes based on amounts we believe we will ultimately owe 
inherent in the provision for federal income taxes are estimates regarding the deductibility of certain items and the realizations of certain tax credits 
in the event the ultimate deductibility of certain items or the realization of certain tax credits differs from estimates  we may be required to significantly change the provision for federal income taxes recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
in july  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin no 
which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  this interpretation clarifies the uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas statement no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
fin no 
requires that we evaluate our tax positions within the scope of sfas in each tax jurisdiction for all open tax years and determine whether our tax positions are more likely than not of being sustained based solely on technical merits 
fin no 
then requires that we measure the tax benefit or liability to be recognized and record an adjustment to income and retained earnings according to the interpretation 
we adopted fin on january  and have determined that it will not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operation 

table of contents other than temporary impairment of investments sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and staff accounting bulletin  noncurrent marketable equity securities  require companies to perform periodic reviews of individual securities in their investment portfolios to determine whether a decline in the value of a security is other than temporary 
a review for other than temporary impairment otti requires companies to make certain forward looking judgments regarding the materiality of the decline  its effect on the financial statements  and the probability  extent and timing of a valuation recovery  and the company s ability and intent to hold the security 
the scope of this review is broad and requires a forward looking assessment of the fundamental characteristics of a security  as well as market related prospects of the issuer and its industry 
pursuant to these requirements  we assess valuation declines to determine the extent to which such changes are attributable to i fundamental factors specific to the issuer  such as financial conditions  business prospects or other factors or ii market related factors  such as interest rates or equity market declines 
this evaluation reflects our assessments of current conditions  as well as predictions of uncertain future events  that may have a material impact on the financial statements related to security valuation 
fixed income investments with unrealized losses due to the market or industry related declines  are not deemed to qualify as other than temporarily impaired where we have the intent and ability to hold the investment for the period of time necessary to recover a significant portion of the investment s original principal and interest obligation 
our policy for equity securities with market related declines is to recognize impairment losses on individual securities with losses that are not reasonably expected to be recovered under historical market conditions when the security has been in a loss position for four consecutive quarters 
this does not preclude us from recognizing an impairment prior to a security remaining in a loss position for four consecutive quarters if events or evidence would dictate an earlier recognition 
when persuasive evidence exists that causes us to evaluate a decline in market value to be other than temporary  we reduce the book value of such security to its current market value  recognizing the decline as a realized loss in the income statement 
all other unrealized gains or losses are reflected as a change in shareholders equity 
since total unrealized losses are already a component of our shareholders equity  any recognition of additional other than temporary impairment losses would have no effect on our comprehensive income or book value 
as of december   we had unrealized losses on our investment portfolio of million  of which million were in unrealized loss positions for more than twelve months 
if we decided to write down all securities in an unrealized loss position for one year or longer  we would have recognized an additional million of realized losses  reducing net income in by million 
see business investments  and note to our audited consolidated financial statements  all of which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
fair value of net assets acquired during  we reported million of extraordinary gains resulting from our acquisition of north pointe casualty 
in accordance with sfas  business combinations  the extraordinary gain was generated as a result of the estimated fair value of net assets acquired exceeding the purchase price 
significant judgment is required in determining the fair values of net assets acquired 
in our evaluation of the fair values of the net assets acquired pursuant to the above acquisition  we took into account a combination of factors  including the likelihood of recoveries on various assets  as well as the anticipated timing of recoveries 
in the case of the investment portfolio securities  we utilized market values 
in determining the fair value of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses we developed assumptions for the discounting of cash flows and estimates of risk loads a hypothetical arms length buyer would require to assume such liabilities 
fixed and intangible assets were written off before determining the extraordinary gain 
substantially all other assets and liabilities were short term in nature reducing the amount of judgment involved in determining estimated fair value

table of contents reinsurance recoverables reinsurance recoverables represent amounts currently due from reinsurers on paid losses and lae  amounts recoverable from reinsurers on case basis estimates of reported losses and lae  and amounts recoverable from reinsurers on actuarial estimates of ibnr losses and lae 
such recoverables  by necessity  are based upon estimates 
reinsurance does not legally discharge us from our legal liability to our insureds  but it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to us to the extent of the reinsurance ceded 
instead of being netted against the appropriate liabilities  ceded unearned premiums and reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses and lae are reported separately as assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
reinsurance recoverable balances are also subject to credit risk associated with the particular reinsurer 
in our selection of reinsurers  we continually evaluate their financial stability 
while we believe our reinsurance recoverables are collectible  the ultimate recoverable may be greater or less than the amount accrued 
at december  and  reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  and pre paid reinsurance premiums were million and million  respectively 
results of operations we evaluate the performance of our operations by monitoring key measures of growth and profitability 
we measure our growth by examining our gross premiums written 
we measure our profitability by examining our net income  loss ratio  expense ratio and combined ratio 
the following table provides financial results and key measures that we use to evaluate our results

year ended december  as compared to year ended december  gross premiums written for were million as compared to million for  an increase of million  or 
gross premiums written in our commercial lines segment for were million as compared to million for  an increase of million or 
this increase was primarily attributable to million in gross premiums written in our crop fronting program and flood program  which we began in  and a million increase in our bowling centers and roller skating centers lines 
the crop fronting program was discontinued for these increases were partially offset by an million decrease in gross written premiums in our florida small business line  which resulted from cancellations and non renewals  and a million decrease in our restaurant bar tavern  or rbt lines 
the cancellations and non renewals were the result of our prompt reduction of our wind exposure in florida when it became evident that we could not obtain catastrophe reinsurance coverage for the hurricane season 
we made the decision to reduce our exposure in early june which was substantially implemented by july by the cancellation or non renewal of all policies included in specific classes within our florida small business line 
we expect this will reduce total annualized gross premiums written in our florida small business line by approximately million  or  and total insurable value with wind exposure by approximately 
the decrease in our rbt line was attributable to a reduction in policy count resulting from a more competitive market 
while we did not cancel the bowling centers line written in florida  we have reduced our exposure to catastrophe losses in the bowling line through a combination of certain non renewals  higher deductibles and other increased underwriting restrictions 
in addition  we have taken measures to substantially increase rates on the bowling line  as well as our other florida commercial lines which we are retaining  including contractor and rbt lines

these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in our rbt line and a  decrease in our accident and health line which we ceased writing in may the decrease in gross premiums written in our rbt line was a result of the loss of several liquor liability and general liability policyholders in michigan which we attribute to a more competitive market

we ceased writing personal automobile policies in october upon the sale of our renewal rights to that line of business 
the average annual premiums per policy for the florida homeowners insurance line is approximately of the average annual premiums per policy that we obtained from our personal automobile insurance line

table of contents liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of funds north pointe holdings corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own 
consequently  our ability to pay dividends to shareholders  meet our debt payment obligations and pay our taxes and administrative expenses is dependent on intercompany service agreements with  and dividends from  our subsidiaries  including our insurance company subsidiaries 
our insurance company subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation by insurance regulatory agencies in each state in which they do business  including restrictions on the amount of dividends they can pay to their shareholder 
see liquidity and capital resources capital constraints  incorporated elsewhere within this annual report on form k 
there are no restrictions on the payment of dividends to us by our non insurance company subsidiaries other than state corporate laws regarding solvency 
as a result  our non insurance company subsidiaries generate revenues  profits and net cash flows that are generally unrestricted as to their availability for payment of dividends 
we may use these revenues to service our corporate financial obligations  such as debt service  shareholder dividends or acquisitions 
our administrative segment is comprised of the operations of our non insurance company subsidiaries 
our primary assets are the stock of north pointe financial a non insurance company and the stock of our insurance companies 
our ability to pay dividends to shareholders  meet our debt payment obligations and pay our general and administrative expenses is largely dependent on cash dividends we receive from north pointe financial 
in turn  north pointe financial s primary source of revenue  from which dividends to us have been paid  is the service fees and commissions it receives from our insurance companies pursuant to various servicing  marketing and management agreements in effect between those entities 
in addition  it is possible that north pointe financial could receive dividends from our insurance companies paid out of their retained earnings  which north pointe financial could then pay to us as dividends 
however  we traditionally have not issued dividends from our insurance companies to fund our general expenses and debt payment obligations 
moreover  holding company laws regulate dividends and other payments by our insurance companies 
our non insurance companies provide management and administrative services to our insurance company subsidiaries pursuant to intercompany service agreements 
these services include providing management  marketing  offices and equipment  and premium collection  for which our insurance companies pay our non insurance companies fees primarily based on a percentage of gross premiums written 
in exchange for providing these intercompany services  our non insurance companies recorded revenues of million  million  and million  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our non insurance companies also derive nonaffiliated revenues from installment fees  commissions from nonaffiliated insurance carriers  premium financing and other income which totaled million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
there were no material non cash components of our non insurance company revenues 
all of the agreements between our regulated insurance company subsidiaries and our non insurance company subsidiaries have been approved by the applicable regulators 
the primary obligations of our non insurance companies are salary and administrative expenses and debt service obligations 
our non insurance companies incurred salary and administrative expenses of million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our minimum principal and interest payments on our bank debt were million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
approximately million  million and million of our net income for the years ended december   and  respectively  was derived from our non insurance companies which constitute our administrative services segment 
our insurance and non insurance operating subsidiaries principal sources of funds are insurance premiums  investment income  proceeds from the maturity and sale of invested assets and installment fees 
these funds are primarily used to pay claims  commissions  employee compensation  taxes and other operating expenses  and to service debt  purchase investments and pay dividends to us 

table of contents we generally expect to pay claims and other expenses from operating cash flows 
historically  cash and cash equivalents ie  investments having an original maturity of days or less have comprised at least of our investment portfolio  and our current investment guidelines require us to maintain this level of liquidity 
we also seek to stagger the maturities of our investments so that we have access to maturing instruments on a regular basis 
in addition  we seek to invest at least of our investment portfolio in highly liquid  fixed income securities having an average duration of less than four years 
we believe that managing our cash and investments in the foregoing manner limits our exposure to losses resulting from the untimely sale of securities due to unanticipated cash requirements 
cash flows net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for  an increase of million 
the increase in cash from operations was attributable to a combination of factors including a million decrease in net losses and loss adjustment expenses paid there were no hurricanes in  a million decrease in taxes paid  and a million increase in investment income 
these increases in cash were offset by a million reduction in net premiums collected  and million increase in cash paid for policy acquisition costs as well as operating and interest expense 
the million reduction in net premiums collected resulted from receiving cash in the fourth quarter of relating to florida homeowners policies renewing in the first quarter of because the entire florida homeowners line was new in the first half of  there were no similar premiums paid in advance in december  thus all premiums from our florida homeowners policies written in the first quarter of were collected in the same period while a portion of the florida homeowners policies written in the first quarter of were paid in late net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million as compared to  for  an increase of million 
the increase in cash from operations was attributable to a combination of factors including an increase in net premiums collected of million and an increase in investment income of million 
these increases in cash were partially offset by an increase in net losses and loss adjustment expenses paid of million  an increase in federal income taxes paid of million and a  reduction in cash received from other income 
losses and loss adjustment expenses paid in and were significantly impacted by the florida hurricanes  much of which was recoverable from reinsurers 
our reinsurance recovered on paid losses was million and million in and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million and was attributable to million of net cash used in investment portfolio purchases in excess of investment portfolio sales and other dispositions   of cash used for the capital contribution to np capital trust i an unconsolidated delaware trust used to issue trust preferred securities  and million of cash used to purchase fixed assets 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million and was attributable to a million net decrease in cash from investment portfolio purchases in excess of investment portfolio sales  million of net cash used to acquire northwestern zodiac and  used to acquire fixed assets 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million and was attributable to million in proceeds net of  of issuance costs received from the issuance of the subordinated debentures in conjunction with the issuance of the trust preferred securities  partially offset by a million decrease in the net senior debt borrowings 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million and was attributable to million in net proceeds provided from the initial public offering partially offset by a million reduction in net borrowings 
in  the company contributed  and  to north pointe casualty and home pointe insurance  respectively  substantially derived from the net proceeds of the issuance of the trust preferred securities 
we believe that existing cash and investment balances  as well as cash flows from operation  will be adequate to meet the capital and liquidity needs of north pointe holdings and each of its subsidiaries during the month 
table of contents period following the filing of this annual report on form k 
we currently anticipate meeting our long term capital and liquidity needs through a combination of cash flows from operations and possible future debt or equity financings 
no assurances can be given  however  that we will generate cash flows from operations sufficient to meet our ongoing financial requirements or that debt or equity financing will be available to us upon acceptable terms  if at all  in the future 
capital constraints writings to surplus ratios our ability to write additional insurance policies is largely dependent on the statutory leverage of our insurance company subsidiaries 
michigan insurance regulations require insurance companies to maintain a gross premium writings to capital and surplus ratio under to florida insurance regulations require insurance companies to maintain a net premiums to capital and surplus ratio rather than a gross premiums to capital and surplus ratio under to statutory capital and surplus is defined as total assets less total liabilities of insurance companies determined in accordance with statutory accounting principles 
north pointe insurance s gross premiums written to statutory capital and surplus ratios were to and to as of december  and  respectively 
north pointe casualty s net premiums written to statutory capital and surplus ratios were to and to  as of december  and  respectively 
risk based capital the national association of insurance commissioners  or naic  has adopted risk based capital  or rbc  requirements that require insurance companies to calculate and report information under an rbc formula 
the rbc formula attempts to measure statutory capital and surplus needs based on the risks in an insurance company s mix of products and investment portfolio 
the rbc formula is used by state insurance regulators to monitor trends in an insurance company s statutory capital and surplus  for the purpose  if necessary  of initiating regulatory action 
our insurance companies  except for midfield  are required to submit a report of their rbc levels to the insurance departments of their states of domicile as of the end of the previous calendar year 
as of december   all of our insurance companies had rbc levels in excess of an amount that would require any regulatory intervention 
regulations on dividends paid by insurance companies state insurance laws restrict the ability of our insurance company subsidiaries to declare dividends to us 
michigan and florida have regulations  outlined below  which provide guidance as to when an insurance company may pay a dividend 
the district of columbia does not have detailed regulations  but provides a broader guideline which leaves much of the judgment in the hands of the insurance commissioner in the district of columbia 
in addition to the regulations outlined below  insurance departments will also look to financial measurements such as writings to surplus ratios  rbc levels or iris ratios when determining whether to approve a dividend 
in  north pointe insurance declared a  stock dividend 
in  north pointe insurance paid a million ordinary dividend 
none of our other insurance companies have paid dividends in the last three years 
under the michigan holding company law  our michigan insurance company  north pointe insurance  can only declare or pay dividends from its earned surplus  unless the michigan insurance regulator approves the dividend prior to payment 
in addition  our michigan insurance company must obtain prior approval from the michigan insurance regulator before it may pay extraordinary dividends or distributions to its shareholder  north pointe financial 
in michigan  an extraordinary dividend or distribution includes any dividend or distribution of cash or other property if the fair market value of the cash or other property  together with that of other dividends or distributions made within the preceding months  exceeds the greater of of the insurer s surplus as of december of the preceding year or the net income of the insurer  not including realized capital gains  for the twelve month period ending december of the preceding year  in each case determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices 
dividends or distributions falling below this threshold are considered ordinary shareholder dividends 
ordinary shareholder dividends declared by our michigan insurer must be reported to the michigan insurance regulator at least ten days before they are paid  but these dividends are not subject to prior approval 
michigan s insurance law would allow north pointe insurance to pay up to million in ordinary dividends in nonetheless  the michigan insurance regulator retains the right to deny any dividend  extraordinary or otherwise 
accordingly  we typically obtain prior approval on all dividend distributions from north pointe insurance 

table of contents under the florida holding company law  our florida insurance companies north pointe casualty and home pointe insurance can only declare or pay dividends out of that part of its available and accumulated surplus funds that is derived from its realized net operating profits on its business and net realized capital gains 
in addition  our florida insurance companies must obtain prior approval from the florida insurance regulator before it may pay extraordinary dividends or distributions to its shareholder  north pointe financial 
in florida  an extraordinary dividend or distribution includes any dividend or distribution that exceeds either of the following two thresholds the larger of the lesser of of the insurer s surplus or net income not including realized capital gains plus a two year carryforward  of surplus  with dividends payable constrained to unassigned funds minus of unrealized capital gains  or the lesser of of surplus or net investment income plus a three year carryforward with dividends payable constrained to unassigned funds minus of unrealized capital gains 
this threshold applies if the insurer does not provide prior notice of the dividend to the florida insurance regulator and does not certify that  following payment of the dividend  the insurer s surplus will equal or exceed of the surplus required under applicable florida statutes 
the larger of of the insurer s surplus derived from realized net operating profits on its business and net realized capital gains  or the insurer s entire net operating profits and realized net capital gains derived during the immediately preceding calendar year 
this threshold applies if the insurer provides prior notice of the dividend to the florida insurance regulator  which notice certifies that  following payment of the dividend  the insurer s surplus will equal or exceed of the surplus required under the applicable florida statutes 
dividends or distributions falling below these thresholds are not subject to prior approval by the florida insurance regulator 
florida s insurance law would allow for north pointe casualty and home pointe to pay any dividends of  and  respectively without prior regulatory approval in under district of columbia law  insurance companies can only dividend an amount which is deemed to be in excess of the amount required by the commissioner 
there is not a specific formula defining an ordinary dividend versus an extraordinary dividend 
accordingly  all dividend payments must be approved by the district of columbia department of insurance  securities and banking

issuance of trust preferred securities on february   we issued million of year  mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities the trust preferreds through a newly formed  unconsolidated wholly owned subsidiary  np capital trust i the trust 
the trust preferreds mature on march   but may be redeemed at our option beginning on march  the trust preferreds require quarterly distributions  at a fixed rate of per annum for five years  and thereafter at a variable rate  reset quarterly  at the three month libor rate plus 
distributions are cumulative and will accrue from the date of original issuance  but may be deferred for up to consecutive quarterly periods 
the proceeds of the trust preferreds received by the trust  along with proceeds of  paid by us to the trust from the issuance of common securities by the trust to us  were used to purchase million of our junior subordinated debt securities the debt securities under terms which mirror those of the trust preferreds 
we primarily invested the million of proceeds  which is net of  of issuance costs  in high grade debt securities which will remain available to fund future contributions to our subsidiaries  acquisition activities as they may arise  and other capital uses 
in june and september  we contributed million and million of the funds  respectively  to north pointe casualty to meet the minimum statutory capital and surplus of million required by many states for surplus lines carriers 
in december  we contributed million to home pointe insurance to meet statutory capital and surplus levels required by am best for their initial rating 
we obtained consents and waivers from our senior lenders acknowledging that the purchase of our equity interest in and issuance of subordinated debt securities to np trust and the guaranty of the np trust s preferred securities would not constitute an event of default under the senior credit facility

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential economic loss principally arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
we believe that interest rate risk and credit risk are the two types of market risk to which we are principally exposed 
interest rate risk our investment portfolio consists principally of investment grade  fixed income securities  all of which are classified as available for sale 
accordingly  the primary market risk exposure to our debt securities is interest rate risk 
in general  the fair market value of a portfolio of fixed income securities increases or decreases inversely with changes in market interest rates  while net investment income realized from future investments in fixed income securities increases or decreases along with interest rates 
in addition  some of our fixed income securities have call or prepayment options 
this could subject us to reinvestment risk should interest rates fall and issuers call their securities  requiring us to reinvest at lower interest rates 
we attempt to mitigate this interest rate risk by investing in securities with varied maturity dates and by managing the duration of our investment portfolio to a defined range of three to four years 
the effective duration of our portfolio as of december  was years 
the table below summarizes our interest rate risk illustrating the sensitivity of the fair value of fixed income investments to selected hypothetical changes in interest rates as of december  the selected scenarios are not predictions of future events  but rather illustrate the effect that events may have on the fair value of the fixed income portfolio and shareholders equity 
hypothetical percentage estimated increase decrease in hypothetical change in interest rates estimated change in shareholders as of december  fair value fair value fair value equity dollars in thousands basis point increase basis point increase no change basis point decrease basis point decrease credit risk an additional exposure to our fixed income securities portfolio is credit risk 
we attempt to manage our credit risk by investing primarily in investment grade securities 
in addition  we comply with applicable statutory requirements  which limit the portion of our total investment portfolio that we can invest in any one security 
as of december   we were primarily invested in us government securities  us government agencies and investment grade corporate bonds 

table of contents we are subject to credit risks with respect to our reinsurers 
although a reinsurer is liable for losses to the extent of the coverage which it assumes  our reinsurance contracts do not discharge our insurance companies from primary liability to each policyholder for the full amount of the applicable policy  and consequently our insurance companies remain obligated to pay claims in accordance with the terms of the policies regardless of whether a reinsurer fulfills or defaults on its obligations under the related reinsurance agreement 
to mitigate our credit risk to reinsurance companies  we attempt to select financially strong reinsurers with an am best rating of a or better and continue to evaluate their financial condition throughout the duration of our agreements 
at december   amounts due us from reinsurers were million 
we believe all amounts recorded as due from reinsurers are recoverable 
effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation has a material effect on our results of operations  except for the effect that inflation may have on interest rates and claims costs 
we consider the effects of inflation in pricing and estimating reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the actual effects of inflation on our results are not known until claims are ultimately settled 
in addition to general price inflation  we are exposed to a long term upward trend in the cost of judicial awards for damages  as well as short term spikes in local prices attributable to increases in demand which may impact the severity of our losses in future periods 
for example  construction costs in florida increased significantly during as a result of increased demand stemming from the hurricanes which struck florida in and this is also referred to as demand surge
