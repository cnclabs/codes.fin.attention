item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein and is based primarily on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and overview as of december  we managed our portfolio within nine geographic segments pennsylvania west  pennsylvania north  new jersey  urban  richmond  virginia  california north  california south  mid atlantic and southwest 
the pennsylvania west segment includes properties in chester  delaware and montgomery counties in the philadelphia suburbs of pennsylvania 
the pennsylvania north segment includes properties north of philadelphia in berks  bucks  cumberland  dauphin  lehigh and montgomery counties 
the new jersey segment includes properties in counties in the southern and central parts of new jersey including burlington  camden and mercer counties and in bucks county  pennsylvania 
the urban segment includes properties in the city of philadelphia  pennsylvania and the state of delaware 
the richmond  virginia segment includes properties primarily in albemarle  chesterfield and henrico counties  the cities of richmond and durham  north carolina 
the california north segment includes properties in the cities of oakland and concord 
the california south segment includes properties in the cities of carlsbad and san diego 
the mid atlantic segment includes properties in northern virginia and the cities of bethesda and rockville  maryland 
the southwest segment includes properties in dallas and travis counties of texas 
we receive income primarily from rental revenue including tenant reimbursements from our properties and  to a lesser extent  from the management of properties owned by third parties and from investments in the real estate ventures 
our financial performance is dependent upon the demand for office  industrial and other commercial space in our markets and prevailing interest rates 
through our january acquisition of prentiss  we acquired interests in properties that contain an aggregate of million net rentable square feet 
through this acquisition  we also entered into new markets  including markets in california  metropolitan washington  dc  and texas 
accordingly  the reported historical financial information for periods prior to this transaction is not believed to be fully indicative of our future operating results or financial condition 
as we seek to increase revenue through our operating activities  our management also seeks to minimize operating risks  including i tenant rollover risk  ii tenant credit risk and iii development risk 
tenant rollover risk we are subject to the risk that tenant leases  upon expiration  are not renewed  that space may not be relet  or that the terms of renewal or reletting including the cost of renovations may be less favorable to us than the current lease terms 
leases accounting for approximately of our aggregate annualized base rents as of december  representing approximately of the net rentable square feet of the properties expire without penalty in we maintain an active dialogue with our tenants in an effort to maximize lease renewals 
our retention rate for leases that were scheduled to expire in was 
if we are unable to renew leases or relet space under expiring leases  at anticipated rental rates  our cash flow would be adversely impacted 
tenant credit risk in the event of a tenant default  we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as a landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment 
our management regularly evaluates our accounts receivable reserve policy in light of our tenant base and general and local economic conditions 
our accounts receivable allowance was million or of total receivables including accrued rent 
table of contents receivable as of december  compared to million or of total receivables including accrued rent receivable as of december  development risk as of december   we had in development or redevelopment nine sites aggregating approximately million square feet 
we estimate the total cost of these projects to be million and we had incurred million of these costs as of december  we are actively marketing space at these projects to prospective tenants but can provide no assurance as to the timing or terms of any leases of space at these projects 
as of december   we owned approximately acres of undeveloped land 
risks associated with development of this land include construction cost increases or overruns and construction delays  insufficient occupancy rates  building moratoriums and inability to obtain necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy and other required governmental approvals 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting periods 
certain accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies  as they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and changes in the accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for a summary of all of our significant accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
revenue recognition we recognize rental revenue on the straight line basis from the later of the date of the commencement of the lease or the date of acquisition of the property subject to existing leases  which averages minimum rents over the terms of the leases 
certain lease agreements contain provisions that require tenants to reimburse a pro rata share of real estate taxes and common area maintenance costs 
real estate investments real estate investments are carried at cost 
we record acquisition of real estate investments under the purchase method of accounting and allocate the purchase price to land  buildings and intangible assets on a relative fair value basis 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the useful lives of buildings and capital improvements to years and over the shorter of the lease term or the life of the asset for tenant improvements 
direct construction costs related to the development of properties and land holdings are capitalized as incurred 
we expense routine repair and maintenance expenditures and capitalize those items that extend the useful lives of the underlying assets 
real estate ventures when we obtain an economic interest in an entity  we evaluate the entity to determine if the entity is deemed a variable interest entity vie  and if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary  in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r 
if the entity is not deemed to be a vie  and we serve as the general partner within the entity  we evaluate to determine if our presumed control as the general partner is overcome by the kick out rights and other substantive participating rights of the limited partners in accordance with eitf  determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights eitf 

table of contents we consolidate i entities that are vies and of which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and ii entities that are non vies which we control 
entities that we account for under the equity method ie at cost  increased or decreased by our share of earnings or losses  less distributions include i entities that are vies and of which we are not deemed the primary beneficiary and ii entities that are non vies which we do not control  but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence 
we will reconsider our determination of whether an entity is a vie and who the primary beneficiary is if events occur that are likely to cause a change in the original determinations 
impairment of long lived assets our management reviews investments in real estate and real estate ventures for impairment if facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
measurement of any impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset  determined using customary valuation techniques  such as the present value of expected future cash flows 
in accordance with sfas no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets  such as real estate investments and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities relating to assets classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
income taxes the company has elected to be treated as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
in addition  we have several subsidiary reits 
in order to maintain their qualification as a reit  the company and its reit subsidiaries are required to  among other things  distribute at least of its reit taxable income to its stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature of its income and assets 
as reits  the company and its reit subsidiaries are not subject to federal income tax with respect to the portion of its income that meets certain criteria and is distributed annually to the stockholders 
accordingly  no provision for federal income taxes is included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to the operations of these operations 
the company and its reit subsidiaries intend to continue to operate in a manner that allows them to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as reits 
many of these requirements  however  are highly technical and complex 
if the company or one of its reit subsidiaries were to fail to meet these requirements  the company would be subject to federal income tax 
the company is subject to certain state and local taxes 
provision for such taxes has been included in general and administrative expenses in the company s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 
we may elect to treat one or more of our subsidiaries as a taxable reit subsidiary trs 
in general  a trs of the company may perform additional services for our tenants and generally may engage in any real estate or non real estate related business except for the operation or management of health care facilities or lodging facilities or the provision to any person  under a franchise  license or otherwise  of rights to any brand name under which any lodging facility or health care facility is operated 
a trs is subject to corporate federal income tax 
we have elected to treat certain of our corporate subsidiaries as trss  these entities provide third party property management services and certain services to tenants that could not otherwise be provided 
at december   our trss had tax net operating loss nol carryforward of approximately million  expiring from to we have ascribed a full valuation allowance to our net deferred tax assets 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts that represents an estimate of losses that may be incurred from the inability of tenants to make required payments 
the allowance is an estimate based on two calculations that are combined to determine the total amount reserved 
first  we evaluate specific accounts where we have determined that a tenant may have an inability to meet its financial obligations 
in these situations  we use our judgment  based on the facts and circumstances  and records a specific reserve for that tenant against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount that we expect to collect 
these reserves are re evaluated and adjusted as additional information becomes available 
second  a reserve is established for all tenants based on a range of percentages applied to receivable aging categories 
if the financial condition of our tenants were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
deferred costs we incur direct costs related to the financing  development and leasing of our properties 
management exercises judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed 
capitalized financing fees are amortized over the related loan term and capitalized leasing costs are amortized over the related lease term 
management re evaluates the remaining useful lives of leasing costs as the creditworthiness of our tenants and economic and market conditions change 
purchase price allocation we allocate the purchase price of properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on fair values 
above market and below market in place lease values for acquired properties are recorded based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and ii our estimate of the fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancellable term of the lease 
capitalized above market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining non cancellable terms of the respective leases 
capitalized below market lease values are amortized as an increase of rental income over the remaining non cancellable terms of the respective leases  including any fixed rate renewal periods 
other intangible assets also include amounts representing the value of tenant relationships and in place leases based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and our overall relationship with the respective tenant 
we estimate the cost to execute leases with terms similar to the remaining lease terms of the in place leases  include leasing commissions  legal and other related expenses 
this intangible asset is amortized to expense over the remaining term of the respective leases 
we estimate fair value through methods similar to those used by independent appraisers or by using independent appraisals 
factors that we consider in our analysis include an estimate of the carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
we also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre acquisition due diligence  marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
in estimating carrying costs  we include real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods  which primarily range from three to twelve months 
characteristics that we consider in allocating value to our tenant relationships include the nature and extent of our business relationship with the tenant  growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant  the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals 
the value of tenant relationship intangibles is amortized over the remaining initial lease term and expected renewals  but in no event longer than the remaining depreciable life of the building 
the value of in place leases is amortized over the remaining non cancellable term of the respective leases and any fixed rate renewal periods 
in the event that a tenant terminates its lease  the unamortized portion of each intangible  including market rate adjustments  in place lease values and tenant relationship values  would be charged to expense

table of contents total revenue revenue increased by million primarily due to the acquired properties primarily prentiss  which represents million of this increase 
the increase is also the result of properties placed in service  including cira centre  which contributed million to this increase 
the increase in total revenue from our same store properties of million is primarily attributable to increased occupancy as well as increased tenant reimbursements resulting from higher property operating expenses 
operating expenses and real estate taxes property operating expenses increased by million primarily due to the acquisition of prentiss and other properties  which represents million of this increase 
property operating expenses attributable to the increased occupancy of cira centre and other completed developments resulted in an additional million of property operating expense 
real estate taxes increased by million primarily due to the acquisition of prentiss and other properties  which represents million of this increase 
the remainder of the increase primarily is the result of increased real estate tax assessments in our same store portfolio and properties placed in service 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization increased by million primarily due to the acquisition of prentiss and other properties  which increased total portfolio depreciation expense by million 
a significant portion of the increase  million  is also due to accelerated depreciation expense associated with the demolition of one of our properties as part of an office park development in suburban philadelphia 
this property was part of our same store portfolio  therefore the remaining increase in depreciation and amortization for our same store portfolio is million 
this increase resulted from the timing of assets being placed in service upon completion of tenant improvement and capital improvement projects subsequent to the end of the nine month period ending september  the depreciation and amortization for our development properties increased by million as a result of timing of the properties being completed and placed into service 
administrative expenses administrative expenses increased by approximately million primarily due to the acquisition of prentiss 
of this increase  million was primarily attributable to increased payroll and related costs associated with employees that we hired as part of the acquisition of prentiss 
we also incurred an additional million in professional fees in connection with our merger integration activities 
the remainder of the increase reflects other increased costs of the combined companies which includes an increase in deferred compensation expense of million 
interest income expense interest expense and deferred financing costs increased by approximately million primarily as a result of fixed rate mortgages  three unsecured notes  and one note secured by us treasury notes pprefi debt that we assumed or entered into to finance the prentiss merger 
the mortgages assumed have maturity dates ranging from through and the unsecured notes have maturities ranging from through the pprefi debt had a maturity of february  but we elected to prepay this debt in november the pprefi debt was defeased by prentiss in the fourth quarter of and was secured by an investment in us treasury notes 
the interest earned on the treasury notes is included in interest income and 
table of contents substantially offsets the amount of interest expense incurred on the pprefi debt  resulting in an immaterial amount of net interest expense incurred 
the increase of million in interest income is primarily attributable to the interest income earned on these treasury notes 
see the notes to consolidated financial in part iv  item for details of our mortgage indebtedness and unsecured notes outstanding 
gain on termination of purchase contract we held a fifty percent economic interest in an approximately  square foot office building located at paragon drive  montvale  new jersey 
the remaining fifty percent interest was held by donald e 
axinn  one of the company s trustees 
although we and mr 
axinn had each committed to provide one half of the million necessary to repay the mortgage loan secured by this property at the maturity of the loan  in february an unaffiliated third party entered into an agreement to purchase this property for million 
as a result of the purchase by an unaffiliated third party during august  we recognized a million gain on termination of its rights under a contribution agreement  modified in  that entitled the partnership to the interest in the joint venture to operate the property 
minority interest partners share of consolidated real estate ventures minority interest partners share of consolidated real estate ventures represents the portion of income from our consolidated joint ventures that is allocated to our minority interest partners 
as of december  we held an ownership interest in properties through consolidated real estate ventures  compared to two properties owned by consolidated real estate ventures at december  minority interest attributable to continuing operations lp units minority interest attributable to continuing operations lp units represents the equity in loss income attributable to the portion of the operating partnership not owned by us 
the increase from the prior year is primarily the result of the fact that at december  the lp units share in our net loss from continuing operations compared to their share of net income from continuing operations in the prior year 
minority interests owned and of the operating partnership as of december  and  respectively 
the change in minority interest ownership is primarily the result of the class a units that we issued in the prentiss acquisition 
discontinued operations income from discontinued operations increased by million from the prior year as a result of the sale of eight properties in chicago  il  five in dallas  tx  and one in allen  tx that we acquired in the prentiss acquisition 
we also sold five properties that were previously included in our same store portfolio 
these properties combined had net income of million and gain on sale of million during the year ended december  before minority interest 
included in the gain on sale amount was million attributable to minority interest in the chicago property that was sold by one of our consolidated real estate ventures 
net income net income declined by million in the year ended december   compared to the same period in as increased revenues in were offset by increases in operating expenses primarily depreciation and amortization and financing costs 
all major financial statement captions increased as a result of our acquisition of prentiss and the related financing required to complete the transaction 
a significant element of these increases relate to additional depreciation and amortization charges from the significant property additions including both the trc acquisition in and the prentiss acquisition and 
table of contents the values ascribed to related acquired intangibles eg  in place leases 
these charges do not affect our ability to pay dividends and may not be comparable to those of other real estate companies that have not made such acquisitions 
such charges can be expected to continue until the values ascribed to the lease intangibles are fully amortized 
these intangibles are amortizing over the related lease terms or estimated tenant relationship 
in addition  a significant portion of the decrease in net income is attributable to the million in depreciation expense described in the depreciation and amortization expense section above 
earnings per common share earnings per common share of for the year ended december  as compared to earnings per common share of in declined as a result of the factors described in net income above and an increase in the average number of common shares outstanding 
we issued million common shares in our acquisition of prentiss

table of contents revenue revenue increased by million primarily due to properties that were acquired in and a full year of operations of those properties acquired in  primarily the trc properties acquired in september revenue for same store properties increased by million due to increased tenant reimbursement revenue resulting from increased property operating expenses in as compared to other revenue represents lease termination fees  bankruptcy settlement proceeds  leasing commissions and third party management fees 
total portfolio other revenue increased by million in primarily due to an increase in net termination fees associated with tenant terminations in offset by the settlement of a previously disclosed litigation in million plus accrued interest on our security deposit that was released 
operating expenses and real estate taxes property operating expenses increased by million in primarily due to properties acquired in and a full year of operations of properties acquired in as well as increased repairs and maintenance costs  snow removal costs  electric expense  security expense  janitorial costs and hvac maintenance expense at existing properties in our same store property portfolio and our development properties 
real estate taxes increased by million primarily due to properties acquired in and a full year of real estate taxes for our properties acquired in as well as increased real estate tax assessments in at existing properties in our same store property portfolio and our development properties as a result of higher tax rates and property assessments 
interest expense interest expense increased by million in primarily due to i an increase in average debt as a result of debt incurred to finance our acquisitions in and our increased development activity and ii an increase in average rates on debt outstanding as a result of the increase in libor rates on our credit facilities 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in the amount of interest capitalized which is primarily attributable to our development of cira centre 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased by million in primarily due to properties acquired in  a full year of depreciation and amortization of properties acquired during and additional amortization from tenant improvements and leasing commissions paid during depreciation and amortization expense for the same store properties increased by million primarily as a result of the write off of tenant improvements and intangibles for spaces that were vacated during administrative expenses administrative expenses increased by million in primarily due to increased payroll and related costs associated with employees that we hired as part of our trc acquisition in september  higher compensation and benefits costs for employees and increased spending on process and technology improvements 
equity in income of real estate ventures equity in income of real estate ventures increased by million in as a result of increased net income from the real estate ventures 
the increased net income resulted from the sale of condominium units by one of the real estate venture in 
table of contents net gains on sales of interests in real estate during  we sold three parcels of land  realizing net gains totaling million 
the increase from the prior year of million is a result of the value of the land parcels sold in each year compared to their carrying values at the time of sale 
minority interest minority interest from continuing operations represents the equity in income attributable to the portion of the operating partnership and the consolidated real estate ventures not owned by us 
minority interest from continuing operations decreased by million in primarily due to decreased net income from our operating partnership and a decrease in the minority interest ownership percentage 
discontinued operations discontinued operations decreased by million in primarily due to the timing of property sales for assets included in discontinued operations in as compared to net income net income declined in by million as increased revenues were not sufficient to offset increases in operating and financing costs 
all major financial statement captions increased as a result of the company s significant property acquisitions in fiscal and and the related financing required to complete those transactions 
it should be noted that a significant element of these costs relate to additional depreciation and amortization charges relating to the significant property additions and the values ascribed to related acquired intangibles eg  in place leases 
these charges do not affect the company s ability to pay dividends and may not be comparable to those of other real estate companies that have not made such acquisitions 
such charges can be expected to continue until the values ascribed to the lease intangibles are fully amortized 
these intangibles are amortizing over the related lease terms or estimated tenant relationship 
the size of these non cash charges are expected to increase in the future as a result of the prentiss transaction 
earnings per common share earnings per common share of in as compared to earnings per common share of in as a result of the factors described in net income above and an increase in the average number of shares outstanding as a result of offerings completed in liquidity and capital resources general our principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months are as follows fund normal recurring expenses  meet debt service requirements  fund capital expenditures  including capital and tenant improvements and leasing costs  fund current development and redevelopment costs  and fund distributions declared by our board of trustees 
we believe that our liquidity needs will be satisfied through cash flows generated by operations and financing activities 
rental revenue  expense recoveries from tenants  and other income from operations are our principal sources of cash that we use to pay operating expenses  debt service  recurring capital expenditures and the minimum distributions required to maintain our reit qualification 
our revenue also 
table of contents includes third party fees generated by our property management  leasing  development and construction businesses 
we believe our revenue  together with proceeds from equity and debt financings  will continue to provide funds for our short term liquidity needs 
however  material changes in our operating or financing activities may adversely affect our net cash flows 
such changes  in turn  would adversely affect our ability to fund distributions  debt service payments and tenant improvements 
in addition  a material adverse change in our cash provided by operations would affect our compliance with covenants under our unsecured credit facility and unsecured notes 
our principal liquidity needs for periods beyond twelve months are for costs of developments  redevelopments  property acquisitions  scheduled debt maturities  major renovations  expansions and other non recurring capital improvements 
we draw on multiple financing sources to fund our long term capital needs 
we use our credit facility for general business purposes  including the acquisition  development and redevelopment of properties and the repayment of other debt 
as a result of our acquisition of prentiss  we have additional short and long term liquidity requirements 
historically  we have satisfied these requirements principally through the most advantageous source of capital at that time  including public offerings of unsecured debt and private placements of secured and unsecured debt  sales of common and preferred equity  capital raised through the disposition of assets  and joint venture transactions 
we believe these sources of capital will continue to be available to fund our capital needs 
we funded the approximately billion cash portion of the prentiss merger consideration  related transaction costs and prepayments of approximately million in prentiss mortgage debt at the closing of the merger through i a million unsecured term loan that we repaid in march  ii approximately million of cash from prudential s acquisition of prentiss properties  and iii approximately million through our revolving credit facility 
our ability to incur additional debt is dependent upon a number of factors  including our credit ratings  the value of our unencumbered assets  our degree of leverage and borrowing restrictions imposed by our current lenders 
we currently have investment grade ratings for prospective unsecured debt offerings from three major rating agencies 
if a rating agency were to downgrade our credit rating  our access to capital in the unsecured debt market would be more limited and the interest rate under our existing credit facility would increase 
our ability to sell common and preferred shares is dependent on  among other things  general market conditions for reits  market perceptions about us and the current trading price of our shares 
we regularly analyze which source of capital is most advantageous to us at any particular point in time 
the equity markets may not be consistently available on terms that we consider attractive 
cash flows the following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the consolidated statement of cash flows included in our consolidated financial statements and is not meant to be an all inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented 
as of december  and  we maintained cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively 
this million increase was the result of the following changes in cash flow from our various activities 
table of contents activity operating investing financing net cash flows our principal source of cash flows is from the operation of our properties 
our increased cash flow from operating activities is primarily attributable our acquisition of prentiss 
the increase in our investing activities in over is primarily attributable to our acquisition of prentiss in january and other property and land acquisitions totaling  million 
in addition  we incurred approximately million of capital expenditures for the properties that we own 
these increases in investing activities are offset by the net proceeds of million received from the sale of eight properties in chicago and seven properties in texas that we acquired in our acquisition of prentiss and subsequently sold 
we received net proceeds of million from sales of properties and land in our same store portfolio 
we redeemed marketable securities of million that had been escrowed to secure a secured notes payable 
the increase in our financing activities in as compared to is primarily attributable to the issuance in of  million of unsecured notes resulting in net proceeds of  million 
the proceeds were used to repay the million term loan that we obtained in connection with our acquisition of prentiss  as well as to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings on our credit facility 
this cash inflow is offset by our repurchase of common shares totaling million and our four distribution payments totaling million 
capitalization indebtedness as of december   we had approximately billion of outstanding indebtedness 
the table below summarizes our mortgage notes payable  our unsecured notes  and our revolving credit facility at december  and december dollars in thousands balance fixed rate variable rate total percent of total debt fixed rate variable rate total weighted average interest rate at period end fixed rate variable rate the variable rate debt shown above generally bears interest based on various spreads over libor the term of which we select 
the december  fixed rate balance includes million of variable rate debt that is effectively fixed at via an interest rate hedge 

table of contents unsecured credit facility we use credit facility borrowings for general business purposes  including the acquisition  development and redevelopment of properties and the repayment of other debt 
in december  we replaced our then existing unsecured credit facility with a million unsecured credit facility the credit facility that matures in december  subject to a one year extension option upon payment of a fee and the absence of any defaults 
borrowings under the new credit facility generally bear interest at libor libor was as of december  plus a spread over libor ranging from to based on our unsecured senior debt rating 
we have an option to increase the maximum borrowings under the credit facility to million subject to the absence of any defaults and our ability to obtain additional commitments from our existing or new lenders 
as of december   we had million of borrowings and million of letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility  leaving million of unused availability 
on january   we used million of borrowings under the credit facility to payoff the million unsecured floating rate notes due  notice of this payoff was given in november for the years ended december  and  our weighted average interest rates  including the effects of interest rate hedges discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included herein  and including both the new credit facility and prior credit facility  were and per annum  respectively 
the credit facility contains financial and non financial covenants  including covenants that relate to our incurrence of additional debt  the granting of liens  consummation of mergers and consolidations  the disposition of assets and interests in subsidiaries  the making of loans and investments  and the payment of dividends 
the restriction on dividends permits us to pay dividends in the amount required for us to retain our qualification as a reit and otherwise limits dividends to of our funds from operations 
the credit facility also contains financial covenants that require us to maintain an interest coverage ratio  a fixed charge coverage ratio  an unsecured debt ratio and an unencumbered cash flow ratio above certain specified minimum levels  to maintain net worth above an amount determined on a specified formula  and to maintain a leverage ratio and a secured debt ratio below certain maximum levels 
another financial covenant limits the ratio of unsecured debt to unencumbered properties 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants as of december  unsecured notes on march   the operating partnership consummated the public offering of  aggregate principal amount of its unsecured floating rate notes due   aggregate principal amount of its notes due and  aggregate principal amount of its notes due the company guaranteed the payment of principal and interest on these notes 
on october   we completed an offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible notes due in an offering made in reliance upon an exemption from registration rights under rule a under the securities act of and issued an additional million of exchangeable notes on october  to cover over allotments 
at certain times and upon the occurrence of certain events  the notes are convertible into cash up to their principal amount and  with respect to the remainder  if any  of the conversion value in excess of such principal amount  cash or shares of the company s common stock 
the initial conversion rate will be shares per  principal amount of notes which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of per share 
the notes may not be redeemed by us prior to october  except to preserve the company s status as a reit for u

guaranties 
as of december   we had guaranteed repayment of approximately million of loans on behalf of certain real estate ventures 
see item properties real estate ventures 
we also provide customary environmental indemnities and completion guarantees in connection with construction and permanent financing both for our own account and on behalf of real estate ventures 

table of contents share repurchases we maintain a share repurchase program under which our board has authorized us to repurchase our common shares from time to time 
our board initially authorized this program in and has periodically replenished capacity under the program  including  most recently  on may  when our board restored capacity to million common shares 
during the year ended december   we repurchased approximately million common shares under this program at an average price of per share  leaving approximately million in remaining capacity 
our board has not limited the duration of the program 
on october  we repurchased  common shares with a portion of the proceeds of our exchangeable guaranteed notes at an average purchase price of per share approximately million in aggregate 
we repurchased these shares under a separate board authorization that provided that the shares repurchased did not reduce capacity under the share repurchase program 
off balance sheet arrangements we are not dependent on any off balance sheet financing arrangements for liquidity 
our off balance sheet arrangements are discussed in note to the financial statements  investment in unconsolidated real estate ventures 
additional information about the debt of our unconsolidated real estate ventures is included in item properties 
our interest rate incurred under our revolving credit facility is subject to modification depending on our rating status with qualified agencies 
shelf registration statement we maintain a shelf registration statement for the issuance of common shares  preferred shares  depositary shares and warrants and unsecured debt securities 
subject to our ongoing compliance with securities laws  and if warranted by market conditions  we may offer and sell equity and debt securities from time to time under the registration statement 
short and long term liquidity we believe that our cash flow from operations is adequate to fund our short term liquidity requirements 
cash flow from operations is generated primarily from rental revenues and operating expense reimbursements from tenants and management services income from providing services to third parties 
we intends to use these funds to meet short term liquidity needs  which are to fund operating expenses  debt service requirements  recurring capital expenditures  tenant allowances  leasing commissions and the minimum distributions required to maintain the company s reit qualification under the internal revenue code 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements  such as for property acquisitions  development  investments in real estate ventures  scheduled debt maturities  major renovations  expansions and other significant capital improvements  through cash from operations  borrowings under our credit facility  other long term secured and unsecured indebtedness  the issuance of equity securities and the proceeds from the disposition of selected assets 
inflation a majority of our leases provide for reimbursement of real estate taxes and operating expenses either on a triple net basis or over a base amount 
in addition  many of our office leases provide for fixed base rent increases 
we believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be partially offset by expense reimbursement and contractual rent increases

c future minimum rental payments under the terms of all non cancelable ground leases under which we are the lessee are expensed on a straight line basis regardless of when payments are due 
as part of our acquisition of the trc properties in september  we agreed to issue to the sellers up to a maximum of million of class a units of the operating partnership if certain of the acquired properties achieve at least occupancy prior to september  the maximum number of units that we are obligated to issue declines monthly and  as of december   the maximum balance payable under this arrangement was million  with no amount currently due 
as part of the trc acquisition  we acquired our interest in two logan square  a  square foot office building in philadelphia  primarily through a second and third mortgage secured by this property 
we currently do not expect to take title to two logan square until  at the earliest  september in the event that we take title to two logan square upon a foreclosure of our mortgage  we have agreed to make a payment to an unaffiliated third party with a residual interest in the fee owner of this property 
the amount of the payment would be million if we must pay a state and local transfer tax upon taking title  and million if no transfer tax is payable upon the transfer 
as part of the trc acquisition and several of our other acquisitions  we agreed not to sell the acquired properties 
in the case of the trc properties  we agreed not to sell the acquired properties for periods ranging from three to years from the acquisition date as follows king of prussia road  east lancaster avenue and delaware avenue three years  one rodney square and radnor financial center years  and one logan square  two logan square and radnor corporate center years 
at december   we had agreed not to sell properties that aggregate million square feet for periods that expire through our agreements generally provide that we may dispose of the subject properties only in transactions that qualify as tax free exchanges under section of the internal revenue code or in other tax deferred transactions 
in the event that we sell any of the properties within the applicable restricted period in non exempt transactions  we would be required to pay significant tax liabilities that would be incurred by the parties who sold us the applicable property 
we invest in our properties and regularly incur capital expenditures in the ordinary course to maintain the properties 
we believe that such expenditures enhance our competitiveness 
we also enter into construction  utility and service contracts in the ordinary course of business which may extend beyond one year 
these contracts typically provide for cancellation with insignificant or no cancellation penalties 

table of contents interest rate risk and sensitivity analysis the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates 
the range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one year period 
market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates chosen 
our financial instruments consist of both fixed and variable rate debt 
as of december   our consolidated debt consisted of million including million of variable interest rate debt that is fixed through interest rate swaps in fixed rate mortgages and million in variable rate mortgage notes  million borrowings under our credit facility and billion in unsecured notes net of discounts of which billion are fixed rate borrowings and million are variable rate borrowings 
all financial instruments were entered into for other than trading purposes and the net market value of these financial instruments is referred to as the net financial position 
changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variable rate portions of our debt portfolio 
a change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position  but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows 
a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows  but does not impact the net financial instrument position 
if market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increase by  the increase in annual interest expense on our variable rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately million 
if market rates of interest on our variable rate debt decrease by  the decrease in interest expense on our variable rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately million 
if market rates of interest increase by  the fair value of our outstanding fixed rate debt would decrease by approximately million 
if market rates of interest decrease by  the fair value of our outstanding fixed rate mortgage debt would increase by approximately million 
as of december   based on prevailing interest rates and credit spreads  the fair value of our unsecured notes was billion
