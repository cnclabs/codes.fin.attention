overview we are primarily engaged in the production  grading  packing  and sale of fresh shell eggs 
our fiscal year end is the saturday nearest to may which was june  weeks  june  weeks  and may  weeks for the most recent three fiscal years 
our operations are fully integrated 
at our facilities we hatch chicks  grow pullets  manufacture feed  and produce  process  and distribute shell eggs 
we currently are the largest producer and distributor of fresh shell eggs in the united states 
shell eggs accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal and in fiscal egg products accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal and in fiscal we primarily market our shell eggs in the southwestern  southeastern  mid western and mid atlantic regions of the united states 
shell eggs are sold directly by us primarily to national and regional supermarket chains 
we currently use contract producers for approximately of our total egg production 
contract producers operate under agreements with us for the use of their facilities in the production of shell eggs by layers owned by us 
we also own the eggs produced 
also  shell eggs are purchased  as needed  for resale by us from outside producers 
our operating income or loss is significantly affected by wholesale shell egg market prices  which can fluctuate widely and are outside of our control 
retail sales of shell eggs are greatest during the fall and winter months and lowest during the summer months 
prices for shell eggs fluctuate in response to seasonal factors and a natural increase in egg production during the spring and early summer 
our cost of production is materially affected by feed costs  which average about of our total farm egg production cost 
changes in feed costs result in changes in our cost of goods sold 
the cost of feed ingredients is affected by a number of supply and demand factors such as crop production and weather  and other factors  such as the level of grain exports  over which we have little or no control 
the purchase of hillandale  llc  aep and hillandale farms  llc described above in part  item  is collectively referred to below as the hillandale purchase

our operating results are significantly affected by wholesale shell egg market prices  which are outside of our control 
small changes in production or demand levels can have a large effect on shell egg prices 
during fiscal  consumer demand increased  partially due to the popularity of high protein diets 
egg producers increased egg supply to meet consumer demand 
during our second fiscal quarter  consumer demand decreased to normal levels 
at the same time  egg supply continued at the higher levels and resulted in a drop in egg selling prices for the remainder of fiscal during fiscal  consumer demand improved slightly  but egg supply continued at higher levels

selling  general and administrative expenses include costs of marketing  distribution  accounting and corporate overhead 
selling  general and administrative expense was million in fiscal  an increase of million as compared to million for fiscal the increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to an increase of million in franchise fees for specialty egg sales  and an increase of million in our equity compensation plan expense  with an overall decrease in delivery costs

net income 
as a result of the above  net loss for fiscal was million  or per basic and diluted share  compared to net loss of million  or per basic and diluted share  for fiscal capital resources and liquidity 
our working capital at june  was million compared to million at june  our current ratio was at june  as compared with at june  our need for working capital generally is highest in the first and second fiscal quarters ending in august and november 
during the first quarter shell egg prices are normally at seasonal lows 
in the second quarter  we usually build inventory balances in anticipation of the holiday season 
seasonal borrowing needs frequently are higher during these periods than during other fiscal periods 
we have a million line of credit with three banks  million of which was utilized as a standby letter of credit at june  our long term debt at that date  including current maturities  totaled million  as compared to million at june  for the fiscal year ended june   million in net cash was provided by operating activities 
this compares to million of net cash provided for the fiscal year ended june  in fiscal  million was used for acquisition of businesses  was used for purchases of property  plant and equipment 
net cash of million was used for investments and  received on notes receivable 
in fiscal  we received  from the disposal of property  plant and equipment 
as part of our stock option plan  approximately  was received for sales of common stock from the treasury  and million was used for payments of dividends on our common stock 
proceeds from long term borrowings of million were received and payments of million were made on long term debt 
in accord with the hillandale  llc purchase agreement  we made a payment of million on our long term purchase obligation 
the net result was an increase in cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
for the fiscal year ended june   million in net cash was provided by operating activities 
this compares to million of net cash provided for fiscal year ended may  in fiscal  million was used for acquisitions of businesses  million was used for purchases of property  plant and equipment  and million was received from sales of property  plant and equipment 
net cash of million was provided by investments and  received on notes receivable 
as part of our stock option plan  approximately  was received for sales of common stock from the treasury  and million was used for payments of dividends on our common stock 
proceeds from long term borrowings of million were received in additional long term debt and payments of million were made on long term debt 
the net result was a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
substantially all trade receivables and inventories collateralize our revolving line of credit and property  plant and equipment collateralize our long term debt under our loan agreements with our lenders 
unless otherwise approved by our lenders  we are required by provisions of these loan agreements to maintain minimum levels of working capital ratio of not less than to and net worth minimum of million tangible net worth adjusted for earnings  limit dividends to an aggregate amount not to exceed  per quarter allowed if no default  capital expenditures less exclusions not to exceed of depreciation for the same four fiscal quarters  lease obligations and additional long term borrowings total funded debt to total capitalization not to exceed  and maintain various cash flow coverage ratios to  among other restrictions 
at june   we were in compliance with the provisions of all loan agreements 
under certain of the loan agreements  the lenders have the option to require the prepayment of any outstanding borrowings in the event we undergo a change in control 
under the terms of our agreement with hillandale and the hillandale shareholders  a new florida limited liability company named hillandale  llc was formed 
in fiscal  we purchased of the units of membership in hillandale  llc  with the remaining units to be acquired in essentially equal annual installments over a four year period 
the purchase price of the units is equal to their book value as calculated in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
in fiscal  we purchased  pursuant to the agreement  an additional of the units of membership for million from our cash balances 
we have recorded the obligation to acquire the remaining at its present value of million 
the actual remaining purchase price may be higher or lower when the hillandale purchase is completed 
future funding is expected to be provided by our cash balances and borrowings under our revolving credit agreement 
capital expenditure requirements are expected to be for the normal repair and replacement of our facilities 
in addition  we have plans to construct a new integrated layer production complex in west texas to replace our albuquerque  new mexico complex  which has ceased egg production 
the expected cost is approximately million 
looking forward  we believe that our current cash balances  borrowing capacity  utilization of our revolving line of credit  and cash flows from operations are sufficient to fund our current and projected capital needs 
we currently have a million deferred tax liability due to a subsidiary s change from a cash basis to an accrual basis taxpayer on may  the taxpayer relief act of provides that this liability is payable ratably over the years beginning in fiscal however  such taxes will be due in their entirety in the first fiscal year in which there is a change in ownership control so that we no longer qualify as a family farming corporation 
we are currently making annual payments of approximately  related to this liability 
however  while these current payments reduce cash balances  payment of the million deferred tax liability would not impact our consolidated statement of operations or stockholders equity  as these taxes have been accrued and are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe that our existing cash and investments  as well as our unused lines of credit  if needed  will satisfy our foreseeable working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no existing off balance sheet arrangements as defined under securities and exchange commission regulations 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes future estimated cash payments  in thousands  to be made under existing contractual obligations 
further information on debt obligations is contained in note  and on lease obligations in note  of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the table does not reflect the obligations incurred by us for the hillandale acquisition  the exact amounts of which are to be determined under the terms of the agreement 
at the closing of the hillandale transaction on october   we purchased of the units of membership in hillandale  llc 
in august  in accordance with the agreement  we purchased  for million  an additional of the units of hillandale  llc based on their book value as of july  our ownership of hillandale  llc currently is 
we will incur costs for our purchase of the remaining of the units of membership over the remaining three years  which will culminate with us having a equity interest in hillandale  llc 
our obligation to acquire the remaining of hillandale  llc is recorded at its present value of million as of june  of which million is included in current liabilities and million is included in other non current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
total over years long term debt operating leases total impact of recently issued accounting standards 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas statement no 
revised sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  restricted stock and performance based shares to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation costs are recognized for all share based payments granted after the adoption of sfas no 
r and for all awards granted to employees prior to the adoption date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the adoption date 
accordingly  no restatements were made to prior periods 
the company recognized stock based compensation expense of for equity awards and  for liability awards in fiscal prior to adoption of sfas no 
r  the company applied accounting principles board apb no 
in accounting for employee stock compensation plans and generally recognized no compensation expense for employee stock options 
under the provisions of apb no 
 the company recognized a liability for stock appreciation rights sars and tandem stock appreciation rights tsars collectively  rights based upon the intrinsic value of vested sars and tsars at each period end 
under sfas no 
r  the company is required to recognize a liability for vested sars and tsars based upon their fair value at each period end using a black scholes option pricing model and to record a cumulative effect adjustment for the change in method of accounting for such liability awards 
the cumulative effect resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
r was insignificant and is included in stock based compensation expense for the current fiscal year 
on july   the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 

interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements in accordance with statement and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
additionally  interpretation provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we are currently evaluating whether the adoption of interpretation will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued fasb statement no  fair value measurements fas 
fas establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value  sets out a framework for measuring fair value  and expands on required disclosures about fair value measurement 
fas is effective for us on june  and will be applied prospectively 
the provisions of fas are not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 establishing the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities  to permit all entities to choose to elect to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value 
sfas no 
applies to fiscal years beginning after november   with early adoption permitted for an entity that has also elected to apply the provisions of sfas no 
an entity is prohibited from retrospectively applying sfas no 
 unless it chooses early adoption 
management is currently evaluating the impact of sfas no 
on its consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting standards requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
management suggests that our summary of significant accounting policies  as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  be read in conjunction with this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we believe the critical accounting policies that most impact our consolidated financial statements are described below 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
in the normal course of business  we extend credit to our customers on a short term basis 
although credit risks associated with our customers are considered minimal  we routinely review our accounts receivable balances and make provisions for probable doubtful accounts 
in circumstances where management is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us eg bankruptcy filings  a specific reserve is recorded to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  generally for amounts more than days past due 
inventories 
inventories of eggs  feed  supplies and livestock are valued principally at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
if market prices for eggs and feed grains move substantially lower  we would record adjustments to write down the carrying values of eggs and feed inventories to fair market value 
the cost associated with flock inventories  consisting principally of chick purchases  feed  labor  contractor payments and overhead costs  are accumulated during the growing period of approximately weeks 
capitalized flock costs are then amortized over the productive lives of the flocks  generally one to two years 
flock mortality is charged to cost of sales as incurred 
high mortality from disease or extreme temperatures would result in abnormal adjustments to write down flock inventories 
management continually monitors each flock and attempts to take appropriate actions to minimize the risk of mortality loss 
long lived assets 
depreciable long lived assets are primarily comprised of buildings and improvements and machinery and equipment 
depreciation is provided by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives  which are to years for buildings and improvements and to years for machinery and equipment 
an increase or decrease in the estimated useful lives would result in changes to depreciation expense 
when property and equipment are retired  sold  or otherwise disposed of  the asset s carrying amount and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss in included in operations 
we continually reevaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets  for events or changes in circumstances  which indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges are less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long lived asset to the estimated fair value of the asset 
investment in affiliates 
we have invested in other companies engaged in the production  processing and distribution of shell eggs and egg products 
our ownership percentages in these companies range from less than to 
therefore  these investments are recorded using the cost or the equity method  and accordingly  not consolidated in our financial statements 
changes in the ownership percentages of these investments might alter the accounting methods currently used 
our investment in these companies amounted to million at june  the combined total assets and total liabilities of these companies were approximately million and million  respectively  at june  we are a guarantor of approximately million of long term debt of one of the affiliates 
goodwill 
at june   our goodwill balance represented of total assets and of stockholders equity 
goodwill relates to the fiscal acquisition of hudson brothers  inc  the fiscal acquisition of hillandale farms  llc  and the fiscal acquisition of green forest foods  llc 
we adopted  as of june   statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
under sfas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise  for impairment 
an impairment loss would be recorded if the recorded goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
we have only one operating segment  which is our sole reporting unit 
accordingly  goodwill is tested for impairment at the entity level 
significant adverse industry or economic changes  or other factors not anticipated could result in an impairment charge to reduce recorded goodwill 
income taxes 
we determine our effective tax rate by estimating our permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
we are periodically audited by taxing authorities 
any audit adjustments affecting permanent differences could have an impact on our effective tax rate 
forward looking statements 
the foregoing statements contain forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties and our actual experience may differ materially from that discussed above 
factors that may cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in factors affecting future performance below  as well as future events that have the effect of reducing our available cash balances  such as unanticipated operating losses or capital expenditures related to possible future acquisitions 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which reflect management s analysis only as the date hereof 
we assume no obligation to update forward looking statements 
factors affecting future performance 
our future operating results may be affected by various trends and factors which are beyond our control 
these include adverse changes in shell egg prices and in the grain markets 
accordingly  past trends should not be used to anticipate future results and trends 
further  our prior performance should not be presumed to be an accurate indication of future performance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
we maintain certain of our debt as fixed rate in nature to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate changes 
a adverse move decrease in interest rates would adversely affect the net fair value of our debt by million at june  we are a party to no other market risk sensitive instruments requiring disclosure
