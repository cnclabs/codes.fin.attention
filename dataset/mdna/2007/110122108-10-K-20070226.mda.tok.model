plavix the company s largest product ranked by net sales is plavix clopidogrel bisulfate with us sales of billion in  billion in and billion in the composition of matter patent for plavix  which expires in  is currently the subject of patent litigation in the us with apotex inc and apotex corp 
apotex and with other generic companies  as well as in other less significant jurisdictions 
the company has previously disclosed certain developments in the pending plavix litigation with apotex  including the at risk launch of a generic product by apotex in august as noted above  apotex launched a generic clopidogrel bisulfate product that competes with plavix on august  on august   the us district court for the southern district of new york the court granted a motion by the company and its product partner  sanofi aventis sanofi  to enjoin further sales of apotex s generic clopidogrel bisulfate product  but did not order apotex to recall product from its customers 
the court s grant of a preliminary injunction has been affirmed on appeal 
the trial in the underlying patent litigation ended on february  and the court is expected to rule following post trial briefing 
the at risk launch of generic clopidogrel bisulfate had a significant adverse effect on net sales of plavix in  which the company estimates to be in a range of billion to billion 
in particular  the launch had a significant adverse effect on sales in the third quarter  which the company estimates to be in the range of million to million  as well as in the fourth quarter of  which the company estimates to be in the range of million to million 
in the first  second  third and fourth quarters of  us net sales for plavix were million  million  million and million  respectively 
estimated total us prescription demand for clopidogrel bisulfate branded and generic increased by in compared to  while estimated total us prescription demand for branded plavix decreased by in the same period 
the company expects generic clopidogrel bisulfate that was sold into distribution channels following the apotex at risk launch in august will have a residual impact on plavix net sales and the company s overall financial results into the full impact of apotex s launch of its generic clopidogrel bisulfate product on the company cannot be reasonably estimated at this time and will depend on a number of factors  including  among others  the amount of generic product sold by apotex  whether the company and sanofi the companies prevail in the underlying patent litigation  even if the companies prevail in the pending patent case  the extent to which the launch by apotex will permanently adversely impact the pricing and prescription demand for plavix  the amount of damages that would be sought and or recovered by the companies  and apotex s ability to pay such damages 
loss of market exclusivity of plavix and or sustained generic competition would be material to the company s sales of plavix  results of operations and cash flows  and could be material to the company s financial condition and liquidity 
the company s us territory partnership under its alliance with sanofi is also a plaintiff in three additional pending patent infringement lawsuits against dr 
reddy s laboratories  inc and dr 
reddy s laboratories  ltd dr 
reddy s  teva pharmaceuticals usa  inc teva and cobalt pharmaceuticals inc cobalt  all related to the us patent no 
 the patent 
a trial date for the action against dr 
reddy s has not been set 
the patent infringement actions against teva and cobalt have been stayed pending resolution of the apotex litigation  and the parties to those actions have agreed to be bound by the outcome of the litigation against apotex  although teva and cobalt can appeal the outcome of the litigation 
each of dr 
reddy s and teva have filed an abbreviated new drug application anda with the us food and drug administration fda  and all exclusivity periods and statutory stay periods under the hatch waxman act have expired  with the exception of the month stay that applies to teva  which expires on february  accordingly  final approval by the fda would provide each company authorization to distribute a generic clopidogrel bisulfate product in the us  subject to various legal remedies for which the companies may apply including injunctive relief and damages 
the company continues to believe that the plavix patents are valid and infringed  and with sanofi  is vigorously pursuing enforcement of their patent rights in plavix 
it is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the ultimate outcome of the ongoing patent litigation with apotex  or of the other plavix patent litigations  or the timing of any renewed generic competition for plavix from apotex or additional generic competition for plavix from other third party generic pharmaceutical companies 
however  if apotex were to prevail at trial  the company would expect to face renewed generic competition for plavix from apotex promptly thereafter

the company is cooperating fully with the investigation 
it is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the outcome of the investigation or its impact on the company 
it is also not possible at this time reasonably to assess the impact of the investigation  if any  on the company s compliance with the deferred prosecution agreement dpa with the us attorney s office for the district of new jersey usao 
also as previously disclosed  the usao had initiated an investigation conducted by the monitor under the dpa monitor and the usao  into corporate governance issues relating to the company s negotiations of the proposed settlement with apotex  which included a review of whether there was any violation of federal securities laws in connection with the proposed settlement with apotex under the terms of the previously disclosed consent order the company entered into with the us securities and exchange commission in august consent or sec consent
