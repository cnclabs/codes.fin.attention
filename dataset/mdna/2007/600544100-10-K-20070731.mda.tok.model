executive overview we use problem solving design and innovation to enhance the performance of human habitats worldwide  making our customers lives more productive  rewarding  delightful  and meaningful 
we do this by providing high quality products and related knowledge services 
at present  most of our customers come to us for work environments 
our primary products include furniture systems  seating  storage and material handling solutions  freestanding furniture  and casegoods 
our services extend from workplace and real estate strategy to furniture asset management 
we recently launched two new ventures aimed at extending the herman miller brand into new market opportunities 
the first of these is convia tm  a business which provides programmable electrical and data infrastructure for building interiors 
we also introduced the be collection tm  a suite of new products intended to further our reach into the work accessories market 
our primary domestic manufacturing operations are located in michigan and georgia 
we also have a significant manufacturing presence in the united kingdom  our largest marketplace outside the united states 
in fiscal year  we opened a new manufacturing operation in china 
our products are sold internationally through wholly owned subsidiaries or branches in various countries including canada  france  germany  italy  japan  mexico  australia  singapore  china  india  and the netherlands 
our products are offered elsewhere in the world primarily through independent dealerships 
we manufacture our products using a system of lean manufacturing techniques collectively referred to as the herman miller production system hmps 
we strive to maintain efficiencies and cost savings by minimizing the amount of inventory on hand 
accordingly  production is order driven with direct materials and components purchased as needed to meet demand 
the standard lead time for the majority of our products is to days 
as a result  the rate of our inventory turns is high 
these combined factors could cause our inventory levels to appear relatively low in relation to sales volume 
a key element of our manufacturing strategy is to limit fixed production costs by sourcing component parts from strategic suppliers 
this strategy has allowed us to increase the variable nature of our cost structure while retaining proprietary control over those production processes that we believe provide us a competitive advantage 
as a result of this strategy  our manufacturing operations are largely assembly based 
our business comprises various operating segments as defined by generally accepted accounting principles 
these operating segments are determined on the basis of how we internally report and evaluate financial information used to make operating decisions and are organized by the various markets we serve 
for external reporting purposes  we aggregate these operating segments as follows 
north american furniture solutions includes the business associated with the design  manufacture  and sale of furniture products for office and healthcare environments throughout the united states  canada  and mexico 
non north american furniture solutions includes the business associated with the design  manufacture  and sale of furniture products primarily for work related settings outside north america 
other includes our north american residential furniture business as well as other business activities such as convia and startup businesses associated with the herman miller creative office and unallocated corporate expenses 
core strengths we rely on the following core strengths in delivering workplace solutions to our customers 
problem solving design and innovation we are committed to developing aesthetically and functionally innovative new products and have a history of doing so 
we believe our skills and experience in matching problem solving design with the workplace needs of our customers provide us with a competitive advantage in the marketplace 
an important component of our business strategy is to actively pursue a program of new product research  design  and development 
we accomplish this through the use of an internal research and design staff as well as external design resources generally compensated on a royalty basis 
operational excellence we were among the first in our industry to embrace the concepts of lean manufacturing 
hmps provides the foundation for all of our manufacturing operations 
we are committed to continuously improving both product quality and production and operational efficiency 
building and leading networks we value relationships in all areas of our business 
we consider our networks of innovative designers  owned and independent dealers  and suppliers to be among the most important competitive factors vital to the long term success of our business 
channels of distribution our products and services are offered to most of our customers under standard trade credit terms between and days and are sold through the following distribution channels 
independent contract furniture dealers and licensees most of our product sales are made to a network of independently owned and operated contract furniture dealerships doing business in many countries around the world 
these dealers purchase our products and distribute them to end customers 
we recognize revenue on product sales through this channel once our products are shipped and title passes to the dealer 
many of these dealers also offer furniture related services  including product installation 
owned contract furniture dealers at june   we owned contract furniture dealerships  some of which have operations in multiple locations 
the financial results of these owned dealers are included in our consolidated financial statements 
product sales to these dealerships are eliminated as inter company transactions from our consolidated financial results 
we recognize revenue on these sales once products are shipped to the end customer and installation is substantially complete 
we believe independent ownership of contract furniture dealers is generally  the best model for a financially strong distribution network 
with this in mind  our strategy is to continue to pursue opportunities to transition our owned dealerships to independent owners 
where possible  our goal is to involve local managers in these ownership transitions 
direct customer sales we sometimes sell products and services directly to end customers without an intermediary eg sales to the us federal government 
in most of these instances  we contract separately with a dealership or third party installation company to provide sales related services 
we recognize revenue on these sales once products are shipped and installation is substantially complete 
independent retailers certain products are sold to end customers through independent retail operations 
revenue is recognized on these sales once products are shipped and title passes to the independent retailer 
challenges ahead like all businesses  we are faced with a host of challenges and risks 
we believe our core strengths and values  which provide the foundation for our strategic direction  have us well prepared to respond to the inevitable challenges we will face in the future 
while we are confident in our direction  we acknowledge the risks specific to our business and industry 
refer to item a of our annual report on form k for discussion of certain of these risk factors 
future avenues of growth we believe we are well positioned to successfully pursue our mission despite the risks and challenges we face 
that is  we believe we can continue to improve the performance of human habitats worldwide 
in pursuing our mission  we have identified the following as key avenues for our future growth 
primary markets capturing additional market share within our existing primary markets by offering superior solutions to customers who value space as a strategic tool adjacent markets further applying our core skills in environments such as healthcare  higher education  and residential developing economies expanding our geographic reach in areas of the world with significant growth potential new markets developing new products and technologies that serve new markets industry analysis the business and institutional furniture manufacturer s association bifma is the trade association for the us domestic office furniture industry 
we closely monitor the trade statistics reported by bifma and consider them among the key indicators of industry wide sales and order performance 
we also analyze bifma statistical information over several quarters as a benchmark comparison against the performance of our domestic us business 
finally  bifma regularly provides its members with industry forecast information  which we use internally as one of many considerations in our short and long range planning process 
discussion of business conditions our fiscal year ended june  included weeks of operations 
by comparison  the year ended june  included weeks of operations  the extra week was required to bring our fiscal reporting dates in line with the actual calendar months 
we report an additional week of operations in our fiscal calendar approximately every six years for this reason 
the fiscal year ended may  included a standard weeks of operations 
fiscal marked our third consecutive year of double digit sales and net earnings growth 
during the year we made continued progress toward many of our long term strategic goals 
while sales growth was seen across virtually all areas of our business in fiscal  our non north american furniture solutions segment once again outpaced our business in north america 
our business outside north america has continued to become a larger proportion of our consolidated net sales  a fact we believe makes us a stronger  more deeply diversified company 
this international growth has been driven by the expansion of our distribution footprint and investments in new products 
in february of this year we opened a new manufacturing plant in china 
this operation  combined with our fast growing network of independent dealers in the region  will serve customers within china and throughout asia 
our strategic progress in fiscal was not limited to international sales growth 
market acceptance of our most recent systems product introductions  my studio environments tm and vivo tm interiors  has exceeded our expectations  although we did incur higher than expected start up costs related to these products 
our pursuit of new market opportunities led us to introduce the be collection  a suite of work accessories aimed at offering users more personalization and control within their work environments 
we also launched convia  a new building infrastructure technology which we believe offers significant potential for growth in an entirely new market 
direct material cost increases remained a challenge during much of fiscal while in some cases  these costs moderated during the second half of the year  particularly in the case of steel components  for the most part they remained above the levels in fiscal in response to these higher costs  we implemented a general price increase effective in february the price adjustment varied by product line and increased our commercial product list prices an average of percent 
this price change followed similar increases in each of the past two fiscal years  each of which averaged approximately percent of list price 
we have been successful in capturing a portion of general price increases in recent years 
however  we expect the intense price competition in our industry to continue 
accordingly  our past success in capturing benefit from our price changes is not necessarily indicative of our ability to do so in the future 
the general economic environment for our industry was positive throughout most of fiscal  with office furniture consumption being bolstered by strong corporate profits  service sector employment  and non residential construction rates 
the outlook for the industry  however  looks somewhat mixed given current economic conditions 
in its may domestic industry forecast  bifma noted that these key economic indicators are expected to moderate in the near term 
the forecast  which extends through calendar year  indicates an expectation that industry sales and orders will continue to grow  though at a slower pace than in recent years 
financial results the following is a comparison of our annual results of operations and year over year percentage changes for the periods indicated 
in millions fiscal chg from fiscal chg from fiscal net sales    cost of sales    gross margin operating expenses operating earnings net other expenses earnings before income taxes income tax expense minority interest  net of tax na net earnings net sales  orders  and backlog fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales of  million in fiscal year increased million from the prior year 
this increase of percent was driven by growth within both of our primary reportable business segments 
the additional week in fiscal added approximately million in net sales to that period 
excluding the impact of this additional week  the year over year growth in net sales between fiscal years and totaled approximately percent 
despite intense price competition in all of our major market areas  we were able to capture some benefit in the current year from our recent price increases 
we estimate between million to million of our fiscal sales growth is attributable to these pricing actions 
the most recent of these general price increases became effective in february and we didn t begin to feel its positive impact on net sales until late in the fiscal year 
consolidated net trade orders in fiscal totaled  million 
this compares to orders of  million in fiscal and represents year over year growth of percent 
excluding the extra week of operations in the prior year  order growth was percent between periods 
average weekly order pacing was higher in the first half of fiscal than in the second half of the year 
this trend reflects moderating demand in the north american contract furniture market  combined with the seasonality we typically experience in our order patterns 
the seasonality is largely driven by the timing of the federal government fiscal year and the december holiday season 
the backlog of unfilled orders at the end of fiscal totaled million  an increase of percent from the prior year of million 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we completed the sale of two wholly owned contract furniture dealerships one based in new york city  new york  and another in cleveland  ohio 
another development in the first quarter of fiscal involved an independently owned dealership we had previously consolidated as a variable interest entity vie under financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin r 
due to this dealership s improved financial condition  the owners were successful in obtaining outside bank financing 
as a result  we were no longer required to include this vie in our consolidated financial statements 
these dealership transitions affect our year over year comparisons 
net sales and trade orders from these dealers included in our fiscal financial results totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
the financial results of these dealerships were not included in our consolidated financial statements during fiscal bifma reported an estimated year over year increase in us office furniture shipments of approximately percent and orders of percent for the twelve month period ended may by comparison  net sales and order growth for our domestic us business totaled approximately percent and percent  respectively 
it is important to note that these growth percentages  both for our domestic us business as well as the bifma amounts  include the impact of our extra week of operations in fiscal taking this factor into consideration and the fact that dealer sales and orders were higher than because of vies included in as described above  we believe our net sales and order performance in fiscal indicates that we have been successful in capturing domestic us market share 
while the sales and order data for our us operations provide a relative comparison to bifma  it is not intended to be an exact comparison 
the actual data we report to bifma is done so in a manner consistent with the bifma definition of office furniture consumption 
this definition differs slightly from the categorization we have presented in this report 
notwithstanding this difference  we believe our presentation provides the reader with a more relevant comparison 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales of  million in fiscal were percent higher than our fiscal level 
excluding the impact of the extra week of operations in fiscal  the year over year growth in net sales totaled approximately percent 
similar to our performance in the most recent year fiscal  sales growth in fiscal varied across the majority of the markets we serve 
year over year increases in the level of price discounting occurred throughout fiscal  however  this market pricing pressure was more than offset by benefits from our previously instituted general price increases 
our best estimate is that we were able to capture approximately to percent of the price increases  net of discounting  in both fiscal years and trade orders in fiscal increased percent over the fiscal level of  million 
excluding the extra week of operations  order growth between fiscal and was percent 
the backlog of unfilled orders at the end of fiscal was million 
this was an increase of percent from the fiscal ending level of million 
the dealership transitions discussed above also affect the comparison of our fiscal and fiscal results 
net sales from these dealers included in our fiscal results totaled approximately million and net trade orders in that year were approximately million 
the ending backlog for fiscal included approximately million related to these dealers 
discussion of business segments fiscal compared to fiscal net sales within our north american furniture solutions segment increased percent from  million in fiscal to  million in the current year 
on a weekly average basis which adjusts for the extra week of operations in fiscal net sales in this segment were percent higher than the prior year level 
to varying degrees  this growth was experienced throughout the majority of our north american business operations 
of particular note is our business within the healthcare industry  which has continued to drive significant year over year percentage increases 
this remains a key growth area within the segment  and we feel it presents a tremendous opportunity to capitalize on the boom in new construction within the healthcare industry 
sales at our mexican subsidiary again reached double digit growth over the prior year 
canadian sales  which increased over the prior year level during the first half of fiscal  ended the full year approximately flat with operating earnings in fiscal were million  or percent of net sales 
this compares to million or percent in the prior year 
the most significant net sales increases within our consolidated business operations came  once again  from our non north american furniture solutions segment 
we had year over year increases in net sales across all geographic regions except south america 
total net sales in the year of million were up percent from million in fiscal year on a weekly average basis  net sales in fiscal were percent higher than the prior year 
the non north american furniture solutions segment generated percent of our consolidated net sales in fiscal  compared to percent in fiscal our operations in the united kingdom  the segment s largest contributor to net sales and operating earnings  generated sales growth of percent from the prior year 
we also saw continued sales growth in continental europe and are beginning to experience more activity in eastern europe as we expand our dealer network 
our results in the asia pacific region were particularly strong in fiscal  with net sales increasing percent from the prior year 
as do many in our industry  we see a compelling business opportunity for further growth in asia 
we are extremely pleased with the progress we made this year in executing our asian business strategy  including the startup of our new chinese manufacturing facility  and the expansion of our independent dealer network in china and japan 
operating earnings in fiscal within our non north american segment totaled million  or percent of net sales 
this compares to million or percent last year 
net sales within the other segment category were million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
the increase was driven by the growth of our north american home business 
sales in fiscal included net sales of million from a vie we had previously consolidated under the accounting provisions of fin r 
changes in currency exchange rates from the prior year affected the us dollar value of net sales within both primary operating segments 
we estimate these changes effectively increased our fiscal net sales within the north american furniture solutions segment by approximately million 
this was largely driven by the general weakening in the average us dollar canadian dollar exchange rate during the current year 
as for our non north american furniture solutions segment  exchange rate changes increased fiscal net sales by approximately million 
this increase was driven by favorable movements in the us dollar british pound sterling and us dollar euro exchange rates as compared to last year 
it is important to note that period to period changes in currency exchange rates have a directionally similar impact on our international cost structures 
operating earnings within our non north american business segment increased an estimated million in fiscal due to changes in currency exchange rates relative to the prior year level 
the estimated impact on operating earnings of our north american business segment was not significant in the current year 
discussion of business segments fiscal compared to fiscal business in our north american furniture solutions segment remained strong throughout fiscal net sales for this segment totaled  million  compared to  million in fiscal this represents a percent increase in net sales 
on a weekly average basis adjusting for the extra week of operations in fiscal net sales in fiscal were percent higher than the prior year 
we experienced varying degrees of growth across the entire segment  with the largest gains coming from our core office environment and healthcare businesses 
we posted net sales in our non north american furniture solutions segment of million in fiscal the year over year increase in net sales within this segment totaled percent  much of it driven by business in the united kingdom  continental europe  australia  and brazil 
on a weekly average basis  net sales in fiscal were percent higher than the prior year 
we achieved these increases despite downward pressure from currency exchange rates relative to fiscal levels 
in particular  our year over year net sales comparison in this segment was affected by the strengthening of the us dollar relative to the british pound sterling  euro  and japanese yen 
we estimate the change in currency exchange rates between fiscal years and effectively decreased the us dollar value of net sales in our non north american furniture solutions segment by approximately million in fiscal on a consolidated basis  changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar had a minimal effect on our net sales in fiscal relative to fiscal this is because the adverse exchange rate movements within our non north american markets were offset  in large part  by the weakening of the us dollar against the canadian dollar 
we estimate the year over year change in exchange rates effectively decreased the us dollar value of our consolidated net sales by approximately million for fiscal the remainder of our report within management s discussion and analysis focuses on what we believe to be the most significant factors affecting our consolidated financial results  without specific reference to the impact within individual business segments 
we believe discussion at this level provides the most meaningful basis for understanding the key drivers of our business performance 
refer to note for further information regarding the financial performance of our business segments in fiscal years   and percent of net sales analysis the following table presents  for the periods indicated  the components of the company s consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales 
june  fiscal year ended june  may  net sales cost of sales gross margin selling  general  and administrative expenses design and research expenses total operating expenses operating earnings net other expenses earnings before income taxes income tax expense net earnings gross margin fiscal compared to fiscal our fiscal gross margin improved basis points from the prior year level 
the leveraging of overhead expenses against higher net sales in the current year significantly contributed to this improvement 
during fiscal  direct material costs continued to pressure gross margin performance 
these cost increases were  however  more than offset by the benefit captured through our recent general price increases 
this market pricing  combined with continued manufacturing process improvements  drove a reduction in direct labor expenses on a percent of sales basis 
the improvement in direct labor was achieved despite the implementation of wage increases in the current year first quarter and inefficiencies associated with the start up of our most recent product introductions 
as a percent of sales  direct material expenses increased basis points from the fiscal level 
the direct material content associated with the launch of one of our newest lines of systems furniture drove a significant amount of this increase 
while these excess costs are typical in the initial years following product launch  the impact was exacerbated by customer demand that far outpaced our business plan for the year 
our efforts to keep pace with this demand drove additional cost into the supply chain 
market price inflation for key manufacturing inputs also contributed to the year over year increase in direct material costs 
while the costs of these key commodities  particularly steel  plastics  aluminum  and wood particleboard  stabilized in the second half of fiscal  they remain above the average price points we experienced in in total  we estimate commodity cost increases added between million and million to our consolidated direct material expenses in fiscal compared to the prior year 
we were able to offset some of this negative impact through efficiencies gained in connection with our engineering and supply management efforts under hmps 
our pricing strategy  combined with our commitment to lean manufacturing principles  continue to be our primary means of addressing the financial impact of rising material costs 
despite an increase in manufacturing overhead expenses  we improved significantly on a percent of sales basis in fiscal versus the prior year 
the expense increase was driven in part by the increase in net sales 
we also incurred higher expenses in the current year for employee benefits such as retirement programs  medical and prescription drug coverage  and annual wage increases for indirect labor employees 
partially offsetting these year over year expense increases were lower incentive bonus expenses in the current year 
our incentive bonus program is based on a measure of improvement in economic profit from year to year as opposed to an absolute level of earnings in any one period 
based on our relative performance between periods  incentive bonus expenses recorded within cost of sales in fiscal were million lower than the prior year 
freight expenses  as a percentage of sales  decreased in relation to the prior year 
we have continued to benefit from the efforts of our distribution team to consolidate shipments  increase trailer utilization  and engage the services of lower cost carriers 
additionally  our freight percentage was reduced due to the additional net sales captured as a result of the price increases 
fiscal compared to fiscal on a percent of sales basis  our fiscal gross margin improved basis points from the fiscal level 
benefits from the realization of price increases and improvements in overhead and direct labor drove much of the increase 
however  these favorable factors were partially offset by higher material and freight costs 
while actual dollar spending increased in fiscal  manufacturing overhead  as a percentage of sales  improved significantly between periods 
this was due to leverage gained against higher net sales 
the higher expenses were primarily related to medical benefits  pension  incentive compensation  utilities  and other items that vary with sales volume 
the combined expenses related to pension and incentive compensation alone for fiscal increased million over the fiscal level 
direct labor  as a percentage of sales  improved between fiscal and as a result of increased operational efficiencies and leverage gained on higher production levels 
direct material expenses increased sharply between fiscal and the key commodities which drove the bulk of the increase were aluminum  plastics  and particleboard 
despite these increases  material costs as a percentage of net sales increased only slightly in fiscal this was mainly due to the net benefit realized during the year from price increases 
freight costs  as a percentage of sales  increased approximately basis points in fiscal due to higher fuel prices and the mix of shipments to higher cost freight zones 
operating expenses fiscal compared to fiscal operating expenses in fiscal were million  or percent of net sales  compared to million  or percent of net sales in the prior fiscal year 
this represents a year over year increase of million or percent 
our fiscal operating expenses included approximately million in additional compensation costs associated with the extra week of operations 
we also incurred expenses totaling approximately million in the prior year first quarter relating to the three dealerships that were transitioned in that period 
excluding these amounts  the comparable year over year increase in operating expenses was million or percent 
a significant proportion of this increase is attributed to expenses such as designer royalties and selling related costs  which vary with net sales 
our portfolio of new product launches at the start of fiscal drove an increase in program marketing expenses relative to the prior year 
we estimate that approximately million of the year over year increase in operating expenses resulted from higher spending on incremental employee compensation including stock based compensation programs  retirement  and health benefits 
increased expenses related to charitable contributions account for million of the year over year increase 
we also incurred higher operating expenses during fiscal related to our new market expansion efforts 
specifically  the opening of our manufacturing operation in china and the launch of two new business ventures  convia and the be collection tm  contributed to the increase 
year over year changes in currency exchange rates had an inflationary impact on the operating expenses associated with our international operations  as measured in us dollars 
we estimate these changes increased our consolidated operating expenses in fiscal by approximately million relative to the prior year 
fiscal operating expenses included a pre tax charge totaling million related to a long term lease arrangement in the united kingdom 
additional information on this lease arrangement can be found in note pretax compensation expenses associated with our stock based compensation programs  the majority of which is classified within operating expenses  totaled million in fiscal this compares to million in fiscal the increase over the prior year is the result of our adoption of sfas no 
 share based payment sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal additional information on this accounting standard  including our method of transition and prior accounting practice  can be found in note design and research costs included in total operating expenses were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
these expenses include royalty payments to the designers of our products 
we consider such royalty payments  which totaled million and million in fiscal years and  respectively  to be variable costs of the products being sold 
accordingly  we do not include them in research and development costs as discussed in note fiscal compared to fiscal as a percentage of net sales  operating expenses in fiscal declined basis points from the fiscal level due to improved operating leverage against higher sales dollars 
total dollar spending in fiscal was  however  million higher than the fiscal level 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded a significant reserve adjustment  which resulted in a reduction to our fiscal operating expenses 
in april  we reported that we had reached a settlement with the general services administration gsa concerning a prior audit of the to multiple award schedule contract 
in light of the settlement  which required us to pay the gsa million  we reevaluated our balance sheet reserves related to all gsa contract periods 
as a result of this evaluation  we made the determination that these reserves should be reduced 
accordingly  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded an adjustment to the reserves  which reduced our pre tax operating expenses by approximately million 
approximately million of this adjustment related to the elimination of the remaining reserves  beyond the amount of the settlement  allocable to the to contract period 
the remainder of the adjustment related to our reevaluation of required reserves for open contract periods that had not yet been subject to audit 
the dealership transitions that occurred in the first quarter of fiscal had a significant impact on the year over year operating expense comparison 
our fiscal results reflect approximately million in operating expenses associated with these dealers 
by comparison  our fiscal operating expenses included million related to these transitioned dealers 
excluding the comparative impact of the dealership transitions and fiscal gsa reserve adjustment  operating expenses in fiscal were approximately million higher than in fiscal the majority of the increased operating expenses between fiscal and resulted from higher variable selling costs tied to the increase in sales volume 
incentive compensation  product warranty  pension  medical insurance  legal  marketing  new product development  and charitable donation expenses also contributed to the increase 
specifically  combined expenses in fiscal related to incentive compensation  pension  and donations increased million over the fiscal level 
the increase in warranty expenses between fiscal and was mainly driven by the increase in net sales for the period 
in addition  a portion of the increase was due to the establishment of liabilities for specific warranty matters that became known during the year 
the majority of these matters related to products manufactured prior to the implementation of our current quality testing protocol 
refer to note for further information regarding product warranty 
the increase in legal expenses between fiscal and was partially due to costs incurred in defending our intellectual property assets 
we also incurred expenses during fiscal in establishing our legal trading structure in mainland china 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we established an estimated liability associated with the previously disclosed new york attorney general investigation regarding the minimum advertised price program maintained by our herman miller for the home division 
for further information regarding pending legal contingencies  refer to note we estimate the year over year change in exchange rates effectively decreased the us dollar value of our international operating expenses by million in fiscal relative to fiscal design and research costs included in operating expenses totaled million in fiscal this amount includes designer royalty expenses of million 
as discussed above  our fiscal operating expenses included a pre tax charge totaling million related to a long term lease arrangement in the united kingdom 
operating earnings fiscal operating earnings were million 
this is an increase of from our fiscal level of million 
as a percentage of net sales  operating earnings in fiscal totaled percent  representing a basis point improvement over the prior year 
in fiscal year  we reported operating earnings of million or percent of net sales 
other expenses and income net other expenses totaled million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year and million in fiscal the increase in expense between fiscal and was principally driven by lower interest income in the current year due to a reduction in our average cash and cash equivalents balance between periods 
additionally  the net foreign currency transaction gain in fiscal was less than million compared to a net gain of million last year 
the year over year increase in net other expenses between fiscal years and resulted primarily from two dealership transactions in fiscal during the first quarter of that year  we recorded a pre tax gain of million related to the ownership transition of a previously consolidated vie 
also during the first quarter of fiscal  we acquired certain assets and liabilities of an independent contract furniture dealership 
in doing so  we recognized a pre tax gain of million due to the reversal of a financial guarantee liability 
these gains were reflected as a reduction to net other expenses in fiscal foreign currency transactions recorded during fiscal resulted in a net gain of million 
income taxes our effective tax rate was percent in fiscal versus percent in fiscal the current year effective rate was below the statutory rate of percent primarily due to million in tax credits for foreign taxes  other credits for r d activities  and tax incentives for export sales and domestic manufacturing 
the effective rate in fiscal was lower than the statutory rate due mainly to tax benefits from r d activities  tax incentives for export sales and domestic manufacturing  and certain adjustments to recognize certain foreign deferred tax assets 
our effective tax rate in fiscal was percent 
the fiscal effective rate was higher than the statutory rate due primarily to a million tax charge  recorded in the fourth quarter of that year  related to our planned cash repatriation under the american jobs creations act of ajca 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we also recorded tax adjustments driven by tax law changes  as well as other federal  state  and international accrual adjustments 
we expect our effective tax rate for fiscal to be between and percent 
for further information regarding income taxes  refer to note net earnings net earnings and diluted earnings per share in fiscal were million and  respectively 
this compares to our fiscal net earnings and diluted earnings per share of million and  respectively 
in fiscal  we generated net earnings of million or per diluted share 
earnings per share in fiscal included income of approximately per share  net of taxes  from the adjustment to gsa reserves as previously discussed 
in addition  net earnings in fiscal were reduced by approximately per diluted share from taxes related to our then anticipated cash repatriation under the ajca 
liquidity and capital resources the table below presents certain key cash flow and capital highlights for the fiscal years indicated 
in millions cash and cash equivalents  end of period short term investments  end of period cash generated from operating activities cash used for investing activities cash used for financing activities pension and post retirement benefit plan contributions capital expenditures stock repurchased and retired interest bearing debt  end of period available unsecured credit facility  end of period amounts shown include the fair market value of the company s interest rate swap arrangements 
the net fair value of these arrangements was million at june   million at june   and negligible at may  amounts shown are net of outstanding letters of credit  which are applied against the company s unsecured credit facility  excluding the million accordion feature disclosed in note cash flow operating activities cash generated from operating activities in fiscal totaled million compared to million in the prior year 
changes in working capital balances resulted in a million use of cash in the current fiscal year compared to a million source of cash in the prior year 
the majority of the working capital investment in fiscal related to increases in inventory and accounts receivable 
the significant growth within our non north american furniture solutions segment resulted in a substantial increase in both inventory and accounts receivable over the past year 
the opening of our manufacturing operation in china was a contributing factor to the inventory increase as was the general growth in sales activity across our international regions 
the accounts receivable balances within this segment tend to have a longer cash collection cycle than we experience in north america 
as sales within this segment grow in proportion to the total business  we expect to see a corresponding increase in the absolute aging of our receivable balances 
another contributing factor to the working capital investment during fiscal relates to our business with the us federal government 
order activity with the federal government increased significantly during the year  particularly during the first and second quarters 
these sales generally require a longer cash collection cycle than do sales to independent contract furniture dealers 
accordingly  we experienced a related increase in accounts receivable 
inventory levels have also been affected by this growth in federal government business  since we are generally required to hold product in inventory longer than with non government business 
this extended inventory holding period is necessary to be consistent with our revenue recognition policy for direct customer sales 
the source of working capital cash flow in fiscal resulted principally from an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  namely employee compensation and warranty accruals 
this was partially offset by volume related increases in accounts receivable and inventory levels 
in fiscal year  cash flows from operating activities totaled million 
changes in working capital balances in that fiscal year resulted in a net source of cash of million 
this was driven by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities for employee compensation  other employee benefits  and income taxes 
partially offsetting these favorable balance changes were volume related increases during the year in inventory and accounts receivable 
collections of accounts receivable remained strong throughout the year  and we believe our recorded accounts receivable valuation allowances at the end of fiscal are adequate to cover the risk of potential bad debts 
allowances for non collectible accounts receivable  as a percent of gross accounts receivable  totaled   and percent at the end of fiscal years   and  respectively 
the reduction in these percentages over this time period was driven by a general improvement in the quality of our aged receivable balances 
included in operating cash flows are cash contributions made to our employee pension and post retirement benefit plans which totaled million  million  and million in fiscal years   and  respectively 
for further information regarding the company s pension and post retirement benefit plans  including information relative to the funded status of these plans  refer to note cash flow investing activities capital expenditures totaled million in fiscal and million in the prior fiscal year 
the higher spending last year was driven by the large number of new product introductions and the construction of an office and showroom facility in the united kingdom 
cash outflows for investing activities in fiscal included capital expenditures of million 
at the end of fiscal  we had outstanding commitments for future capital purchases of approximately million 
we expect capital spending in fiscal to be between million and million 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we completed the sale of a facility located in canton  georgia 
this facility was exited during fiscal and  since that time  has been listed for sale 
at the end of fiscal  the related assets were classified in the consolidated balance sheet under the caption  net property and equipment  at a net carrying value of million 
proceeds received in connection with the sale of this facility during fiscal totaled million and are reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows as proceeds from sales of property and equipment 
included in our fiscal investing activities is a million outflow related to the acquisition of a technology company 
the purchase of this company is intended to provide enhanced functionality to the existing product portfolio under our recently launched convia subsidiary 
in the first quarter of fiscal  cash flows from investing activities included a payment of million related to the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of a contract furniture dealership based in oklahoma 
these acquisitions are discussed further in note as previously discussed  we sold two wholly owned contract furniture dealerships during the first quarter of fiscal proceeds received in connection with these sales  which had the effect of increasing cash flows from investing activities  totaled million 
net cash received from the repayment of notes receivable in fiscal related primarily to a payment received from a contract dealership previously consolidated under fin r 
as mentioned earlier in this report  this vie was able to obtain financing with an outside bank and  therefore  was able to repay a large portion of its debt owed to us during the first quarter of fiscal cash flow financing activities in millions  except share and per share data shares acquired    cost of shares acquired average cost per share acquired shares issued    average price per share issued cash dividends paid share repurchases were the most significant factor affecting cash outflows from financing activities during the past three fiscal years 
our board of directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal including this most recent approval  the amount remaining under our share repurchase authorizations at the end of fiscal totaled million 
our board of directors also increased the rate of our quarterly cash dividend in each of the last two fiscal years 
the first of these increases was in the third quarter of fiscal and allowed for an approximate percent increase in the quarterly rate 
the second board approval  which provided for a percent rate increase  was granted in the fourth quarter of fiscal this most recent increase brought our quarterly cash dividend to per share 
interest bearing debt at the end of fiscal of million decreased million from million at the end of fiscal the decrease related primarily to a scheduled million payment we made during the fourth quarter of fiscal on our private placement notes 
this payment was partially offset by a million increase in the fair value of our interest rate swap instruments 
debt repayments made during fiscal totaled million 
our next scheduled repayment is for million to be made in the fourth quarter of fiscal the combined fair values of our interest rate swap arrangements  as further described in note  was negative million at the end of fiscal compared to negative million at the end of fiscal the fair values of these swap arrangements change based on fluctuations in market interest rates 
such changes are not included in net earnings of the related period 
instead  they are reflected as adjustments to our consolidated assets and or liabilities 
at the end of fiscal  the portion of our total interest bearing debt that was effectively converted to a variable rate basis through our swap arrangements was million 
these interest rate swaps had the effect of increasing total interest expense by million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
conversely  during fiscal  the swaps resulted in a net interest expense reduction of approximately million 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we paid off million of notes payable associated with one of the vie s initially consolidated under fin r as further described in note the only usage against our unsecured revolving credit facility at the end of fiscal years and represented outstanding standby letters of credit totaling million and million  respectively 
the provisions of our private placement notes and unsecured credit facility require that we adhere to certain covenant restrictions and maintain certain performance ratios 
we were in compliance with all such restrictions and performance ratios during fiscal and expect to remain in compliance in the future 
partially offsetting the effects of our share repurchases  dividend payments  and debt payments was cash received related to stock based benefit plans 
during fiscal  we received million from the issuance of shares in connection with these plans 
by comparison  we received million and million from the issuance of shares in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
at the end of fiscal year  we reported our plan to take advantage of the one time tax deduction related to the repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings under the ajca 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we repatriated approximately million of undistributed earnings from certain of our foreign entities 
an additional million of undistributed foreign earnings was repatriated during the second quarter of fiscal our dividend reinvestment plan required these funds to be used for capital purchases and investment in research and development 
we believe cash on hand  cash generated from operations  and our borrowing capacity will provide adequate liquidity to fund near term and future business operations and capital needs 
contingencies as previously reported  the company has received a subpoena from the new york attorney general s office requesting certain information relating to the minimum advertised price program maintained by the herman miller for the home division 
in connection with this matter  the new york attorney general s office has taken depositions of current and former employees of the company and certain dealers 
the company and the new york attorney general s office have had preliminary discussions regarding possible methods of resolving the matter 
the company has reserved its best estimate of a potential amount to resolve this matter 
the accrued amount is not material to the company s consolidated financial position 
the company leases a facility in the uk under an agreement that expires in march under the terms of the lease  the company is required to perform the maintenance and repairs necessary to address the general dilapidation of the facility over the lease term 
the ultimate cost of this provision to the company is dependent on a number of factors including  but not limited to  the future use of the facility by the lessor and whether the company chooses and is permitted to renew the lease term 
the company has estimated the cost of these maintenance and repairs to be between and million  depending on the outcome of future plans and negotiations 
based on existing circumstances  it is estimated that these costs will most likely approximate million 
as a result  this amount has been recorded as a liability reflected under the caption other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as of june   and june  in may  the company assigned its rights as lessee of a uk facility to a third party under an agreement that contained a provision granting the third party the right to re assign the lease to the company after years  at its election 
during fiscal  the company was notified by the third party that it is no longer using the space and intends to exercise the re assignment option 
the original lease term expires in may the company believes it will be able to assign or sublet the lease for the majority of the remaining lease term to another tenant at current market rates 
however  current market rates for comparable office space are lower than the rental payments owed under the lease agreement 
as such  the company would remain liable to pay the difference 
as a result  the company recorded a pre tax charge of million in fiscal for the expected loss under the arrangement 
the corresponding impact of this charge on fiscal net earnings was million  net of a million tax benefit  or approximately per diluted share 
as of june  and june   the future cost of this arrangement was estimated to be million 
accordingly this amount is reflected within other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of these dates 
the company is also involved in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
it is the company s opinion that the outcome of such proceedings and litigation currently pending will not materially affect its consolidated financial statements 
basis of presentation the company s fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to may the year ended june  fiscal year included weeks of operations 
in contrast  fiscal year  which ended on june   included weeks of operations 
the year ended may  was comprised of weeks 
this is the basis upon which all of the above weekly average data is presented 
the extra week in fiscal was required to realign our fiscal calendar with the actual calendar months 
this is required approximately every six years 
contractual obligations contractual obligations associated with our ongoing business and financing activities will result in cash payments in future periods 
the following table summarizes the amounts and estimated timing of these future cash payments 
further information regarding debt obligations can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
likewise  further information related to operating leases can be found in note in millions payments due by fiscal year contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt estimated interest on debt obligations operating leases purchase obligations pension plan funding shareholder dividends other total amounts indicated do not include the recorded fair value of interest rate swap instruments 
estimated future interest payments on our outstanding debt obligations are based on interest rates as of june  actual cash outflows may differ significantly due to changes in underlying interest rates and timing of principal payments 
purchase obligations consist of non cancelable purchase orders and commitments for goods  services  and capital assets 
pension funding commitments are defined as the estimated minimum funding requirements to be made in the following month period 
as of june   the total accumulated benefit obligation for our domestic and international employee pension benefit plans was million 
represents the recorded dividend payable as of june  future dividend payments are not considered contractual obligations until declared 
other contractual obligations represent long term commitments related to deferred and supplemental employee compensation benefits  minimum designer royalty payments  and scheduled commitments related to the acquisition of intellectual property rights 
total balance is reflected as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet at june  off balance sheet arrangements guarantees we provide certain guarantees to third parties under various arrangements in the form of product warranties  loan guarantees  standby letters of credit  lease guarantees  performance bonds  and indemnification provisions 
these arrangements are accounted for and disclosed in accordance with fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirement for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
variable interest entities on occasion  we provide financial support to certain independent dealers in the form of term loans  lines of credit  and loan guarantees 
at june  and june   we were not considered the primary beneficiary of any such dealer relationships as defined by fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin r and therefore  no entities were included as vies as of these dates 
the risks and rewards associated with our interests in these dealerships are primarily limited to our outstanding loans and guarantee amounts 
as of june  and june   our maximum exposure to potential losses related to outstanding loans to these dealerships totaled million and million  respectively 
information on our exposure related to outstanding loan guarantees provided to such entities is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  a qualifying triggering event occurred with a previously consolidated vie which resulted in reconsideration under fin r 
based on this reconsideration  it was determined we were no longer considered the primary beneficiary 
as such  we ceased consolidation of the independent dealership in the first quarter of fiscal net earnings in the first quarter of fiscal were not significantly affected by the consolidation of this vie 
this is because the net earnings of the vie were primarily attributed to  and therefore offset by  minority interest of million 
during fiscal  a qualifying triggering event occurred with a previously consolidated vie which resulted in reconsideration under fin r 
based on this reconsideration  it was determined that we were no longer considered the primary beneficiary 
as such  we recorded the ownership transition and ceased consolidation of the dealership in the first quarter of fiscal this resulted in a pre tax gain of million  which we recorded as other expenses income in the consolidated statement of operations 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on fin r 
critical accounting policies and estimates our goal is to report financial results clearly and understandably 
we follow us generally accepted accounting principles in preparing our consolidated financial statements  which require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations 
we continually review our accounting policies and financial information disclosures 
these policies and disclosures are reviewed at least annually with the audit committee of the board of directors 
following is a summary of our more significant accounting policies that require the use of estimates and judgments in preparing the financial statements 
revenue recognition as described in the executive overview  the majority of our products and services are sold through one of four channels independent contract furniture dealers and licensees  owned contract furniture dealers  direct to end customers  and independent retailers 
we recognize revenue on sales to independent dealers  licensees  and retailers once the product is shipped and title passes to the buyer 
when we sell product directly to the end customer or to owned dealers  we recognize revenue once the product and services are delivered and installation is substantially complete 
amounts recorded as net sales generally include freight charged to customers  with the related freight expenses recognized within cost of sales 
items such as discounts off list price  rebates  and other sale related marketing program expenses are recorded as reductions to net sales 
we record accruals for rebates and other marketing programs  which require us to make estimates about future customer buying patterns and market conditions 
customer sales that reach or fail to reach certain levels can affect the amount of such estimates  and actual results could differ from our estimates 
receivable allowances we base our allowances related to receivables on known customer exposures  historical credit experience  and the specific identification of other potential problems  including the economic climate 
these methods are applied to all major receivables  including trade  lease  and notes receivable 
in addition  we follow a policy that consistently applies reserve rates based on the age of outstanding accounts receivable 
actual collections can differ from our historical experience  and if economic or business conditions deteriorate significantly  adjustments to these reserves may be required 
the accounts receivable allowance totaled million and million at june  and june   respectively 
as a percentage of gross accounts receivable  these allowances totaled percent and percent  respectively 
the year over year reduction in the allowance percentage is attributable to a general improvement in the quality of our accounts receivable aging 
goodwill the carrying value of our goodwill assets as of june  and june   totaled million 
we account for our goodwill assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
under this accounting guidance  we are required to perform an annual test on our goodwill assets by reporting unit to determine whether the asset values are impaired 
if impairment is determined  we are required to reduce the net carrying value of the assets to their estimated fair market value 
our impairment testing model is based on the present value of projected cash flows and a residual value 
in completing the test under this approach  we assume that the value of a business today is derived from the cash flows it will generate in the future 
we also assume that such future cash flows can be reasonably estimated 
while these projected cash flows reflect our best estimate of future reporting unit performance  actual cash flows could differ significantly 
the results of this test  performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal  indicated that our net goodwill asset values were not impaired 
we employed a market based approach in selecting the discount rates used in our analysis 
by this  we mean the discount rates selected represent market rates of return equal to what we believe a reasonable investor would expect to achieve on investments of similar size to our reporting units 
we believe the discount rates selected in our testing are conservative in that  in all cases  they exceed the estimated weighted average cost of capital for our business as a whole 
the results of the impairment test are sensitive to changes in the discount rates 
our testing performed in fiscal indicated that a substantial increase in the discount rates utilized would be required before the results would indicate a potential impairment issue 
warranty reserve we stand behind our products and keep our promises to customers 
from time to time  quality issues arise resulting in the need to incur costs to correct problems with products or services 
we have established warranty reserves for the various costs associated with these guarantees 
general warranty reserves are based on historical claims experience and periodically adjusted for business levels 
specific reserves are established once an issue is identified 
the valuation of such reserves is based on the estimated costs to correct the problem 
actual costs may vary and may result in an adjustment to our reserves 
inventory reserves inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the inventories at the majority of our manufacturing operations are valued using the last in  first out lifo method  whereas inventories of certain other subsidiaries are valued using the first in  first out fifo method 
we establish reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  based on material movement and judgment for consideration of current events  such as economic conditions  that may affect inventory 
the amount of reserve required to record inventory at lower of cost or market may be adjusted as conditions change 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities  and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
we have net operating loss nol carryforwards available in certain jurisdictions to reduce future taxable income 
we also have foreign tax credits available in certain jurisdictions to reduce future tax due 
future tax benefits for nol carryforwards and foreign tax credits are recognized to the extent that realization of these benefits is considered more likely than not 
we base this determination on the expectation that related operations will be sufficiently profitable or various tax planning strategies available to us will enable us to utilize the nol carryforwards and or foreign tax credits 
when information becomes available that raises doubts about the realization of a deferred income tax asset  a valuation allowance is established 
self insurance reserves with the assistance of independent actuaries  we establish reserves for workers compensation and general liability exposures 
the reserves are established based on expected future claims for incurred losses 
we also establish reserves for health benefit exposures based on historical claims information along with certain assumptions about future trends 
the methods and assumptions used to determine the liabilities are applied consistently  although actual claims experience can vary 
we also maintain insurance coverage for certain risk exposures through traditional premium based insurance policies 
pension and other post retirement benefits the determination of the obligation and expense for pension and other post retirement benefits depends on certain actuarial assumptions 
among the most significant of these assumptions are the discount rate  interest crediting rate  and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
we determine these assumptions as follows 
discount rate this assumption is established at the end of the fiscal year based on high quality corporate bond yields 
we utilize the services of an independent actuarial firm to analyze and recommend an appropriate rate 
for our domestic pension and other post retirement benefit plans  the actuary uses a cash flow matching technique  which compares the estimated future cash flows of the plan to a published discount curve showing the relationship between interest rates and duration for hypothetical zero coupon fixed income investments 
we set the discount rate for our international pension plan based on the yield level of a commonly used corporate bond index 
because the average duration of the bonds underlying this index is less than that of our international pension plan liabilities  the index yield is used as a reference point 
the final discount rate  which takes into consideration the index yield and the difference in comparative durations  is based on a recommendation from our independent actuarial consultant 
the discount rates selected for our domestic pension and post retirement benefit plans at the end of fiscal were lower than those established at the end of fiscal with all other assumptions and values held constant  this change would result in an increase in our pension and post retirement benefit plan expenses for our fiscal year  which began on june  conversely  the discount rate selected for our international pension plan at the end of the current year was higher than the rate established at the end of fiscal this change would result in a decrease in our international pension plan expense for fiscal if all other assumptions were held constant 
interest crediting rate we use this assumption in accounting for our primary domestic pension plan  which is a cash balance type plan 
the rate  which represents the annual rate of interest applied to each plan participant s account balance  is established at an assumed level  or spread  below the discount rate 
we base this methodology on the historical spread between the year us treasury and high quality corporate bond yields 
this relationship is examined annually to determine whether the methodology is appropriate 
expected long term rate of return we base this assumption on our long term assumed rates of return for equities and fixed income securities  weighted by the allocation of the invested assets of the pension plan 
we consider risk factors specific to the various classes of investments and advice from independent actuaries in establishing this rate 
changes in the investment allocation of plan assets would impact this assumption 
a shift to a higher relative percentage of fixed income securities  for example  would result in a lower assumed rate 
while this assumption represents our long term market return expectation  actual asset returns can differ from year to year 
such differences give rise to actuarial gains and losses 
in years where actual market returns are lower than the assumed rate  an actuarial loss is generated 
conversely  an actuarial gain results when actual market returns exceed the assumed rate in a given year 
as of june   and june   the net actuarial loss associated with our employee pension and post retirement benefit plans totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
at both dates  the majority of this unrecognized loss was associated with lower than expected plan asset returns 
for purposes of determining annual net pension expense  we use a calculated method for determining the market related value of plan assets 
under this method  we recognize the change in fair value of plan assets systematically over a five year period 
accordingly  a portion of our net actuarial loss is deferred 
the remaining portion of the net actuarial loss is subject to amortization expense each year 
the amortization period used in determining this expense is the estimated remaining working life of active pension plan participants 
we currently estimate this period to be approximately years 
as of the beginning of fiscal year  the deferred net actuarial loss ie  the portion of the total net actuarial loss not subject to amortization was approximately million 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions used for employee benefit plans 
long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets and acquired businesses for indicators of impairment when events or circumstances indicate that a risk may be present 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment are based on market conditions  operational performance  and estimated future cash flows 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired  an impairment charge is recorded to adjust the asset to its estimated fair value 
stock based compensation we view stock based compensation as a key component of total compensation for certain of our employees  non employee directors and officers 
we account for these programs  which include grants of restricted stock  restricted stock units  employee stock purchase  and stock options  in accordance with sfas r 
under this guidance we recognize compensation expense related to each of these share based arrangements 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model in estimating the fair value of stock options issued in connection with our compensation program 
this pricing model requires the use of several input assumptions 
among the most significant of these assumptions are the expected volatility of our common stock price  and the expected timing of future stock option exercises 
expected volatility this represents a measure  expressed as a percentage  of the expected fluctuation in the market price of our common stock 
as a point of reference  a high volatility percentage would assume a wider expected range of market returns for a particular security 
all other assumptions held constant  this would yield a higher stock option valuation than a calculation using a lower measure of volatility 
in measuring the fair value of stock options issued during fiscal year  we utilized an expected volatility of percent 
expected term of options this assumption represents the expected length of time between the grant date of a stock option and the date at which it is exercised option life 
we assumed an average expected term of years in calculating the fair values of the majority of stock options issued during fiscal refer to note for further discussion on our stock based compensation plans 
contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we encounter matters which raise the potential for contingent liabilities 
in evaluating these matters for accounting treatment and disclosure  we are required to apply judgment in order to determine the probability that a liability has been incurred 
we are also required to measure  if possible  the dollar value of such liabilities in determining whether or not recognition in our financial statements is required 
this process involves the use of estimates which may differ from actual outcomes 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for more information relating to contingencies 
new accounting standards in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs sfas 
this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
sfas requires those items to be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  this statement requires fixed production overhead expenses to be allocated to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
we adopted sfas in the first quarter of fiscal  and the resulting impact on our consolidated financial statements was not material 
in december  the fasb issued a revision of sfas no 
 share based payment sfas r  which supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
this statement focuses primarily on transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in exchange for share based payments 
under sfas r  a public entity generally is required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award  with such cost recognized over the requisite service period 
this new accounting treatment is also required for any share based payments to our board of directors 
sfas r also requires an entity to provide certain disclosures in order to assist in understanding the nature of share based payment transactions and the effects of those transactions on the financial statements 
we adopted the provisions of sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal further information regarding the method of adoption and the resulting impact on net earnings and earnings per share is provided in note in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
the interpretation also provides guidance for the measurement and classification of tax positions  interest and penalties  and requires additional disclosure on an annual basis 
we plan to adopt the provisions fin effective june   as required 
we have not yet determined the effect the adoption of the interpretation will have on our consolidated financial statements  however  we do not anticipate a material impact 
any difference between the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements prior to the adoption of the interpretation and the amounts reported after the adoption will be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment recorded in the beginning balance of retained earnings on june  and will not require restatement of prior periods 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
this new standard establishes a framework for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities 
this framework is intended to provide increased consistency in how fair value determinations are made under various existing accounting standards that permit  or in some cases require  estimates of fair market value 
sfas also expands financial statement disclosure requirements about a company s use of fair value measurements  including the effect of such measures on earnings 
we are required to adopt this new accounting guidance at the beginning of fiscal while we are currently evaluating the provisions of sfas  the adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas 
sfas amends sfas no 
employers accounting for pensions  sfas no 
employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  sfas no 
employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions and sfas employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
the amendments retain most of the existing measurement and disclosure guidance and will not change the amounts recognized in our consolidated statements of operations 
sfas requires companies to recognize a net asset or liability with an offset to equity  by which the defined benefit postretirement obligation is over funded or under funded 
sfas requires prospective application  and the recognition and disclosure requirements are effective for our fiscal year ending june  further information regarding our method of adoption and the resulting impact on our consolidated financial statements is provided in note in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas expands the use of fair value measurement by permitting entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
we are required to adopt sfas at the beginning of fiscal and are currently in the process of evaluating the applicability and potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
forward looking statements certain statements in this filing are not historical facts but are forward looking statements as defined under section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act  as amended 
such statements are based on management s belief  assumptions  current expectations  estimates and projections about the office furniture industry  the economy and the company itself 
words like anticipates  believes  confident  estimates  expects  forecast  likely  plans  projects  and should  and variations of such words and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
these statements do not guarantee future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties  and assumptions that are difficult to predict with regard to timing  expense  likelihood and degree of occurrence 
these risks include  without limitation  employment and general economic conditions in the us and in our international markets  the increase in white collar employment  the willingness of customers to undertake capital expenditures  the types of products purchased by customers  the possibility of order cancellations or deferrals by customers  competitive pricing pressures  the availability and pricing of direct materials  our reliance on a limited number of suppliers  currency fluctuations  the ability to increase prices to absorb the additional costs of direct materials  the financial strength of our dealers  the financial strength of our customers  the mix of our products purchased by customers  our ability to attract and retain key executives and other qualified employees  our ability to continue to make product innovations  the strength of the intellectual property relating to our products  the success of newly introduced products  our ability to serve all of our markets  possible acquisitions  divestitures or alliances  the outcome of pending litigation or governmental audits or investigations  and other risks identified in this form k and our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
therefore  actual results and outcomes may materially differ from what we express or forecast

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company manufactures  markets  and sells its products throughout the world and  as a result  is subject to changing economic conditions  which could reduce the demand for its products 
direct material costs the company is exposed to risks arising from price changes for certain direct materials and assembly components used in its operations 
the largest such costs incurred by the company are for steel  plastic textiles  wood particleboard  and aluminum components 
commodity prices increased relative to the prior year during fiscal  particularly during the first half of the year 
this was followed by a period of price stabilization  and in the case steel  improvement  during the second half of the fiscal year 
for the full year  the company estimates rising commodity prices added between million and million to its consolidated cost of sales compared to fiscal the market price of steel  in particular  was relatively stable during fiscal and  in fact  improved slightly relative to the prior year 
consequently  it did not have a significant impact on the year over year gross margin comparison between fiscal years and however  the company did experience price increases for other key manufacturing inputs during fiscal during fiscal  the price of steel increased significantly 
as a result  the company estimates its direct material costs for steel components in fiscal increased between million and million in comparison to fiscal the market price of plastics and textiles are sensitive to the cost of oil and natural gas 
oil and natural gas prices increased sharply during the latter half of fiscal and throughout fiscal in fiscal  petroleum prices declined somewhat  however  showed continued volatility 
as a result  the cost of plastics and textiles increased during fiscal years and in fiscal  these market prices moderated somewhat 
in addition to the market dynamics of supply and demand  the cost of wood particleboard has been impacted by continual downsizing of production capacity in the wood market as well as increased costs in transportation related to oil increases 
aluminum component prices have risen in part due to high market demand and increased energy costs associated with the conversion of raw materials to aluminum ingots 
the company believes future market price increases on its key direct materials and assembly components are likely 
consequently  it views the prospect of such increases as an outlook risk to the business 
foreign exchange risk the company manufactures its products in the united states  united kingdom  and china 
it also sources completed products and product components from outside the united states 
the company s completed products are sold in numerous countries around the world 
sales in foreign countries as well as certain expenses related to those sales are transacted in currencies other than the company s reporting currency  the us dollar 
accordingly  production costs and profit margins related to these sales are affected by the currency exchange relationship between the countries where the sales take place and the countries where the products are sourced or manufactured 
these currency exchange relationships can also affect the company s competitive positions within these markets 
in the normal course of business  the company enters into contracts denominated in foreign currencies 
the principal foreign currencies in which the company conducts its business are the british pound  euro  canadian dollar  japanese yen  mexican peso  and chinese renminbi 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company entered into three separate forward currency contracts in order to offset million of its euro net asset exposure denominated in a non functional currency 
similarly  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company entered into a single forward currency contract to offset million of its euro net asset exposure 
in both years  the instruments were marked to market at the end of the period  with changes in fair value reflected in net earnings 
at june  and june   the fair values of the instruments were negligible 
net gains arising from remeasuring all foreign currency transactions into the appropriate functional currency  which were included in net earnings  totaled million  and million for the years ended june  and may   respectively 
the net currency transaction gain in the year ended june  was negligible 
additionally  the cumulative effect of translating the balance sheet and income statement accounts from the functional currency into the united states dollar reduced the accumulated comprehensive loss component of total shareholders equity by million  million  and million for the years ended june   june   and may   respectively 
interest rate risk the company maintains fixed rate debt 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect fair market value but not earnings or cash flows 
the company does not have an incentive to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity  and as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on such debt until the company would be required to refinance it 
the company has two separate interest rate swap instruments that  as of the end of fiscal year  effectively convert million in total of fixed rate debt to a variable rate basis 
this debt is subject to changes in interest rates  which  if significant  could have a material impact on the company s financial results 
the interest rate swap derivative instruments are held and used by the company as a tool for managing interest rate risk 
they are not used for trading or speculative purposes 
the counterparties to these swap instruments are large financial institutions that the company believes are of high quality creditworthiness 
while the company may be exposed to potential losses due to the credit risk of non performance by these counterparties  such losses are not anticipated 
the combined fair market value of effective swap instruments was negative million at june   in comparison to negative million at june  the impact of these swap instruments on total interest expense was an addition to interest expense of approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
in fiscal  the swap instruments reduced total interest expense by approximately million 
all cash flows related to the company s interest rate swap instruments are denominated in us dollars 
for further information  refer to notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
as of june   the weighted average interest rate on the company s variable rate debt was approximately percent
