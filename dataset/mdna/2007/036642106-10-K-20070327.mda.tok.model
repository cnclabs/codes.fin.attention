item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with item a 
risk factors and our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
some of the statements in the following discussion are forward looking statements 
see special note regarding forward looking statements 
overview the company develops  produces and markets pharmaceutical delivery products  including transdermal gels  oral fast melting tablets and reusable needle free and disposable mini needle injector systems 
in addition  the company has several products and compound formulations under development 
the company has operating facilities in the us and switzerland 
the us operation develops reusable needle free and disposable mini needle injector systems and manufactures and markets reusable needle free injection devices and related disposables 
these operations  including all manufacturing and some us administrative activities  are located in minneapolis  minnesota 
the company also has operations located in basel  switzerland  which consist of administration and facilities for the development of transdermal gels and oral fast melt tablet products 
the swiss operations focus principally on research  development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products and include a number of license agreements with pharmaceutical companies for the application of its drug delivery systems 
the company s corporate offices are located in ewing  new jersey 
the company operates as a specialty pharmaceutical company in the broader pharmaceutical industry 
companies in this sector generally bring technology and know how in the area of drug formulation and or delivery to pharmaceutical product marketers through licensing and development agreements while actively pursuing development of its own products 
the company currently views pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as primary customers 
the company has negotiated and executed licensing relationships in the growth hormone segment reusable needle free devices in europe and asia and the transdermal gels segment several development programs in place worldwide  including the united states and europe 
in addition  the company continues to market reusable needle free devices for the home or alternate site administration of insulin in the us market through distributors  has granted a development license to its reusable needle free technology in the diabetes and obesity fields to eli lilly and company on a worldwide basis  and has licensed both disposable and reusable injection devices to teva pharmaceuticals for use in undisclosed fields and territories 
the company is reporting a net loss of  for the year ended december  and expects to report a net loss for the year ending december   as marketing and development costs related to bringing future generations of products to market continue 
long term capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the status of collaborative arrangements and payments received under such arrangements  the progress of research and development programs  the receipt of revenues from sales of products and royalties and the ability to control costs 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates in preparing the financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  management must make decisions that impact reported amounts and related disclosures 
such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates 
in reaching such decisions  management applies judgment based on its understanding and analysis of relevant circumstances 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides a summary of the significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the following accounting policies are considered by management to be the most critical to the presentation of the consolidated financial statements because they require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
revenue recognition the majority of the company s revenue relates to product sales for which revenue is recognized upon shipment  with limited judgment required related to product returns 
product sales are shipped fob shipping point 
the company also enters into license arrangements that are often complex as they may involve a license  development and manufacturing components 
licensing revenue recognition requires significant management judgment to evaluate the effective terms of agreements  the company s performance commitments and determination of fair value of the various deliverables under the arrangement 
in december  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which addresses certain aspects of revenue recognition for arrangements that include multiple revenue generating activities 
eitf addresses when and  if so  how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting 
in some arrangements  the different revenue generating activities deliverables are sufficiently separable  and there exists sufficient evidence of their fair values to separately account for some or all of the deliverables that is  there are separate units of accounting 
in other arrangements  some or all of the deliverables are not independently functional  or there is not sufficient evidence of their fair values to account for them separately 
the company s ability to establish objective evidence of fair value for the deliverable portions of the contracts may significantly impact the time period over which revenues will be recognized 
for instance  if there is no objective fair value of undelivered elements of a contract  then the company may be required to treat a multi deliverable contract as one unit of accounting  resulting in all revenue being deferred and recognized over the entire contract period 
eitf does not change otherwise applicable revenue recognition criteria 
in arrangements where the deliverables cannot be separated  revenue related to up front  time based and performance based payments is being recognized over the entire contract performance period 
for major licensing contracts  this results in the deferral of significant revenue amounts  at december  where non refundable cash payments have been received  but the revenue is not immediately recognized due to the long term nature of the respective agreements 
subsequent factors affecting the initial estimate of the effective terms of agreements could either increase or decrease the period over which the deferred revenue is recognized 
in connection with a license agreement entered into with eli lilly and company in  the company issued to lilly a ten year warrant to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at an exercise price of per share 
at the time of issue  the company determined that the fair value of the warrant was  using the black scholes option pricing model 
eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  requires that the value of the warrants be treated as a reduction in revenue 
the fair value of the warrant was recorded to additional paid in capital and to prepaid license discount  a contra equity account 
the prepaid license discount will be reduced on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement  offsetting revenue generated under the agreement 
if during its periodic impairment assessment the company concludes that the revenues from this arrangement will not exceed the costs  including prepaid license discount  part or all of the remaining prepaid license discount would be charged to operations at that time 
due to the requirement to defer significant amounts of revenue and the extended period over which the revenue will be recognized  along with the requirement to amortize the prepaid license discount and certain deferred development costs over an extended period of time  revenue recognized and cost of sales may be materially different from cash flows 
on an overall basis  the company s reported revenues can differ significantly from billings and or accrued billings based on terms in agreements with customers 
the table below is presented to help explain the impact of the deferral of revenue and amortization of prepaid license discount on reported revenues  and is not meant to be a substitute for accounting or presentation requirements under us generally accepted accounting principles 
product sales development fees licensing fees and milestone payments royalties billings received and or accrued per contract terms deferred billings received and or accrued deferred revenue recognized amortization of prepaid license discount total revenue as reported valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill long lived assets  including patent rights  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
this analysis can be very subjective as the company relies upon signed distribution or license agreements with variable cash flows to substantiate the recoverability of long lived assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
in the fourth quarter of each year the company updated its long range business plan 
the company then reviewed patent costs for impairment and identified patents related to products for which there were no signed distribution or license agreements or for which no revenues or cash flows were included in the business plan 
in and the company recognized impairment charges of  and  respectively  in general and administrative expenses  which represented the gross carrying amount  net of accumulated amortization  for the identified patents 
after the impairment charge  the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of patents  which are the only intangible assets of the company subject to amortization  were  and  respectively  at december  the company s estimated aggregate patent amortization expense for the next five years is  in   in each of  and  and  in the company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
such circumstances could include  but are not limited to a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  unanticipated competition  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  or a sustained significant drop in the company s stock price 
when evaluating whether goodwill is impaired  the company compares the fair value of the minnesota operations to the carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the minnesota operations exceeds its fair value  then the amount of the impairment loss must be measured 
the impairment loss would be calculated by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount 
in calculating the implied fair value of goodwill  the fair value of the minnesota operations would be allocated to all of its other assets and liabilities based on their fair values 
the excess of the fair value of the minnesota operations over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the company s evaluation of goodwill completed during  and resulted in no impairment losses 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues total revenue was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in was spread among all revenue categories  but was primarily due to increases in licensing revenue and product sales 
the licensing revenue increase was mainly due to  received under a sublicense arrangement related to an existing license agreement with biosante pharmaceuticals  inc the increase in product sales was mainly due to an increase in sales to the company s major customer  ferring 
the decrease in resulted primarily from reductions in product sales to ferring and reductions in licensing revenue  which was mainly due to the extension of revenue recognition periods of certain development and license agreements  resulting in the recognition of remaining deferred revenue over longer periods 
product sales include sales of reusable needle free injector devices  related parts  disposable components  and repairs 
in  and  revenue from sales of needle free injector devices totaled   and  respectively 
sales of disposable components in  and totaled   and  respectively 
the increase in device and disposable revenue in compared to was due mainly to an increase in sales to ferring 
this increase followed two years of decreasing sales that occurred while ferring was working down high inventory levels they had accumulated in prior years 
development revenue was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in was attributable to projects related to injector systems and transdermal gel technologies  but resulted primarily from one agreement related to use of the company s proprietary atd gel technology 
in the company also generated development fees of approximately  in connection with an agreement related to its oral fast melting tablet technology  all of which was deferred and is expected to be recognized as revenue in in approximately half of the development revenue was generated from projects related to injector devices  with most of this coming from one time projects 
the remainder of the recognized development revenue in and substantially all of the recognized development revenue in was generated under licensing and development agreements related to use of the company s transdermal gel technology 
the company also generated development fees of approximately  in under a device development agreement  substantially all of which was deferred and is being recognized over the life of the associated agreement 
licensing revenue was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to  received under a sublicense arrangement related to an existing license agreement with biosante pharmaceuticals  inc in november biosante entered into a marketing agreement with bradley pharmaceuticals  inc for elestrin formerly bio e gel 
biosante received an upfront payment from bradley which triggered a payment to the company of  in december the fda approved for marketing elestrin in the united states triggering payments to the company totaling million  which will be received in in addition  the company will receive royalties on sales of elestrin as well as potential sales based milestone payments when marketed by bradley 
the decrease in compared to was primarily the result of a decrease in deferred revenue recognized due to an increase in the revenue recognition periods of two projects following an extension of the estimated project end dates 
royalty revenue was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
royalty revenue has all been related to the vision reusable needle free injection device  and has been generated primarily under the license agreement with ferring dated january   described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
royalties from ferring are earned on device sales and in and additional royalties were earned under a provision in the ferring agreement triggered by the achievement of certain quality standards 
the increase in was due to increases both in royalties earned from device sales and in the royalty earned under the quality standards provision 
even though device sales decreased in compared to  the royalty revenue from ferring increased  which was mainly due to royalties earned under the quality standards provision 
royalties under the quality standards provision were not earned in cost of revenues the costs of product sales are primarily related to reusable injection devices and disposable components 
cost of sales as a percentage of product sales were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in was due to a combination of factors including a change in the mix of products sold and a higher sales volume absorbing a slightly decreased level of fixed overhead costs 
the cost of development revenue consists of labor costs  direct external costs and an allocation of certain overhead expenses based on actual costs and time spent in these revenue generating activities 
cost of development revenue as a percentage of development revenue can fluctuate considerably between periods depending on the development projects in process 
in some cases development projects are substantially labor based  resulting in relatively high margins  while in other cases development projects include a significant amount of external cost passed through to the customer at little or no markup  resulting in lower margins 
cost of development revenue as a percentage of development revenue was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the percentage was slightly higher than and due mainly to projects having more direct external costs that were billed to customers with little or no markup 
research and development research and development expenses were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the overall increase in compared to was primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation expense of approximately  the majority of research and development expenses consist of external costs for studies and analysis activities  design work and prototype development 
the portion of expenses related to device development projects increased slightly in compared to  but over of the total research and development expenses in each year were generated in connection with development projects related to transdermal gels and oral fast melt tablet products 
the increase in from was primarily due to development projects related to transdermal gels  including phase ii studies of anturol  and oral fast melt tablet products and consisted mainly of increases in external costs for studies and analysis work around platform validation and proof of concept work 
sales  marketing and business development sales  marketing and business development expenses were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in compared to was due mainly to an increase in professional services in connection with business development projects related to transdermal gels and oral fast melt tablets  along with an increase in stock based compensation expense of approximately  the increase in compared to was due to increases in clinical studies related to injector devices and increases in business development activities which most directly impacted payroll  travel and professional services 
the increases in payroll and travel expenses resulted primarily from the addition of a vice president of corporate business development in february of the professional services increase was mainly due to the utilization of consultants for various sales and marketing and business development projects 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in compared to was due primarily to an increase in stock based compensation expense of approximately  along with an increase in patent impairment charges of  the decrease in compared to was due primarily to decreases in legal expenses of  and professional services and investor relations expenses of  along with a decrease in patent impairment charges from  in to none in the patent impairment charges were recognized in connection with certain patents related to products for which there were no signed distribution or license agreements or for which no revenue or cash flows were projected in the company s long term business plan 
the impairment charges represented the gross carrying amount net of accumulated amortization for the identified patents 
other income expense other income expense  net  was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to an increase in interest income resulting from investment of the proceeds from the private placement of common stock in the first quarter of  partially offset by an increase in foreign exchange losses related mainly to the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on liabilities due in foreign currencies 
the increase in was primarily due to a reduction in interest expense in as compared to liquidity and capital resources the company has not historically generated  and does not currently generate  enough revenue to provide the cash needed to support its operations  and has continued to operate primarily by raising capital and incurring debt 
in order to better position the company to take advantage of potential growth opportunities and to fund future operations  the company raised additional capital in the first quarter of the company received net proceeds of  in a private placement of its common stock in which a total of  shares of common stock were sold at a price of per share 
in connection with the private placement  the company issued five year warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock with an exercise price of per share 
in the company also received proceeds of  in connection with warrant and stock option exercises which resulted in the issuance of  shares of common stock 
in february of the company received gross proceeds of  upon closing of the first tranche of a  credit facility  to help fund additional working capital needs 
a second tranche of  is available after september  but before december  upon certain conditions 
the per annum interest rate is equal to the sum of the yield for three year us treasury bills as quoted by bloomberg  plus basis points calculated i in the case of the first tranche  on the business day prior to the first funding date and ii in the case of the second tranche  on the business day prior to the second funding date as such term is defined in the credit agreement 
in addition  once set  the applicable interest rate for each tranche will be fixed for the applicable term 
the maturity date i with respect to the first tranche is forty two months from the first funding date and ii with respect to the second tranche is thirty six months from the second funding date 
the credit agreement contains certain covenants and provisions that affect the company  including  without limitation  covenants and provisions that restrict its ability to create or incur indebtedness subject to enumerated exceptions  restrict its ability to create or incur certain liens on its property subject to enumerated exceptions  in certain circumstances  require it to maintain  on a consolidated basis  unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of at least  in certain circumstances  restrict its ability to declare or pay any dividends on any shares of its capital stock  purchase or redeem any shares of its capital stock  return any capital to any holder of its equity securities or payment of certain bonuses  restrict its ability to make certain investments 
in connection with the credit facility  the company issued warrants to purchase a total of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of  of which  will vest on the occurrence of the drawdown of the second tranche 
the company believes that the combination of the recent debt and equity financings and projected product sales  product development  license revenues  milestone payments and royalties will provide sufficient funds to support operations for at least the next months 
during  the company believes capital expenditures may increase to over million primarily in connection with tooling and production equipment related to injection device deals 
the company does not currently have any bank credit lines 
if the company does need additional financing and is unable to obtain such financing when needed  or obtain it on favorable terms  the company may be required to curtail development of new drug technologies  limit expansion of operations or accept financing terms that are not as attractive as the company may desire 
net cash used in operating activities operating cash inflows are generated primarily from product sales  license and development fees and royalties 
operating cash outflows consist principally of expenditures for manufacturing costs  general and administrative costs  research and development projects and sales  marketing and business development activities 
net cash used in operating activities was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
this was primarily the result of net losses of   and  in  and  respectively  adjusted by noncash expenses and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
noncash expenses totaled   and  in  and  respectively 
the increase in compared to was primarily the result of an increase in noncash stock based compensation expense of nearly million  which was principally due to the adoption of sfas no 
r in the decrease in from was due mainly to decreases in patent rights impairment charges and stock based compensation expense 
stock based compensation expense in was higher due to more frequent utilization of common stock and warrants as compensation for external consultants 
in  the change in operating assets and liabilities generated cash of  this was primarily the net result of increases in accounts receivable of  and deferred revenue of  both increases reflect the increase in revenue generating activity in compared to the accounts receivable increase was due to an increase in product sales activity  royalties and development revenue near the end of as compared to in the amount received from license fees  development fees and milestone payments increased compared to  as did the portion of these payments that was deferred and is being recognized as revenue over various periods 
the change in operating assets and liabilities in generated cash of  this resulted mainly from the increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  and  respectively 
these increases were primarily due to increased research and development activities near the end of the year  particularly in connection with development projects related to transdermal gels  and increased accruals related to executive bonuses 
partially offsetting these increases was an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets  which utilized cash of  and a decrease in deferred revenue of  the increase in prepaid expenses and other assets was almost entirely due to payments made in connection with development projects related to transdermal gels 
the reduction in deferred revenue was the result of recognizing as revenue amounts that had previously been deferred  which exceeded amounts deferred during the year totaling approximately  the change in operating assets and liabilities in utilized cash of  this resulted primarily from decreases in deferred revenue and accrued expenses of  and  respectively  plus an increase in other assets of  partially offset by decreases in accounts and other receivables of  and inventory of  and an increase in accounts payable of  the decrease in deferred revenue was mainly due to the amortization of amounts deferred in prior years  partially offset by approximately  of development fees deferred during the year 
related to the development fees deferred in were deferred costs that totaled approximately  which is the primary reason other assets increased 
receivables decreased at the end of compared to mainly due to a reduction in billable development activity at the antares switzerland operations 
the decrease in inventory is mainly the result of the timing of purchases of finished goods from the third party supplier versus shipments to customers 
at the end of the company had a large amount of finished goods in inventory that was shipped to a customer in early january the increase in accounts payable in compared to was mainly due to an increase in operating expense activity at the end of compared to  particularly in the areas of research and development and business development 
net cash provided by used in investing activities investing activities are comprised primarily of short term investment purchases and maturities 
all short term investments are commercial paper or us government agency discount notes that mature within six to ten months of purchase and are classified as held to maturity because the company has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity 
in and the use of cash to purchase securities exceeded cash generated from maturities by  and  respectively  due to the investment of excess funds from the private placements in each of those years 
in  maturities exceeded purchases by  as cash was required to fund operations and was not available for reinvestment 
investing activities in  and also included additions to patent rights of   and  respectively  and purchases of equipment  furniture and fixtures of   and  respectively 
the purchases consisted primarily of furniture and office equipment in connection with the move of the minnesota operations to new office and laboratory space  new disposable component tooling  and upgrades to computer hardware and software

new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
sfas no 
r is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and its related implementation guidance 
among other items  the standard requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations 
sfas no 
r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services through share based payment transactions 
as of january   the company adopted the fair value method of accounting for employee stock compensation cost pursuant to sfas no 
r  which requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant 
the cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award 
prior to january   the company used the intrinsic value method under apb opinion no 
accordingly  compensation expense was recognized for restricted stock granted to employees  but was not recognized for employee stock options other than the intrinsic value of options when the exercise price of the options was below their fair value on the date of grant 
the company is using the modified prospective transition method in implementing sfas no 
r 
under that transition method  compensation cost recognized in includes compensation cost for all stock based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december   based on the grant date fair value calculated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 and compensation cost for all stock based payments granted subsequent to december   based on the grant date fair value calculated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  results for prior periods have not been restated and do not include the impact of sfas no 
r 
as a result of adopting sfas no 
r  the company s net loss for the year ended december  was approximately  more than if it had continued to account for stock based compensation under apb opinion no 
note to the consolidated financial statements contains pro forma disclosures regarding the effect on net loss and net loss per share as if the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation had been applied in the two years prior to adoption 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
it also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
this interpretation is effective beginning in fiscal year the company does not believe the implementation of this standard will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and for interim periods within those years 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands the related disclosure requirements 
the company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this statement on the consolidated financial statements 
in september  the staff of the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab no 
provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of determining whether the current year s financial statements are materially misstated 
sab no 
is effective for fiscal years ending after november  this bulletin did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure is foreign exchange rate fluctuations of the swiss franc to the us dollar as the financial position and operating results of the company s subsidiaries in switzerland are translated into us dollars for consolidation 
the company s exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations also arises from transferring funds to its swiss subsidiaries in swiss francs 
most of the company s sales and licensing fees are denominated in us dollars  thereby significantly mitigating the risk of exchange rate fluctuations on trade receivables 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the company s financial results for the years ended december   and was not material 
beginning in the company also has exposure to exchange rate fluctuations between the euro and the us dollar 
the licensing agreement entered into in january with ferring  discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  established pricing in euros for products sold under the existing supply agreement and for all royalties 
in march the company amended the agreement with ferring to principally establish prices in us dollars rather than euros 
the company does not currently use derivative financial instruments to hedge against exchange rate risk 
because exposure increases as intercompany balances grow  the company will continue to evaluate the need to initiate hedging programs to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany balances 
typically  our short term investments are commercial paper or us government agency discount notes that mature within six to ten months of purchase 
the market value of such investments fluctuates with current market interest rates 
in general  as rates increase  the market value of a debt instrument is expected to decrease 
the opposite is also true 
to minimize such market risk  we have in the past and to the extent possible  will continue in the future  to hold such debt instruments to maturity at which time the debt instrument will be redeemed at its stated or face value 
due to the short duration and nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio
