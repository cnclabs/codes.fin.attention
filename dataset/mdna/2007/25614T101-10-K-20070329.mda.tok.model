item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we realized a stabilization of losses despite significant increases in the size and scope of our organization that were made in order to execute our business strategies which we believe will continue to drive revenue growth toward profitable levels in or in addition  the receipt of approximately  in deferred revenues  while not reflected in operating income in  significantly improved our operating cash flows during the second half of while operating cash flows were positive in the second half of  we used cash for operations  the financing of our acquisition of p and for certain patent defense costs throughout we offset these uses of cash through the sale of its equity to warrant holders and to private placement investors  which in the aggregate raised approximately million during we had cash on hand of approximately million as of december  on august   dss filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the european court of first instance against the ecb alleging that the euro banknotes produced by the ecb infringe the patent 
the ecb contended that the proper venue was not in the european court of first instance  but rather in each individual country that is a member of the ecb 
on march   dss received notice that the ecb had filed separate lawsuits in the united kingdom and luxembourg patent courts seeking the invalidation of the patent 
claims to invalidity of the patent  largely in the same form  were subsequently served in the netherlands  germany  austria  italy  spain  belgium and france 
the parties are still awaiting the ruling from the european court of first instance on the issue of venue 
we have been advised that the ecb must win invalidity rulings in nine countries in order to achieve a complete invalidation of the patent and to stop the infringement suit from moving forward 
on march   the high court of justice  chancery division  patents court in london  england issued its decision in the patent invalidity lawsuit brought by the european central bank the ecb against us 
the english court ruled that european patent no b the patent  that was awarded to us by the european patent office technical board of appeal  has been deemed invalid in the united kingdom 
on march   the german federal patent court bundespatentgericht in munich  germany  ruled that the patent is valid in germany 
the court decisions do not affect the validity of the patent in other european countries 
the ruling in germany  finding that the patent is valid  is therefore significant because it validates the legal basis of the company s infringement suit aginst the ecb

our core products  technology and services our core business is counterfeit prevention  brand protection and validation of authentic print media  including government issued documents  currency  private corporate records  securities and more 
we are a leader in the research and development of optical security technologies and have commercialized these technologies with a broad suite of products that offer our customers a wide array of document security solutions that satisfy their specific anti counterfeiting requirements 
we provide document security technology to security printers  corporations and governments worldwide 
our technology can be used in securing sensitive and critical documents such as currency  automobile titles  spare parts forms for the aerospace industry  gift certificates  permits  checks  licenses  receipts  prescription and medical forms  engineering schematics  id cards  labels  original music  coupons  homeland security manuals  consumer product and pharmaceutical packaging  tickets  and school transcripts 
in addition  we have developed an on demand tm product to implement our technologies in internet based environments utilizing standard desktop printers 
we believe that our on demand technology greatly expands the reach and potential market for our technologies and solutions 
technologies we have developed or acquired over technologies that provide to our customers a wide spectrum of solutions 
our primary anti counterfeiting products and technologies are marketed under the following trade names authentiguard on demand  delivered through customized software or a web based application  makes the verification feature of authentiguard prism and the anti copy anti scan features of pantograph printable from desktop printers and digital presses worldwide 
authentiguard on demand provides the ability to produce highly secure documents virtually any time  anywhere  and is highly effective in variable data applications 
the on demand solution eliminates the requirement to utilize pre printed forms while allowing customers to leverage existing investments in their information technology infrastructure 
authentiguard laser moir identifies counterfeit reproductions by using patented technology to create gross distortions and unmistakable moir interference patterns throughout the image 
verification of original documents or images is fast and easy with the authenticator our proprietary lens that reveals the moir pattern 
the technology is embedded into an image that requires protection from duplication and theft  such as photographs  portraits  currency  driver s licenses  postage stamps  tickets  labels  brand packaging  or documents 
authentiguard prism uses our patent pending technology to embed hidden words  images  or logos using color or color processes that are only visible using the authenticator our proprietary lens that reveals hidden prism images 
we believe that the customizable  hidden words  images or logos embedded with the prism technology cannot be reproduced with even the most sophisticated digital copiers or scanners 
as a result  the absence of the hidden words  images or logos alerts the end user that the document is counterfeit 
the prism technology protects verification forms such as spare parts  packing slips  checks  currency  licenses  travelers checks  postage stamps  legal documents  tickets  labels  brand packaging  any full color images such as art prints or color pictures  and more 
authentiguard pantograph provides what we believe is one of the most powerful  patent pending pantograph technology ever created 
hidden words such as void or copy  company logos  or designs appear when a document utilizing the technology is photocopied or scanned  preventing unauthorized duplication 
although there are other versions of this technology being sold by competitors  we believe that no version other then our pantograph defeats high and low resolution scanners  produces clear and readable warning words 
in addition  we believe that we have the only security paper that defeats today s generation of digital scanning copiers 
virtually any printable surface can utilize the technology such as paper text and cover  teslin  pvc  tyvek and cardboard packaging 
this technology has been used for gift certificates  school transcripts  coupons  tickets  checks  packing slips  receipts  schematic drawings  plans  music  scripts  training manuals  business plans  internal memos  letterhead  legal forms and prescription pads 
authentiguard survivor protects printed checks from duplication via digital copiers and scanners while providing a patent pending security feature that survives the background dropout that results from bank s archival scan 
survivor was created to meet new government banking regulations that needed a solution that would make documents archive scan friendly  without compromising security 
authentiguard obscurascan  sometimes called color separation multiplier  protects against the counterfeiting of any process color document  package  image or label 
a hidden technology is embedded into the document that severely alters images so that printing plates or digital color separations for the four color process are distorted by substantially increasing the density of the primary colors making it nearly impossible to recreate a useable color image 
when a counterfeit is attempted on a document using this technology  the output is a muddy  dark unusable blend of colors 
this technology also produces chattering wavy lines  causing additional distortion of the image 
authentiguard block out  also called the anti color reproduction system  makes it very difficult to reproduce protected documents on digital color copiers 
certain copiers recognize block out s embedded graphics on the original document  and print out solid color sheets or highly distorted images 
block out uses a unique proprietary graphic design that we developed that prevents color copiers and photo processors from replicating any image or document that contains our custom block out graphics 
this technology can be integrated into highly sensitive government documents such as currency  car titles  passports and licenses as well as checks  travelers checks  postage stamps  photographs  original art and brand packaging 
authentiguard microperf is an optical variable technology  or ovt  that creates a verifier mark that is invisible to the naked eye when viewed under normal circumstances and unnoticeable to the touch 
microperf uses a laser to insert fine perforations into the document  which can be viewed by holding the document up to a normal light for fast and easy authentication 
this technology can be placed on vital records  documents  packaging or currency and is a micro sized perforation in the shape of a word or image that cannot be removed or altered 
we believe our patented microperf could also potentially replace or be used in conjunction with holographs on currency since the perforations created by microperf pass the currency crush tests and are a much more controlled technology than the world wide availability of holographs 
authentiguard phantom uses tilt to reveal hidden images or words that can be viewed without special equipment 
viewed straight on  the hidden images are invisible to the naked eye  but when the package or document is viewed at an angle  the hidden images are clearly revealed 
for added security  we believe that our patented phantom technology cannot be reproduced by virtually any copier or scanner 
authentiguard veriglow is a two tiered  customized document security system that utilizes unique photosensitive inks and incorporates embedded hidden messages or images that are only viewable with a special light source and the authenticator our proprietary lens 
this patent pending technology can be applied during the printing process or it can be applied to pre printed items and is useful in the protection of vital records  documents  brand protection  packaging  currency  and more 
products and services custom document security solutions and production our technology portfolio allows us to create unique custom secure paper  plastic  packaging and internet based solutions 
we target end users that require anti counterfeiting and authentication features in a wide range of printed materials such as documents  vital records  driver s licenses  birth certificates  receipts  manuals  identification materials  entertainment tickets  coupons  parts tracking forms  as well as product packaging including pharmaceutical and a wide range of consumer goods 
currently  we outsource the production of the majority of our custom security print orders to strategic printing vendors  except for secure plastic printed documents such as id cards  which are manufactured internally at our p division 
the acquisition of p in february marked the initial execution of our strategy to expand our manufacturing capabilities through acquisitions  partnerships or strategic alliances in order to fully service our custom security printing business 
our p division generally charges a per unit fee for its printing projects 
custom projects are generally billed at cost plus mark up 
additionally  our custom security solutions include our on demand technology that provides custom hosted or server based solutions for our customers 
depending on our customer s specific requirements  we host a secure server that accepts user inputs and delivers custom  variable secure documents for output at the user location  or offer a bundled server solution that allows for the production of custom  variable secure documents within the user s network environment 
for these projects  we typically charge the client a project fee along with ongoing licenses and maintenance fees 
we also anticipate that we will be entering into per usage fee arrangements for certain applications of the on demand solution 
security paper our primary product for the retail end user market is authentiguard security paper  which uses our pantograph technology 
it is a paper that reveals hidden warning words  logos or images using the authenticator our proprietary viewing lens or when the paper is faxed  copied  scanned or re imaged in any form 
the hidden words appear on the duplicate or the computer digital file and essentially prevents important documents from being counterfeited 
we market and sell our security paper primarily through two major paper distributors boise cascade and paperlinx limited 
since  boise has marketed our security paper under its boise beware brand name in north america  primarily through its commercial paper sales group  and in officemax and copymax stores 
in late  we entered into an agreement with paperlinx to market and sell our security paper under the name securelinx in europe  australia and new zealand 
in addition  our licensee pyrotech has the marketing rights to manufacture and sell our security paper in the continent of africa 
we retain the rights to sell the same security paper directly to end users anywhere in the world 
currently  our security paper is manufactured and stored for us by a third party printer  which we believe has sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet the foreseeable demand for this product 
technology licensing we license our anti counterfeiting technology and trade secrets through licensing arrangements with security printers 
we seek licensees that have a broad customer base that can benefit from our technologies or have unique and strategic capabilities that expand the capabilities that we can offer our potential customers 
revenue from licensing can take several forms 
licenses can be for a single technology or for a package of technologies 
licensees can choose from a variety of payment models  such as pay one price per year licensees estimate their annual usage and a single payment is paid and reviewed each year based on actual results 
pay a percentage of sales of the technology licensees only pay as they sell product containing the technology 
pay on a per piece method licensees pay royalties based on a price per piece 
a pre determined price schedule is implemented based on job volumes and a per piece price is utilized 
typically  the higher the volume  the lower the price per piece 
joint venture licensing profit sharing arrangement with clients where we share the net profit of all products sold containing our technologies 
legal products we also own and operate legalstore 
com  an internet company which sells legal supplies and documents  including security paper and products for the users of legal documents and supplies in the legal  medical and educational fields 
while not a component of our core business strategy  we seek to maximize the revenue and profitability of this operation 
patents and trademarks patents our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology  products and manufacturing processes 
we principally rely upon patent  trademark  trade secrets and contract law to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
during the early stages of our development  we have expended a significant percentage of our resources on the research and development to ensure that we are a market leader the ability to provide our customers effective solutions against an ever changing array of counterfeit risks 
during  and  we spent   and  of our revenue  respectively  for our research and development efforts 
based on these efforts  we currently have over a dozen formal patent applications pending  including provisional and pct patent applications and applications that have entered the national phase in various countries including the united states  canada  europe  japan  brazil  mexico  indonesia and south africa 
these applications cover our technologies  including our authentiguard on demand  authentiguard prism  authentiguard obscurascan  authentiguard survivor  authentiguard veriglow products  and several other anti counterfeiting and authentication technologies in development 
as we continue to grow our business  we expect to expand our research and development efforts  although these costs are expected to continue to decrease as a percentage of our revenue 
it is our ongoing policy of filing patent applications to seek protection for novel features of our products 
we believe that our patents are important to both our anti counterfeiting and verification businesses 
as of december   the remaining legal lives of our patents ranged from approximately years to years 
in addition to our current patent activities  we own several patents that we acquired in when we acquired companies owned by various members of the wicker family and the estate of ralph wicker  including us patents  european patent  canadian patent  and a ownership of us patent no  collectively  the wicker patents 
however  due to previous contractual agreements associated with the wicker patents  we did not obtain certain economic rights to these patents in  including certain economic rights to benefits derived from settlements  licenses or other subsequent business arrangements from any person or entity that had been proven to infringe these patents 
therefore  to consolidate our ownership and economic rights to the wicker patents  we entered into the following transactions 
in  we entered into an agreement with the estate of ralph wicker and its assigns to purchase from them the right to of the future economic benefit derived from settlements  licenses or subsequent business arrangements from any infringer of the wicker patents that we choose to pursue  with the estate of ralph wicker receiving the remaining of such economic benefit 
in february  we further consolidated our ownership of the wicker patents by purchasing the economic interests and ownership from the persons and entities that had purchased various rights in wicker family technologies  including the wicker patents 
as a result of this transaction  we increased our ownership of us patent  to  and increased to our right to future economic benefits to the wicker patents to approximately of all settlements or license royalties derived from  among other things  infringement suits related to the foreign wicker patents  including european patent we also jointly have the rights to us patent no 
 with us donnelly 
under the terms of our agreement with rr donnelly  it has no rights in any revenue generated by us through the technology represented by the patent 
rr donnelly may license the technology but is required to equally divide any revenue with us after costs associated with any licensing 
rr donnelly has recently renewed its license from us to the technology related to patent  for several years 
we also own us patent no 
 and  related to embossed document protection methods and products and tamper and copy protected documents  respectively 
by aggressively defending our intellectual property rights  we believe that we may be able to secure a potentially significant amount of additional and ongoing revenue by securing licensing agreements with those persons  companies or governments that we believe are infringing our patents 
we intend to use all legal means to protect our ownership of these technologies 
we have been and expect to continue to be very aggressive in our patent protection efforts 
we cannot be assured that our efforts to prevent the misappropriation of the intellectual property used in our business will be successful 
further  we cannot be assured that any patents will be issued for our us or foreign applications or that  if issued  they will provide protection against competitive technologies or will be held valid and enforceable if challenged 
finally  we cannot be assured that competitors would not be able to design around any such proprietary right or obtain rights that we would need to license or design around in order to practice under these patents 
trademarks we have registered our authentiguard trademark  as well as our survivor electronic check icon with the us patent and trademark office 
a trademark application is pending in canada for authentiguard 
authentiguard is registered in several european countries including the united kingdom 
sales and marketing we believe that was a year in which we completed our early development stage and entered the growth and commercialization phase of business 
in  we began to see the results of our efforts of building our brand  and identifying strategic partners and customers upon which to grow our business 
as we entered this new phase of our business  we increased our sales and marketing expenditures in order to facilitate our expected growth 
in  we focused on sales activities associated with the commercialization of our products  with both established and new customers and partners  and also defined opportunities to expand our products and our channels to market 
we also created a new vertical market strategy to help support these efforts with a focus on five primary verticals were our focused academic higher education  financial institutions  government government agencies  genuine parts manufacturers  and healthcare pharmaceutical 
we believe that these industries provide the largest revenue potential and opportunities for our technology and product solutions 
we also began the expansion and reorganization of our sales and marketing staff and programs  which we believe is necessary to continue to grow our business  drive revenue  and create ongoing brand and name recognition 
we expect to see the positive results of these initiatives throughout our marketing activities are focused on developing brand awareness of authentiguard  our technology suite brand 
additionally  we plan on opening new sales and marketing offices in washington  dc and manhattan  new york  realigning and growing our sales team to support our new vertical targets  and continuing our research and develop of new products and technologies  with a continued focus on enhancing and developing our on demand product 
no single customer accounted for or more of our total revenue or one of our segment s revenue for the year ended december  at december   one customer accounted for and one customer accounted for of our trade accounts receivable balance 
in  the company derived of its document security revenue of total revenue from one customer  of which  was in accounts receivable of total as of december  international revenue  which consists of sales to customers with operations in western europe  latin america  africa  middle east and asia  comprised of total revenue for each of  and less than of total revenue for and  respectively 
revenue is allocated to individual countries by customer based on where the product is shipped or the location of services performed 
we had no long lived assets in any country other than the united states for any period presented 
websites we maintain www

competition currently  the security print market is comprised of a few very large companies and an increasing number of small companies with specific technology niches 
the expansion of this market is the result of increasing requirements for national security  as well as the proliferation of brand and identity theft 
counterfeiting has expanded significantly as advancing technologies in digital duplication and scanning combined with increasingly sophisticated design software has enabled easier reproduction of originals 
our industry is highly fragmented and characterized by rapid technological change and product innovations and evolving standards 
our competitors include standard register company  which specializes in printing security technologies for the check and forms and medical industries  de la rue plc  that specializes in printing secure currency  tickets  labels  lottery tickets and vital records for governments and fortune companies  xerox  an industry leader in copying and scanning that has made recent entries into the anti counterfeiting arena and has a competing safety paper product called x void 
our p id card manufacturing operation competes with lasercard corporation which supplies advanced id technology to the us federal government and other government programs worldwide 
other competing hidden word technologies that are being marketed by competitors  such as nocopi technologies which sells and markets secure paper products and graphic security systems corporation  which markets scrambled indicia 
digital watermarks  rfid and biometric technologies are also being introduced into the marketplace by digimarc corporation  ibm and l identity solutions 
these digital protection systems require software and hardware such as scanners and computers to implement and utilize the technology and  consequently  this technology must be utilized in a controlled environment with the necessary equipment to create the verification process 
large office equipment manufacturers  called oems  such as sharp  canon  ricoh  hewlett packard and eastman kodak are developing smart copier technology that recognizes particular graphical images and produces warning words or distorted copies 
some of the oems are also developing user assigned and variable pantograph hidden word technologies in which users can assign a particular hidden work in copy  such as void that is displayed when copy of such document is made 
segment information we operate through two segments s document security and production 
this segment licenses  manufactures and sells document security technologies and secure printed products in our document security systems  plastic printing professionals and patrick printing divisions 
this segment also includes revenues from copying services and residual royalties from past motion picture operations 
s legal supplies 
this segment sells legal supplies to lawyers and law firms via legalstore 
com 
financial information regarding these segments is provided in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
financial information relating to revenues and other operating income  net loss  operating expenses and total assets for the three years ended december   can be found in item selected financial data 
employees as of december  we had full and part time employees  two of whom are executive officers  and we have one independent consultant 
it is important that we continue to retain and attract qualified management and technical personnel 
our employees are not covered by any collective bargaining agreement  and we believe that our relations with our employees are good 
government regulation in light of the events of september  and the subsequent war on terrorism  governments  private entities and individuals have become more aware of  and concerned with  the problems related with counterfeit documents 
homeland security remains a high priority in the united states 
this new heightened awareness may result in new laws or regulations which could impact our business 
we believe  however  that any such laws or regulations would be aimed at requiring or promoting anti counterfeiting  and therefore would likely have a positive impact on our business plans 
item a risk factors an investment in our securities is subject to numerous risks  including the risk factors described below 
our business  operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks 
the risks described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks we are not presently aware of or that we currently believe are immaterial may also materially affect our business 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks 
in assessing these risks  you should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this form k  including our financial statements and related notes 
we have a limited operating history with our business model  which limits the information available to you to evaluate our business 
since our inception in  we have accumulated deficits from historical operations of approximately  at december  in  we changed our business model and chose to strategically focus on becoming a developer and marketer of secure technologies for all forms of print media 
we have continued to incur losses since we began our new business model 
also  we have limited operating and financial information relating to this new business to evaluate our performance and future prospects 
due to the change in our business model  we do not view our historical financials as being a good indication of our future 
we face the risks and difficulties of a company going into a new business including the uncertainties of market acceptance  competition  cost increases and delays in achieving business objectives 
there can be no assurance that we will succeed in addressing any or all of these risks  and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
if we lose our current litigation  we may lose certain of our technology rights which may affect our business plan 
we are subject to litigation and alleged litigation  including our litigation with the european central bank  in which parties allege  among other things  that certain of our patents are invalid 
one of our patents that is subject to the litigation against the european central bank has been ruled invalid in the united kingdom but has subsequently been ruled valid in germany 
for more information regarding this litigation  see item legal proceedings 
if the ecb or other parties are successful in invalidating any or all of our patents  it may materially affect us  our financial condition  and our ability to market and sell certain technology 
if we lose our current infringement litigation we may be liable for significant legal costs of our counterparts 
we have been able to mitigate the cash outlays that we have been required to make for legal costs of our current infringement litigation and related invalidity cases against the european central bank by  among other things  negotiating legal fee caps and using shares of our common stock for payments 
as noted above  on march   the high court of justice  chancery division  patents court in london  england issued its decision in the patent invalidity lawsuit brought by the european central bank the ecb against us 
the english court ruled that european patent no b the patent  that was awarded to us by the european patent office technical board of appeal  has been deemed invalid in the united kingdom 
we may be required to pay a portion of the ecb s legal costs associated with the united kingdom invalidity lawsuit  which will be determined by the court after a hearing 
as of the date of this k  the ecb has listed approximately  approximately million of applicable costs  of which no more than is typically eligible for reimbursement by the company 
if we receive further adverse rulings in any of our infringement or related invalidity cases against the european central bank  we will likely be responsible for a large portion of the legal costs that were expended by the european central bank in such case  which would likely be significant 
the payment of these amounts could adversely affect the company s financial position 
if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property  our competitive advantage may disappear 
our success will be determined in part by our ability to obtain united states and foreign patent protection for our technology and to preserve our trade secrets 
because of the substantial length of time and expense associated with developing new document security technology  we place considerable importance on patent and trade secret protection 
we intend to continue to rely primarily on a combination of patent protection  trade secrets  technical measures  copyright protection and nondisclosure agreements with our employees and customers to establish and protect the ideas  concepts and documentation of software and trade secrets developed by us 
our ability to compete and the ability of our business to grow could suffer if these intellectual property rights are not adequately protected 
there can be no assurance that our patent applications will result in patents being issued or that current or additional patents will afford protection against competitors 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks and trade secret protection and contractual rights to establish and protect our intellectual property 
failure of our patents  copyrights  trademarks and trade secret protection  non disclosure agreements and other measures to provide protection of our technology and our intellectual property rights could enable our competitors to more effectively compete with us and have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  our trade secrets and proprietary know how may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by others 
no guarantee can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or techniques  or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technology 
in addition  we may be required to litigate in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
any such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations  and there can be no assurances of the success of any such litigation 
we may face intellectual property infringement or other claims against us  our customers or our intellectual property that could be costly to defend and result in our loss of significant rights 
although we have received us patents and a european patent with respect to certain technologies of ours  there can be no assurance that these patents will afford us any meaningful protection 
although we believe that our use of the technology and products we developed and other trade secrets used in our operations do not infringe upon the rights of others  our use of the technology and trade secrets we developed may infringe upon the patents or intellectual property rights of others 
in the event of infringement  we could  under certain circumstances  be required to obtain a license or modify aspects of the technology and trade secrets we developed or refrain from using same 
we may not have the necessary financial resources to defend an infringement claim made against us or be able to successfully terminate any infringement in a timely manner  upon acceptable terms and conditions or at all 
failure to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition 
moreover  if the patents  technology or trade secrets we developed or use in our business are deemed to infringe upon the rights of others  we could  under certain circumstances  become liable for damages  which could have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition 
as we continue to market our products  we could encounter patent barriers that are not known today 
a patent search will not disclose applications that are currently pending in the united states patent office  and there may be one or more such pending applications that would take precedence over any or all of our applications 
furthermore  third parties may assert that our intellectual property rights are invalid  which could result in significant expenditures by us to refute such assertions 
if we become involved in litigation  we could lose our proprietary rights  be subject to damages and incur substantial unexpected operating expenses 
intellectual property litigation is expensive and time consuming  even if the claims are subsequently proven unfounded  and could divert management s attention from our business 
if there is a successful claim of infringement  we may not be able to develop non infringing technology or enter into royalty or license agreements on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unsuccessful in defending claims that our intellectual property rights are invalid  we may not be able to enter into royalty or license agreements on acceptable terms  if at all 
this could prohibit us from providing our products and services to customers  which could have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition 
if our products and services do not achieve market acceptance  we may not achieve our revenue and net income goals in the time prescribed or at all 
we are at the early stage of introducing our document security technology and products to the market 
if we are unable to operate our business as contemplated by our business model or if the assumptions underlying our business model prove to be unfounded  we could fail to achieve our revenue and net income goals within the time we have projected  or at all  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
as a result  the value of your investment could be significantly reduced or completely lost 
we cannot assure you that a sufficient number of such companies will demand our products or services or other document security products 
in addition  we cannot predict the rate of market s acceptance of our document security solutions 
failure to maintain a significant customer base may have a material adverse effect on our business 
the results of our research and development efforts are uncertain and there can be no assurance of the commercial success of our products 
we believe that we will need to continue to incur research and development expenditures to remain competitive 
the products we currently are developing or may develop in the future may not be technologically successful 
in addition  the length of our product development cycle may be greater than we originally expect and we may experience delays in future product development 
if our resulting products are not technologically successful  they may not achieve market acceptance or compete effectively with our competitors products 
changes in document security technology and standards could render our applications and services obsolete 
the market for document security products  applications  and services is fast moving and evolving 
identification and authentication technology is constantly changing as we and our competitors introduce new products  applications  and services  and retire old ones as customer requirements quickly develop and change 
in addition  the standards for document security are continuing to evolve 
if any segments of our market adopt technologies or standards that are inconsistent with our applications and technology  sales to those market segments could decline  which could have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition 
the market in which we operate is highly competitive  and we may not be able to compete effectively  especially against established industry competitors with greater market presence and financial resources 
our market is highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change and product innovations 
our competitors may have advantages over us because of their longer operating histories  more established products  greater name recognition  larger customer bases  and greater financial  technical and marketing resources 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  and devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products 
competition may also force us to decrease the price of our products and services 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing and introducing new technology on a timely basis  new products with enhanced features  or that these products  if introduced  will enable us to establish selling prices and gross margins at profitable levels 
our growth strategy depends  in part  on our acquiring complementary businesses and assets and expanding our existing operations to include manufacturing capabilities  which we may be unable to do 
our growth strategy is based  in part  on our ability to acquire businesses and assets that are complimentary to our existing operations and expanding our operations to include manufacturing capabilities 
we may also seek to acquire other businesses 
the success of this acquisition strategy will depend  in part  on our ability to accomplish the following identify suitable businesses or assets to buy  complete the purchase of those businesses on terms acceptable to us  complete the acquisition in the time frame we expect  and improve the results of operations of the businesses that we buy and successfully integrate their operations into our own 
although we were able to successfully acquire our p subsidiary in february  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in pursuing any or all of these steps on future transactions 
our failure to implement our acquisition strategy could have an adverse effect on other aspects of our business strategy and our business in general 
we may not be able to find appropriate acquisition candidates  acquire those candidates that we find or integrate acquired businesses effectively or profitably 
our acquisition program and strategy may lead us to contemplate acquisitions of companies in bankruptcy  which entail additional risks and uncertainties 
such risks and uncertainties include  without limitation  that  before assets may be acquired  customers may leave in search of more stable providers and vendors may terminate key relationships 
also  assets are generally acquired on an as is basis  with no recourse to the seller if the assets are not as valuable as may be represented 
finally  while bankrupt companies may be acquired for comparatively little money  the cost of continuing the operations may significantly exceed expectations 
we have in the past used  and may continue to use  our common stock as payment for all or a portion of the purchase price for acquisitions 
if we issue significant amounts of our common stock for such acquisitions  this could result in substantial dilution of the equity interests of our stockholders 
if we fail to retain our key personnel and attract and retain additional qualified personnel  we might not be able to pursue our growth strategy 
our future success depends upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key sales and research personnel who possess longstanding industry relationships and technical knowledge of our products and operations 
the loss of any of our key employees  in particular  patrick white  our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  peter ettinger  our president  thomas wicker  our vice president of research and development  and david wicker  our vice president of operations  could negatively impact our ability to pursue our growth strategy and conduct operations 
although we believe that our relationship with these individuals is positive  there can be no assurance that the services of these individuals will continue to be available to us in the future 
we have extended our employment agreements with patrick white to june our employment agreements with thomas wicker and david wicker expire in june our employment agreement with peter ettinger expires in june there can be no assurance that these persons will continue to agree to be employed by us after such dates 
if we do not successfully expand our sales force  we may be unable to increase our revenues 
we must expand the size of our marketing activities and sales force to increase revenues 
we continue to evaluate various methods of expanding our marketing activities  including the use of outside marketing consultants and representatives and expanding our in house marketing capabilities 
going forward  we anticipate an increasing percentage of our revenues to come from the licensing of our newer technologies  where profit margins are significantly higher than those provided by security paper 
if we are unable to hire or retain qualified sales personnel  if newly hired personnel fail to develop the necessary skills to be productive  or if they reach productivity more slowly than anticipated  our ability to increase our revenues and grow could be compromised 
the challenge of attracting  training and retaining qualified candidates may make it difficult to meet our sales growth targets 
further  we may not generate sufficient sales to offset the increased expense resulting from expanding our sales force or we may be unable to manage a larger sales force 
future growth in our business could make it difficult to manage our resources 
our anticipated business expansion could place a significant strain on our management  administrative and financial resources 
significant growth in our business may require us to implement additional operating  product development and financial controls  improve coordination among marketing  product development and finance functions  increase capital expenditures and hire additional personnel 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage any substantial expansion of our business  including attracting and retaining qualified personnel 
any failure to properly manage our future growth could negatively impact our business and operating results 
we cannot predict our future capital needs and we may not be able to secure additional financing 
we may need to raise additional funds in the future to fund more aggressive expansion of our business  complete the development  testing and marketing of our products  or make strategic acquisitions or investments 
we may require additional equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or funds from other sources for these purposes 
no assurance can be given that these funds will be available for us to finance our development on acceptable terms  if at all 
such additional financings may involve substantial dilution of our stockholders or may require that we relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or products 
in addition  we may experience operational difficulties and delays due to working capital restrictions 
if adequate funds are not available from operations or additional sources of financing  we may have to delay or scale back our growth plans 
risks related to our stock provisions of our certificate of incorporation and agreements could delay or prevent a change in control of our company 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation may discourage  delay  or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable 
these provisions include the authority of the board of directors to issue preferred stock  and a prohibition on cumulative voting in the election of directors 
we have a large number of authorized but unissued shares of common stock  which our management may issue without further stockholder approval  thereby causing dilution of your holdings of our common stock 
as of december   there are  million shares of authorized but unissued shares of our common stock 
our management will continue to have broad discretion to issue shares of our common stock in a range of transactions  including capital raising transactions  mergers  acquisitions  for anti takeover purposes  and in other transactions  without obtaining stockholder approval  unless stockholder approval is required for a particular transaction under the rules of the american stock exchange  new york law  or other applicable laws 
we currently have no specific plans to issue shares of our common stock for any purpose 
however  if our management determines to issue shares of our common stock from the large pool of such authorized but unissued shares for any purpose in the future without obtaining stockholder approval  your ownership position would be diluted without your further ability to vote on that transaction 
the exercise of our outstanding options and warrants and vesting of restricted stock awards may depress our stock price 
as of december   there were outstanding stock options and warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at exercise prices ranging from to per share  most of which are currently exercisable 
to the extent that these securities are exercised  dilution to our stockholders will occur 
in addition  as of december   there were  restricted shares of our common stock that are subject to various vesting terms 
to the extent that these securities vest  dilution to our stockholders will occur 
moreover  the terms upon which we will be able to obtain additional equity capital may be adversely affected  since the holders of these securities can be expected to exercise or convert them at a time when we would  in all likelihood  be able to obtain any needed capital on terms more favorable to us than the exercise and conversion terms provided by those securities 
sales of these shares in the public market  or the perception that future sales of these shares could occur  could have the effect of lowering the market price of our common stock below current levels and make it more difficult for us and our stockholders to sell our equity securities in the future 
sale or the availability for sale of shares of common stock by stockholders could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and could impair our ability to raise capital through an offering of additional equity securities 
we do not intend to pay cash dividends 
we do not intend to declare or pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
we anticipate that we will retain any earnings and other cash resources for investment in our business 
the payment of dividends on our common stock is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our operations  financial position  financial requirements  general business conditions  restrictions imposed by financing arrangements  if any  legal restrictions on the payment of dividends and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant

item legal proceedings on august   we commenced a suit against the european central bank alleging patent infringement by the european central bank and have claimed unspecified damages 
we brought the suit in european court of first instance in luxembourg 
we alleged that all euro banknotes in circulation infringe our european patent b the patent  which covers a method of incorporating an anti counterfeiting feature into banknotes or similar security documents to protect against forgeries by digital scanning and copying devices 
we will seek all remedies available to us under the law 
in november  the european central bank filed its answer to our complaint asserting mostly procedural and jurisdictional arguments 
the ecb contended that the proper venue was not in the court of first instance  but rather in each individual country that is a member of the ecb 
we responded to the european central bank s answer in late december  arguing that the court of first instance was the proper venue 
the parties are awaiting the ruling from the court of first instance 
on march   we received notice that the ecb has filed a separate claim in the united kingdom and luxembourg patent courts luxembourg being the seat of the european court of first instance seeking the invalidation of the patent 
claims to invalidity in each of the netherlands  belgium  italy  france  spain  germany and austria were subsequently served on the company 
the main basis of the ecb s claim as to invalidity is the existence of prior art 
a second basis is that the scope of the patent was extended in prosecution  which in europe is a ground of invalidity 
on january   the trial regarding the patent s validity in the united kingdom commenced in the high court of justice  chancery division  patents court in london  england and concluded on january  on march   the high court of justice  chancery division  patents court in london  england issued its decision in the patent invalidity lawsuit brought by the european central bank the ecb against us 
the english court ruled that european patent no b the patent  that was awarded to us by the european patent office technical board of appeal  has been deemed invalid in the united kingdom 
the court s decision does not affect the validity of the patent in other european countries 
we will review our options with respect to the appeal of this decision 
as a result of this ruling  the company may be liable to reimburse the ecb of a portion of the ecb s legal costs associated with the case  which the ecb has initially listed as up to  approximately million of which no more than is typically eligible for reimbursement 
the company intends to seek to limit the reimbursement based on the facts and circumstances of the case 
on march   the german federal patent court bundespatentgericht in munich  germany  ruled that the patent is valid in germany 
the ruling in germany  finding that the patent is valid  is significant because it validates the legal basis of the company s infringement suit against the ecb 
additional trials regarding validity are expected to commence in the seven other countries during and on january   we commenced an action  unrelated to the above ecb litigation  entitled new sky communications  inc  as successor in interest to thomas m 
wicker  thomas m 
wicker enterprises  inc and document security consultants v 
adler technologies  inc 
n k a adlertech international  inc and andrew mctaggert united states district court  western district of new york case no 
cv t f regarding certain intellectual property in which we have an interest 
we commenced this action alleging various causes of action against adler technologies  inc and andrew mctaggert for breach of contract  breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing  misappropriation of trade secrets  and various business torts  including unfair competiton 
adler distributes and supplies anti counterfeit currency devices and mr 
mctaggert is a principal of adler  which is a former licensee of certain of our technology 
adler had entered into several agreements with thomas m 
wicker enterprises and document security consultants  both of which we acquired in these agreements  generally  authorized adler to manufacture in canada our checkmate patented system for verifying the authenticity of currency and documents 
other agreements were entered into between the parties and thomas wicker regarding other technology owned by wicker and assigned to us including archangel  an anti copy technology  and blockade  which creates a wave pattern on documents when they are reproduced or scanned 
it is our contention  among other things  that adler has breached these agreements  failed to make an appropriate accounting and payments under these agreements  and may have exceeded the scope of its license 
adler has denied the material allegations of the complaint and has counterclaimed against our company  claiming adler owns or co owns or has a license to use certain technologies of ours  including several us patents 
in may  we filed our first amended and supplemental complaint adding blanks usa and raymond maxon as additional defendants 
in february  we filed our second amended and supplemental complaint adding judith wu mctaggart s wife and arcis digital security  inc a company in which ms 
wu is involved as additional defendants 
maxon has asserted a counterclaim against us contenting that our acquisition of certain patents and technology from thomas wicker in gave rise to an alleged right on the part of maxon to receive a portion of thomas wicker s proceeds from such acquisition 
we have denied the material allegations of all of the counterclaims 
if adler is successful  it may materially affect us  our financial condition  and our ability to market and sell certain of our technology and related products 
this case is in discovery phase  and it is too soon to determine how the various issues raised by the lawsuit will be determined 
in addition to the foregoing  we are subject to other legal proceedings that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not been finally adjudicated 
although there can be no assurance in this regard  in the opinion of management  none of the legal proceedings to which we are a party  whether discussed herein or otherwise  will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows or our financial condition

overview prior to  the company considered itself an early stage company and focused a significant amount of its resources to developing its product portfolio  assembling its key personnel and workforce  developing a research and development function and pursuing and consolidating ownership of it patented technology 
in addition  the company during this early stage expended a significant amount of time and resources in pursuing legal recourses against potential infringers of its technologies 
during this period  the company experienced operating losses and negative cashflows associated with its operating losses and its investments in its long term assets 
to date  the company has been able to offset a significant amount of its cash requirements by paying for services and acquiring patent and other assets with its equity or a combination of equity and cash 
during  the company made significant strides in the execution of its business growth strategies 
the company believes that was the first year that it was able to focus primarily on the marketing and selling of its unique and powerful technologies to a wide audience 
prior to  the company primarily concentrated its sales and marketing efforts on licensing its technology to security printers  and developing a line of pre packaged safety paper for the retail markets 
while these efforts produced some significant customer relationships  most notably with rr donnelley  boise cascade and paperlinx ltd  the company determined that a far larger potential customer base was not being addressed 
as a result  in late  the company shifted its focus to increase its internal sales and marketing resources  increase its production capabilities and target specific vertical markets 
in addition  during  the company s research and development team developed a new technology that allows for on demand utilization of our technologies 
one of the strategic initiatives of the company in was to increase its internal production capabilities  which was accomplished with the february acquisition of plastic printing professionals  inc p  a producer of custom plastic and vinyl documents and identification cards 
in p  the company saw an opportunity to create a unique and powerful set of secure products in the plastic id card market that would allow the company to target the market for secure identification products 
in acquiring p  the company also gained access to a large dealer network that had had traditionally utilized p for its smaller  custom id cards 
during  the company established significant relationships with several of these dealers that have increased the number of people and entities that are marketing and selling the company s technologies 
in addition  the acquisition provided a significant source of revenue growth and positive operating cash flow 
the company plans to continue to pursue acquisitions similar to p to allow the company to strategically increase its internal production capabilities and to gain a foothold in various markets through existing customer relationships that can be enhanced and expanded by integrating the company s technologies and products into existing product offerings of acquired companies 
in addition  during the company was able to bring to market a new product  authentiguard on demand  which we feel could be a significant source of revenue for the company for and beyond 
developed in the latter part of by our research and development team  authentiguard on demand  was fully implemented for its first customer  a large international bank which needed a custom solution to a counterfeiting issue that they had experienced with a variable information document 
based on this early success  we entered into what we believe is a significant relationship with the ergonomic group  a leading information management firm in the northeast  to fully co develop and market the on demand product with initial focus on the financial  high technology and medical records markets 
for this right  the ergonomic group paid the company  in a non refundable upfront license fees and pre paid royalties during that will be recognized as revenue over the two year license period 
thus  while the revenue impact of these customer relationships was not significant in  the company believes that these early successes point to the large potential of this product for the company 
prior to  the company expended a great deal of time and resources to develop and protect its patent portfolio and readied itself for its patent infringement case and related cases against the european central bank  or ecb  which was commenced in august with an infringement lawsuit filed against the ecb in the court of first instance 
during  the company prepared for the multiple impending court proceedings against the ecb  which commenced in january of with the invalidity lawsuit in the united kingdom 
in addition  during  the company entered into a significant agreement that allows the company to pay its legal fees to the lead counsel in the invalidity actions against the ecb with the company s equity 
this arrangement significantly reduces the cash requirements of pursuing these cases 
for more detail on the litigation against the ecb  see item legal proceedings of this k 
the company experienced significant revenue growth of during compared to primarily as the results of its acquisition of p  sales of safety paper to boise and paperlinx  and a new license agreement with rr donnelley that commenced on august  however  despite the revenue gains  the company did continue to experience substantial operating losses during  which were driven by substantial increases in non cash expenses for stock based payments and patent amortization  along with lesser increases in all categories of operating expense categories due to the growth in the company s sales and marketing personnel along with increases associated with the newly acquired p division 
as measured on an adjusted ebitda basis a non gaap measurement of financial performance that the company believes is relevant to the understanding of the company s financial results as defined below  the company realized a stabilization of losses despite significant increases in the size and scope of the organization that were made in order to fully execute its business strategies which the company expects will drive revenue growth toward profitable levels in or in addition  the receipt of approximately  in deferred revenues  while not reflected in operating income in  significantly improved the operating cash flows of the company during the second half of while operating cash flows were positive in the second half of  the company did use cash for operations and the financing of its acquisition of p and for certain patent defense costs throughout the company offset these uses of cash through the sale of its equity to warrant holders and to private placement investors  which in the aggregate raised approximately million during the company had cash on hand of approximately million as of december  results of operations for the fiscal years ended december   and the following discussion and analysis provides information that our management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and footnotes that appear elsewhere in this report

in addition  not reflected in the results above are deferred royalty revenues of approximately  which represent payments the company has received for technology licenses and certain of its on demand products for which revenue recognition is deferred over the terms of the license or service 
during  the company continued its efforts to increase the market for its technologies and products by developing sales and marketing channels by a combination of expanding its internal sales and marketing resources and widening its list of partners and distributors 
the following summarizes significant new contracts and business development agreements entered into by the company during renewed and extended its licensing agreement with rr donnelley sons company  the largest printer in north america 
a three year contract  the renewed agreement includes royalties on the usage of dss s securescan technology and began producing revenue for the company during the third quarter of signed an agreement with the ergonomic group egi for the exclusive  limited right to use and market dss s extensive portfolio of security technologies in the high technology  aerospace  financial and healthcare industries

revenue vs security printing and products sales increased in as compared to within this revenue category  document security related sales increased during while sales from our commercial printing business declined during the same period 
this was the primarily the result of a significant decline in business from one major commercial printing customer and our increase in utilization of our internal printing capacity for sales to our security printing customers 
prior to  the company has utilized the revenue it received from it commercial printing and copying operations at patrick printing to offset its research and development costs associated with its security printing technologies 
during  the company focused its printing capacity more towards its security printing projects which necessitated the need to reduce its servicing of certain lower margin commercial customers 
the increase in document security related sales was primarily the result of increases in sales of custom security documents and orders under our distribution and marketing contract with boise 
revenue from our legal supplies business increased during although the sales of this segment appear to be significant as to our total sales  we do not expect that to continue in future years 
the division continues to increase its revenue by seeking to grow its customer base in a cost effective manner

increases in reflect costs associated with a larger organization including higher rent and utility costs associated with the addition of p in february selling  general and administrative vs general and administrative compensation during  the company s general and administrative compensation costs increased as we increased the size of our organization to meet the levels that we felt were necessary to execute our business plan 
during  we added to our internal finance and corporate governance management team  the cost of which was partially offset by decreases in professional fees related to these functions 
in addition  we added to our customer service and operations support staff during stock based payments increased due an acceleration of employee stock options during which resulted in additional stock based compensation of  as compared to professional fees increased in primarily due to increases in legal  investor relation and consulting fees  offset by a significant reduction of sec consulting fees related to the addition of finance personnel to internalize the majority of sec reporting activities 
legal costs consist of general corporate fees and legal fees in connection with the certain litigations 
these legal costs do not include legal costs associated with the application  registration and defense of our patents  which the company capitalizes and amortizes over the expected life of the patent 
consulting fees are primarily directed towards efforts to help the company develop contacts and market opportunities with government and large multinational corporations 
sales and marketing expenses increased during primarily due to the addition of three dedicated sales and marketing persons to the company  and an increase in travel costs associated with trade shows and sales meetings  including several international trips 
in addition  the company hired a public relations firm in to enhance its communications with current and potential customers 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in costs associated with initial sales and promotional material costs incurred in that were not incurred to the same degree in other expenses increased significantly  primarily as a result in increases in rent and utilities  and offices expenses associated with our move into our corporate headquarters in late  our legalstore 
com s move into a larger facility  and the related office costs and utilities costs associated with these moves 
in addition  we saw an increase in it support costs associated with it increase number of personnel 
further  telephone costs increased due to increases in its sales activity  especially for international prospects 
research and development vs we continue to invest in research and development to improve our existing technologies and develop new technologies that we believe will enhance our position in the document security market 
research and development costs consist primarily of compensation costs for four employees who spend all or at least half of their time on developing new technologies or developing new uses for our existing technology 
in addition  we incur costs for the use of third party printers facilities to test our technologies on equipment that we do not have access to internally 
we expect that our research and development costs will continue at current levels for the foreseeable future 
research and development vs research and development costs decreased during primarily due to a reduction in subcontracting costs as a result of the company s acquisition of a color heidelberg press at our printing facility that allowed the company to perform more of its tests in house 
amortization of intangibles commencing in the second quarter of  we began to amortize the costs associated with the patents that we acquired in and the legal costs associated with the development and defense of our patents  including the costs associated with our lawsuit against the european central bank for patent infringement and the related patent invalidity lawsuits 
in addition  we amortize our acquired intangibles from business combinations 
we acquired a significant portion of these assets by the issuance of equity in the company 
our amortizable asset base at december  was approximately million and will generate approximately  in annual amortization expense during the next years 
the company reviews these assets for impairment annually 
impairment of goodwill in addition  as of december   the company has  in goodwill derived from acquisitions 
goodwill is not amortized  but could become a component of expense if an impairment is determined 
during and  the company did not determine that additional impairment exists on any of its components of goodwill 
as part of our annual fair value test of recorded goodwill  we estimated that as of december   our printing unit patrick printing had sustained an  impairment of goodwill 
this non cash charge to operations is presented as loss on goodwill impairment in the accompanying statement of operations 
subsequent events as described in item legal proceedings and note commitments  the company is engaged in a patent litigation with the european central bank ecb 
the company has alleged that all euro banknotes in circulation infringe on one of the company s european patent no b the patent 
in response to this suit  the ecb sued the company in nine national patent courts in europe to have the patent invalidated and therefore  nullify the company s ability to seek infringement actions 
on march   the court of justice  chancery division  patents court in london  england issued its decision in the patent invalidity lawsuit brought by the ecb against the company 
the english court ruled that the patent no 
b the patent  has been deemed invalid in the united kingdom 
on march   the german federal patent court bundespatentgericht in munich  germany  ruled that the patent is valid in germany 
the company has evaluated the effect of these events on the carrying value of its patent assets as of december  under the guidance of fas accounting for contingencies 
the company has determined that these events do not provide enough information to change the company s assessment of impairment of its related patent assets under fas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in coming to this determination  the company believes that the amounts that it is has recorded as a patent asset for the various assets acquired and defense costs in the various jurisdictions in which hearings are being held associated with the ecb litigation are all components of a unitary asset 
accordingly  the company evaluates impairment on this asset in relation to the overall likelihood that the future cash flows from the litigation support the carrying value of the asset 
the company believes that  as a result of the positive ruling in the german court  the basis for its infringement litigation is intact and no impairment has occurred as a result of these events as of december  net loss and loss per share year ended december year ended change change vs

non gaap financial performance measure the following adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and non cash stock based compensation expense adjusted ebitda is presented because the company s management believes it to be a relevant measure of the performance of the company 
the adjusted ebitda is used by the company s management to measure its core operating performance without certain non cash expenditures

these results reflect the increasing influence that non cash expenses had on the company s financial results beginning in while all costs increased during as the company put in place the resources and infrastructure it required in order to execute its business plan  these increases only caused a increase in adjusted ebitda deficits as compared to liquidity and capital resources the company s cash flows and other key indicators of liquidity are summarized as follows year ended december change vs 
year ended december  change vs 
cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operating activities investing activities financing activities working capital a current ratio a x x x as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  representing a increase over december  amounts 
as discussed below  the increase in the company s cash position was primarily due to the receipt of cash from the issuance of common stock through the private placement of shares and the exercise of warrants  which netted the company approximately million during these amounts more than offset the use of million in cash from operations and million in cash for fixed asset purchases  a business combination and to defend its patent rights 
furthermore  as discussed below  the company believes that its cash balance as of december  will satisfy its projected working capital and capital expenditure requirements  including the costs related to its patent defense litigations  for at least the next months 
operating cash flow despite reporting a million net loss during  the company s used only million of cash for operations during the year 
this differential primarily reflects the significance of non cash expenditures and deferred revenue on its operating results 
specifically  the company recorded million in depreciation and amortization expense and million in stock based compensation expense during the  which combined totaled of the reported net loss but do not represent cash expenses to the company in furthermore  the company received approximately million in pre payments from customers for licenses and services for which revenue recognition is deferred over the license period or service period 
the receipt of this cash significantly reduced the use of cash for operations for the company during  especially during the latter half of the year 
as a result  the company s cash flow from operations improved in as compared to despite an increase in net loss of between the same periods 
during  we used cash for operations at a rate slightly greater than our operating cash flow loss during was primarily the result of our operating loss 
while our net loss increased from levels  our cash flow remained consistent due to the fact that our results were negatively impacted by a large increase in non cash depreciation and amortization expenses 
investing cash flow during  the company used approximately million of its cash for the acquisition of p  a producer of plastic printed cards in san francisco  california and approximately  to invest in its patent portfolio  including the payment of legal costs associated with patent applications and the defense of our patents  which includes payments to cover third party experts fees and other fees associated with the company s litigation against the european central bank 
the company expects that these strategic uses of cash will result in future positive cash flows resulting from its ability to maintain and grow its manufacturing capabilities at its p facility  and from potential legal settlements of other arrangements resulting from its investments in its patent portfolio and the defense of its patents 
furthermore  as displayed below  the company has been able to use its equity to offset its use of cash for the investments that it deems important for the continued long term growth potential of the company 
cash paid for interest non cash investing and financing activities equity issued for patent defense costs equity issued for acquisition equity issued for other intangible assets equipment purchased via capital lease during  we used cash for investments in software  equipment and patents of  which was less than the use of cash for investments during during  we were able to use our common stock to pay for investments in patents and contractual rights which we may not have otherwise been able to had we been required to pay in cash 
the use of equity for our investments has allowed us to retain cash needed for operations during the early stages of our business without sacrificing the investments needed to secure our competitiveness in the future 
we anticipate that our investments will increase in the future as we pursue our strategy of increasing our internal manufacturing capabilities 
financing cash flows the company expects to continue its use of equity to significantly offset its cash investing requirements in as a result of its agreement with its lead counsel in its patent invalidity cases against the european central bank which allows the company to use its equity to pay for up to million in legal costs  of which approximately  remains eligible under the agreement as of december  the use of equity for investments allowed us to retain cash needed for operations during the early stages of our business without sacrificing the investments needed to secure our competitiveness in the future 
as the company grows and emerges from the early stages of its development and achieves consistent cash flows from operations  the company expects it will be able to finance a larger portion of its investments with its own cash resources 
during and  the company offset its uses of cash for operations and investing with cash received from the issuance of common stock 
on december   the company sold units at a price of  per unit for gross cash proceeds of  consisting of  unregistered shares of our common stock and five year warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  at an initial exercise price of per share 
during and  we also received from our warrant holders approximately  and  respectively  from the exercise of warrants 
during the third quarter of  the company paid off a term loan of  that released  of cash that was restricted as collateral for the loan 
as of december   the company has approximately  warrants outstanding and exercisable that  if exercised  would produce approximately million in cash proceeds to the company 
our financing activities provided significant cash inflows during primarily from the issuance of our common stock to warrant and option holders who have exercised their right to buy our stock at prices ranging from to 
the proceeds from these investors supported our operations in future cash expectations at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately  and working capital of approximately  the company s working capital position is adversely affected by approximately  in accrued expenses for private placement agent fees paid in january of in addition  there was approximately  in accounts payable at december  related to legal costs associated with the invalidity countersuits by the european central bank in response to our infringement lawsuit against the european central bank which will be paid by issuance of  shares of the company s common stock 
the company expects to use its working capital to support its growth efforts in order to achieve consistent positive cash flow from operations 
in  the company used approximately million in operations as discussed above 
at its current revenue levels  the company expects to continue to use cash for operations during at the pace experienced in the company estimates that it requires a revenue level of approximately million  or greater than the revenue achieved in  to achieve consistent positive operating cash flows 
the company believes that it will achieve this revenue level by the end of based on this expectation  the company has committed significant resources in the areas of research  development  sales and marketing to support its expected revenue growth 
however  the company regularly reviews business conditions to determine whether changes to its expense levels are warranted 
the company s near term cash requirements also include legal costs and fees associated with the defense of its patents that are incurred by law firms  experts and consultants that are not covered under the share payment arrangement that the company entered into with its lead counsel on the suit 
these costs will be incurred as the company contends against patent validity suits in up to nine countries patent courts as part of the european central bank s countersuit strategy in the patent infringement case 
see item legal proceedings 
if the company is successful in its litigation against the ecb  the company believes that it will be able to recover a portion of these litigation costs along with legal fees paid to its lead counsel in common stock 
if the company is not successful in its litigation against the ecb  the company will likely be required to pay a significant portion of the ecb s legal costs as well 
the company estimates that these costs could be substantial and the payment of these amounts could adversely affect the company s financial position 
the cumulative cash requirements for these cases could be as much as  in and early the company also expects to use its available working capital to invest in the expansion of its production capabilities 
the company is currently seeking to move its p operations to a larger facility in the san francisco silicon valley area  as well as investing in additional production equipment so that p can meet expected demand increases for its products 
these capital expenditures are currently expected to be approximately  and are to be financed by a combination of working capital and lease financings 
in addition  in order to take advantage of future opportunities  including mergers and acquisitions  the company may find it necessary to obtain additional equity financing or debt financing  which the company would seek on favorable terms 
the following table summarizes our known contractual obligations and committments as of december  payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years capital leases operating leases key indicators of future results we believe that cash flow from operations is a significant key indicator for the company 
our ability to reduce our use of cash will depend on our ability to grow revenue to a level sufficient to meet our operating expense requirements 
to grow revenue  we may merge with or acquire manufacturing or related companies 
our ability to successfully complete these transactions on favorable terms will be a significant key indicator of our future results 
these acquisitions may require additional funds that the company does not currently have 
to obtain additional investments in the future may require us to issue shares of our common stock 
our ability to sell our common stock on favorable terms will also be a significant key indicator of our future results 
in addition  we believe that our ability to successfully enforce our patent rights  including our current litigation against the european central bank  is a significant key indicator for the company 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  an effect on our financial condition  financial statements  revenues or expenses 
inflation although our operations are influenced by general economic conditions  we do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our results of operations during or critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december  describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns  goodwill impairments  inventory allowances  revenue recognition  and the valuation of intangible assets 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements goodwill impairments goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
with the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized  rather it is tested for impairment annually  and will be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired 
impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level 
reporting units are one level below the business segment level  but are combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics 
under the criteria set forth by sfas no 
 the company has two reporting units based on the current structure 
an impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
the company completed its assessment of any potential impairment upon adoption of this standard and performs annual assessments 
we determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques  including discounted cash flow and market multiple analyses 
these types of analyses require us to make assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions  as well as future expectations 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates  we may be exposed to a goodwill impairment charge 
long lived assets and intangible assets the company accounts for long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generate by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values  depending on the nature of the assets 
fixed assets are carried at cost 
depreciation is computed over the estimated useful life of five to seven years using the straight line depreciation method 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their useful life or the lease term 
intangible assets consist primarily of royalty rights  contractual rights  customer list  and patent acquisition  application and defense costs 
amortization is computed over the estimated useful life of five to twenty years using the straight line depreciation method 
for patent related assets  the remaining legal life of the patent is used as the estimate useful life unless circumstances determine that the useful life will be less than the legal life 
long lived assets to be held and used by the company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we periodically evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets based on estimated future cash flows from and the estimated fair value of such long lived assets  and provide for impairment if such undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
our impairment loss calculations require management to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  including forecasting useful lives of the assets 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  we may be exposed to additional impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations

the company believes that  as a result of the positive ruling in the german court  the basis for its infringement litigation is intact and no impairment has occurred as a result of these events as of december  revenue recognition sales of custom document security products and printing  retail printing and legal products are recognized when a product or service is delivered  shipped or provided to the customer and all material conditions relating to the sale have been substantially performed 
we also enter into arrangements under which we provide hosted software applications 
we recognize revenue for these arrangements based on the provisions of eitf no

 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  collection of the resulting receivable is probable  the fee is fixed or determinable and acceptance has occurred 
our revenues related to these arrangements consist of system implementation service fees and software subscription fees 
we have determined that the system implementation services represent set up services that do not qualify as separate units of accounting from the software subscriptions as the customer would not purchase these services without the purchase of the software subscription 
as a result  we recognize system implementation fees ratably over a period of time from when the core system implementation services are completed and accepted by the customer over the remaining customer relationship life  which we have determined is the contractual life of the customer s subscription agreement 
we recognize software subscription fees  which typically commence upon completion of the related system implementation  ratably over the applicable subscription period 
amounts billed and or collected prior to satisfying our revenue recognition policy are reflected as deferred revenue 
we recognize revenue from technology licenses once all the following criteria for revenue recognition have been met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  the right and ability to use the product or technology has been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable and not subject to refund or adjustment  and collection of the amounts due is reasonably assured

income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between income and expenses reported for financial reporting and tax reporting 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas requires that a valuation allowance be established when management determines that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company evaluates the realizability of its net deferred tax assets on an annual basis and valuation allowances are provided or released  as necessary 
since the company has had cumulative losses in recent years  the accounting guidance suggests that we should not look to future earnings to support the realizability of the net deferred tax asset 
as a result  as of the years ended december  and  the company has elected to record a valuation allowance to reduce net deferred tax assets to zero 
the company believes that the accounting estimates related to deferred tax valuation allowances are critical accounting estimates because the need for valuation allowance is highly susceptible to change from period to period due to changes in deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability balances  the need for valuation allowance is susceptible to actual operating results and changes in the tax valuation allowance can have a material impact on the tax provision benefit in the consolidated statements of operations and on deferred income taxes in the consolidated balance sheets 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we held million in cash and cash equivalents consisting of highly liquid investments having original maturity dates of less than days 
declines of interest rates over time would reduce our interest income from our highly liquid short term investments 
based upon our balance of cash and cash equivalents  a decrease in interest rates of basis points would cause a corresponding decrease in our annual interest income of approximately  for these investments 
due to the nature of our highly liquid cash equivalents  a change in interest rates would not materially change the fair market value of our cash and cash equivalents
