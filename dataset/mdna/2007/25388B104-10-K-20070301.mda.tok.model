the following information has been adjusted to reflect the restatement of our financial results  which is more fully described in the explanatory note immediately preceding part i item and in note  restatement of consolidated financial statements in notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
overview we provide outsourced e commerce solutions globally to a wide variety of companies primarily in the software and high tech products markets

acquisitions and comparability of results we acquired swreg in march  commerce  inc now dr globaltech  inc in december  direct response technologies  inc 
now dr marketing solutions  inc in january and mindvision  inc 
in june the results of these acquisitions must be factored into any comparison of our results to the results for or see note of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   for pro forma financial information as if these entities had been acquired on january  critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are the following revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from services rendered once all the following criteria for revenue recognition have been met pervasive evidence of an agreement exists  the services have been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable and not subject to refund or adjustment  and collection of the amounts due is reasonably assured 
we evaluate the criteria outlined in emerging issues task force  eitf issues no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as net revenue 
we act as the merchant of record on most of the transactions processed and have contractual relationships with our 
table of contents clients  which obligate us to pay to the client a specified percentage of each sale 
we derive our revenue primarily from transaction fees based on a percentage of the products sale price and fees from services rendered associated with the e commerce and other services provided to our clients and end customers 
our revenue is recorded as net as generally our clients are subject to inventory risks and control customers product choices 
clients do not have the right to take possession of the software applications used in the delivery of services 
we also provide customers with various proprietary software backup services 
we recognize revenue for these backup services upon delivery or based upon historical usage within the contract period of the digital backup services when this information is available 
digital backup services are recognized straight line over the life of the backup service when historical usage information is unavailable 
shipping revenues are recorded net of any associated costs 
we also  to a lesser extent  provide fee based client services  which include website design  custom development and integration  analytical marketing and email marketing services 
if we receive payments for fee based services in advance of delivery  these amounts are deferred and recognized over the service period 
provisions for doubtful accounts and transaction losses and authorized credits are made at the time of revenue recognition based upon our historical experience 
the provision for doubtful accounts and transaction losses are recorded as charges to operating expense  while the provision for authorized credits is recognized as a reduction of net revenues 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we must make estimates and assumptions that can affect the amount of assets and liabilities and the amounts of revenues and expenses we report in any financial reporting period 
we use estimates in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts  which are based on our historical experience and current trends 
we must estimate the collectability of our billed accounts receivable 
we analyze accounts receivable and consider our historical bad debt experience  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we must make significant judgments and estimates in connection with the allowance in any accounting period 
there may be material differences in our operating results for any period if we change our estimates or if the estimates are not accurate 
credit card chargeback reserve 
we use estimates based on historical experience and current trends to determine accrued chargeback expenses 
significant management judgments are used and estimates made in connection with the accrued expenses in any accounting period 
there may be material differences in our operating results for any period if we change our estimates or if the estimates are not accurate 
goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets 
we depreciate property  plant and equipment  amortize certain intangibles and certain other long lived assets with definite lives over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on our estimates of the period of time over which the assets will generate revenue or benefit our business 
we review assets with definite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value we are carrying on our financial statements for an asset may not be recoverable 
our evaluation considers non financial data such as changes in the operating environment and business strategy  competitive information  market trends and operating performance 
if there are indications that impairment may be necessary  we use an undiscounted cash flow analysis to determine the impairment amount  if any 
assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if there are indications that an impairment may be necessary utilizing the two step approach prescribed in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
there have been no impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets for the years  and income taxes and deferred taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we record deferred tax assets for favorable tax attributes  including tax loss carryforwards 
we currently have significant us tax loss carryforwards resulting from the tax deduction for exercise of stock options and acquired operating tax loss carryforwards  and a lesser 
table of contents amount of acquired foreign operating tax loss carryforwards 
the benefit of the loss carryforwards from exercise of stock options was recognized as additional paid in capital when the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was reversed in the fourth quarter of the benefit of the acquired tax loss carryforwards has been reserved by a valuation allowance pursuant to united states generally accepted accounting principles 
these valuation reserves of the deferred tax asset will be reversed if and when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized 
we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance of the deferred tax asset on a quarterly basis 
if the benefit of these acquired tax loss carryforwards is recognized  we will not recognize the benefit in the statement of income 
rather  the benefit will be recognized as a reduction to goodwill 
we may face challenges from domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of tax due 
these challenges may include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions  we record reserves for probable exposures 
based on our evaluation of our tax position  we believe the amounts related to these tax exposures are appropriately accrued 
to the extent we were to favorably resolve matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of the aforementioned reserves  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be impacted 
no provision has been made for federal income taxes on approximately million of our foreign subsidiaries undistributed earnings since we plan to indefinitely reinvest all such earnings 
if these earnings were distributed to the us in the form of dividends or otherwise  we would be subject to us income taxes on such earnings 
the amount of us income taxes would be subject to adjustment for foreign tax credits and for the impact of the step up in the basis of assets resulting from a section election made at the time of acquisition 
if these earnings were to be distributed  the income tax liability would be approximately million 
stock based compensation expense 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payments made to employees and directors including stock options  restricted stock grants and employee stock purchases made through our employee stock purchase plan based on estimated fair values 
sfas r supersedes our previous accounting under accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  for periods beginning in prior to the adoption of sfas r  we had elected to apply the disclosure only provision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation as amended by sfas no 
accordingly  we accounted for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in apb and related interpretations 
compensation expense for stock options was measured as the excess  if any  of the fair value of our common stock at the date of grant over the stock option exercise price 
we have adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method under which prior periods are not revised 
stock based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of share based awards that are ultimately expected to vest during the period 
stock based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statement of operations for includes compensation expense for share based awards granted prior to  but not yet vested  as of december  as well as compensation expense for the share based payment awards granted subsequent to december  the fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the fair value of restricted stock is determined based on the number of shares granted and the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 
compensation expense for all share based payment awards are recognized using the straight line amortization method over the vesting period 
stock based compensation expense of million was charged to operating expenses during the related tax benefit of million resulted in a net after tax stock based compensation expense of million for as stock based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statement of operations for is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas r 
table of contents requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
our pro forma information required under sfas  for periods prior to  accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
in march the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which provides supplemental implementation guidance for sfas r 
we have applied the provision of sab in our adoption of sfas r 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized stock based compensation expense be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than an operating cash flow as required prior to adoption of sfas r in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
on november   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas r transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards 
we have elected not to adopt the alternative transition method provided in the fasb staff position for calculating the tax effects of stock based compensation pursuant to sfas r 
as a result of adopting statement r on january   our income before income taxes and net income for the twelve months ended december  were million and million lower  respectively  than if we had continued to account for share based compensation under apb basic and diluted earnings per share for the twelve months ended december  were and lower  respectively  than if we had continued to account for share based compensation under apb see note in the consolidated financial statements in this form k for further information regarding the impact of our adoption of sfas r and the assumptions we use to calculate the fair value of share based compensation

this valuation allowance is due to anticipated limitations  including limitations under section of the internal revenue code  on acquired losses 
any future release of this valuation allowance will reduce goodwill

in prior years  there was uncertainty of future realization of the deferred tax assets resulting from temporary differences and from tax loss carryforwards from operations and stock option deductions  therefore a valuation allowance equal to the deferred tax assets was recorded

we met the requirements under gaap as we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of these deferred tax assets 
this conclusion was based primarily on our earnings history over the last three years as well as our expected future taxable income 
the impact on us taxable income of future stock option deductions should not reduce taxable income to a level that would jeopardize this conclusion or unreasonably extend the period in which we may recognize the tax benefit associated with these deferred tax assets

foreign currency risk our business has historically been transacted primarily in the us dollar and  as such  has not been subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risk 
however  the growth in our international operations has increased our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations as well as other risks typical of international operations  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures and other regulations and restrictions 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 

table of contents foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our consolidated results of operations as exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies result in gains and losses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of income 
to the extent the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions will result in increased net revenues and operating expenses 
conversely  our net revenues and operating expenses will decrease when the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies 
the following schedule summarizes revenue  costs and expenses and income from operations that would have resulted had exchange rates in the current period been the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results
