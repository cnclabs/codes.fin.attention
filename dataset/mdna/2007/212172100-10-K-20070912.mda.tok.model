item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
we are a provider of primary care physician services 
through our network of medical centers and ipas located in miami dade  broward and hillsborough counties  florida  we were responsible for providing primary care medical services or overseeing the provision of primary care services by affiliated physicians to approximately  patients on a risk basis and approximately  patients on a limited or non risk basis as of june  in fiscal  approximately and of our revenue was generated by providing services to medicare eligible and medicaid eligible members  respectively  under risk agreements that require us to assume responsibility to provide and pay for all of our patients medical needs in exchange for a capitated fee  typically a percentage of the premium received by an hmo from various payor sources 
effective october   we completed the acquisition of the mdhc companies 
accordingly  the revenues  expenses and results of operations of the mdhc companies have been included in our consolidated statements of income from the date of acquisition 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included herein for unaudited pro forma financial information for fiscal  and presenting our operating results as though the acquisition occurred at the beginning of the respective periods 
effective march   one of the physician provider agreements with wellcare was amended from a non risk arrangement to a risk arrangement under which we receive for our services fixed monthly payments per patient at a rate established by the contract 
under the risk arrangement we assume full financial responsibility for the provision of all necessary medical care to our patients 
under this physician provider agreement  as of june   we provided services to approximately medicare advantage patients enrolled in wellcare managed care plans 
effective january   we entered into the risk ipa agreement with humana under which we agreed to assume certain management responsibilities on a risk basis for humana s medicare and medicaid members assigned to certain ipas practicing in miami dade and broward counties  florida 
under the risk ipa agreement  we receive a capitation fee established as a percentage of premium that humana receives for its members who have selected the ipas as their primary care physicians and assume responsibility for the cost of all medical services provided to these members  even those we do not provide directly 
medical service revenue and medical services expenses related to the risk ipa agreement approximated million and million in fiscal  respectively  and million and million in fiscal  respectively 
as of june   the ipas provided services to or for approximately  medicare and medicaid patients enrolled in humana managed care plans 
the risk ipa agreement replaces the humana pgp agreement that was terminated effective december  under the humana pgp agreement  we assumed certain management responsibilities on a non risk basis for humana s medicare  medicaid and commercial members assigned to selected primary care physicians in miami dade and broward counties  florida 
revenue from this contract consisted of a monthly management fee intended to cover the costs of providing these services and amounted to approximately million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
in an effort to streamline and stem operating losses  we implemented a plan to dispose of our home health operations in december the home health disposition occurred in three separate transactions and was concluded in february as a result of these transactions  the home health operations are shown as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
medicare and medicaid considerations substantially all of our medical services revenue from continuing operations is based upon medicare and medicaid funded programs 
the federal government and state governments  including florida  from time to time explore ways to reduce medical care costs through medicare and medicaid reform  specifically  and through health care reform generally 
any changes that would limit  reduce or delay receipt of medicare or medicaid funding or mandate increased benefit levels or any developments that would disqualify us from receiving medicare or medicaid funding could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  prospects  financial results  financial condition and cash flows 
due to the diverse range of proposals put forth and the uncertainty of any proposal s adoption  we cannot predict what impact any medicare or medicaid reform proposal ultimately adopted may have on our business  financial position or results of operations 
on january   the medicare prescription drug plan created by the medicare modernization act became effective 
as a result  our hmo affiliates have established or expanded prescription drug benefit plans for their medicare advantage members 
under the terms of our risk arrangements  we are financially responsible for a substantial portion of the cost of the prescription drugs our patients receive  and  in exchange  our hmo affiliates have agreed to provide us with an additional per member capitated fee related to prescription drug coverage 
however  there can be no assurance that the additional fee that we receive will be sufficient to reimburse us for the additional costs that we may incur under the medicare prescription drug plan 
in addition  the premiums our hmo affiliates receive from cms for their medicare prescription drug plans is subject to periodic adjustment  positive or negative  based upon the application of risk corridors that compare their plans revenues estimated in their bids to actual prescription drug costs 
variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in cms making additional payments to the hmos or require the hmos to refund to cms a portion of the payments they received 
our hmo affiliates estimate and periodically adjust premium revenues related to the risk corridor payment adjustment  and a portion of the hmo s estimated premium revenue adjustment is allocated to us 
as a result  revenue recognized under our risk arrangements with our hmo affiliates are net of the portion of the estimated risk corridor adjustment allocated to us 
the portion of any such risk corridor adjustment that the hmos allocate to us may not directly correlate to the historical utilization patterns of our patients or the costs that we may incur in future periods 
during fiscal and  our hmo affiliates allocated to us an adjustment related to their risk corridor payment which had the effect of reducing our operating income by approximately million and million  respectively 
no amount was recorded in fiscal as the medicare prescription drug plan program was not then effective 
the medicare prescription drug plan has also been subject to significant public criticism and controversy  and members of congress have discussed possible changes to the program as well as ways to reduce the program s cost to the federal government 
we cannot predict what impact  if any  these developments may have on the medicare prescription drug plan or on our future financial results 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
certain of the amounts recorded on our financial statements could change materially under different  yet still reasonable  estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience  knowledge of current events and expectations of future events  and we continuously evaluate and update our estimates and assumptions 
however  our estimates and assumptions may ultimately prove to be incorrect or incomplete and  as a result  our actual results may differ materially from those previously reported 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition under our risk contracts with hmos  we receive a percentage of premium or other capitated fee for each patient that chooses one of our physicians as their primary care physician 
revenue under these agreements is generally recorded in the period we assume responsibility to provide services at the rates then in effect as determined by the respective contract 
as part of the medicare advantage program  cms periodically recomputes the premiums to be paid to the hmos based on updated health status of participants and updated demographic factors 
we record any adjustments to this revenue at the time that the information necessary to make the determination of the adjustment is received from the hmo 
under our risk agreements  we assume responsibility for the cost of all medical services provided to the patient  even those we do not provide directly  in exchange for a percentage of premium or other capitated fee 
to the extent that patients require more frequent or expensive care  our revenue under a contract may be insufficient to cover the costs of care provided 
when it is probable that expected future health care costs and maintenance costs under a contract or group of existing contracts will exceed anticipated capitated revenue on those contracts  we recognize losses on our prepaid health care services with hmos 
no contracts were considered loss contracts at june  because we have the right to terminate unprofitable physicians and close unprofitable centers under our managed care contracts 
under our limited risk and non risk contracts with hmos  we receive a capitation fee or management fee based on the number of patients for which we are providing services on a monthly basis 
the capitation fee or management fee is recorded as revenue in the period in which services are provided as determined by the respective contract 
payments under both our risk contracts and our non risk contracts for both the medicare advantage program as well as medicaid are also subject to reconciliation based upon historical patient enrollment data 
we record any adjustments to this revenue at the time that the information necessary to make the determination of the adjustment is received from the hmo or the applicable governmental body 
medical claims expense recognition the cost of health care services provided or contracted for is accrued in the period in which the services are provided 
this cost includes our estimate of the related liability for medical claims incurred in the period but not yet reported  or ibnr 
ibnr represents a material portion of our medical claims liability which is presented in the balance sheet net of amounts due from hmos 
changes in this estimate can materially affect  either favorably or unfavorably  our results from operations and overall financial position 
we develop our estimate of ibnr primarily based on historical claims incurred per member per month 
we adjust our estimate if we have unusually high or low inpatient utilization or if benefit changes provided under the hmo plans are expected to significantly increase or reduce our claims exposure 
we also adjust our estimate for differences between the estimated claims expense recorded in prior months to actual claims expense as claims are paid by the hmo and reported to us 
to further corroborate our estimate of medical claims  an independent actuarial calculation is performed for us on a quarterly basis 
this independent actuarial calculation indicates that ibnr as of june  was between approximately million and million 
based on our internal analysis and the independent actuarial calculation  as of june   we recorded a liability of approximately million for ibnr 
the increase in the liability for ibnr of million or to million as of june  from million as of june  was primarily due to the additional liability recorded for ibnr related to the operations of the mdhc companies 
the increase in the liability for ibnr of million or to million as of june  from million as of june  was primarily due to the additional liability recorded for ibnr related to the ipas converted to a risk arrangement in january consideration of impairment related to goodwill and other intangible assets our balance sheet includes intangible assets  including goodwill and other separately identifiable intangible assets  which represented approximately of our total assets at june  the most significant component of the intangible assets consists of the intangible assets recorded in connection with the mdhc acquisition 
the purchase price  including acquisition costs  of approximately million was allocated  on a preliminary basis  to the estimated fair value of acquired tangible assets of million  identifiable intangible assets of million and assumed liabilities of million as of october   resulting in goodwill totaling million 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized  but are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if certain indicators of permanent impairment arise 
intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their respective useful lives to their estimated residual values and also reviewed for impairment annually  or more frequently if certain indicators of permanent impairment arise 
indicators of a permanent impairment include  among other things  a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate  the loss of a key hmo contract  an adverse action by a regulator  unanticipated competition  and the loss of key personnel or allocation of goodwill to a portion of business that is to be sold 
because we operate in a single segment of business  we have determined that we have a single reporting unit and we perform our impairment test for goodwill on an enterprise level 
in performing the impairment test  we compare the total current market value of all of our outstanding common stock  to the current carrying value of our total net assets  including goodwill and intangible assets 
depending on the market value of our common stock at the time that an impairment test is required  there is a risk that a portion of our intangible assets would be considered impaired and must be written off during that period 
we completed our annual impairment test as of may   and determined that no indicators of impairment existed 
accordingly  no impairment charges were required at june  should we later determine that an indicator of impairment exists  we would be required to perform an additional impairment test 
realization of deferred tax assets we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes based on our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
we also recognize as deferred tax assets the future tax benefits from net operating loss carryforwards 
we evaluate the realizability of these deferred tax assets by assessing their valuation allowances and by adjusting the amount of such allowances  if necessary 
among the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are our projections of future taxable income streams  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences  and the impact of tax planning strategies that could be implemented to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits 
however  changes in tax codes  statutory tax rates or future taxable income levels could materially impact our valuation of tax accruals and assets and could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period 
at june   we had deferred tax liabilities in excess of deferred tax assets of approximately million 
during fiscal  we determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized although realization is not assured  resulting in no valuation allowance at june  stock based compensation expense effective july   we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
prior to the adoption of sfas r we followed accounting principles board opinion no 
 apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for employee stock options 
for fiscal  the company recognized excess tax benefits of approximately million resulting from the exercise of stock options 
the excess tax benefits had a positive effect on cash flow from financing activities with a corresponding reduction in cash flow from operating activities in fiscal of million 
for fiscal  the company had net operating loss carryforwards and did not recognize any tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options because the related tax deductions would not have resulted in a reduction of income taxes payable 
sfas r requires us to recognize compensation costs in our financial statements related to our share based payment transactions with employees and directors 
sfas r requires us to calculate this cost based on the grant date fair value of the equity instrument 
as a result of adopting sfas no 
r on july   we recognized share based compensation expense of million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
as of june   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested stock options  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
consistent with our practices prior to adopting sfas r  we have elected to calculate the fair value of our employee stock options using the black scholes option pricing model 
using this model we calculated the fair value for employee stock options granted during fiscal based on the following assumptions risk free interest rate ranging from to  dividend yield of  weighted average volatility factor of the expected market price of our common stock of  and weighted average expected life of the options ranging from to years depending on the vesting provisions of each option 
the fair value for employee stock options granted during fiscal was calculated based on the following assumptions risk free interest rate ranging from to  dividend yield of  volatility factor of the expected market price of our common stock of  and weighted average expected life of the options ranging from to years depending on the vesting provisions of each option 
the expected life of the options is based on the historical exercise behavior of our employees 
the expected volatility factor is based on the historical volatility of the market price of our common stock as adjusted for certain events that management deemed to be non recurring and non indicative of future events 
sfas r does not require the use of any particular option valuation model 
because our stock options have characteristics significantly different from traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion  it is possible that existing models may not necessarily provide a reliable measure of the fair value of our employee stock options 
we selected the black scholes model based on our prior experience with it  its wide use by issuers comparable to us  and our review of alternate option valuation models 
based on these factors  we believe that the black scholes model and the assumptions we made in applying it provide a reasonable estimate of the fair value of our employee stock options 
the effect of applying the fair value method of accounting for stock options on reported net income for any period may not be representative of the effects for future periods because our outstanding options typically vest over a period of several years and additional awards may be made in future periods 
results of operations the following tables set forth  for the periods indicated  selected operating data as a percentage of total revenue 
year ended june  revenue medical services revenue management fee revenue and other income total revenue operating expenses medical services medical claims other direct costs total medical services administrative payroll and employee benefits general and administrative gain on extinguishment of debt total operating expenses income from operations other income expense interest income interest expense income before income tax provision benefit income tax provision benefit net income comparison of fiscal year ended june  to fiscal year ended june revenue medical services revenue increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal due primarily to revenue related to the operations of the mdhc companies 
the most significant component of our medical services revenue is the revenue we generate from medicare patients under risk arrangements which increased by million or  during fiscal during fiscal  revenue generated by our medicare risk arrangements increased approximately on a per patient per month basis and medicare patient months increased by approximately over fiscal the increase in medicare patient months was primarily due to the acquisition of the mdhc companies effective october  and the conversion of the ipas from a non risk arrangement to a risk arrangement effective january  the increase in the per member per month medicare revenue was primarily due to a rate increase in the medicare premiums and the increased phase in of the medicare risk adjustment program 
the increase in the per member per month medicare revenue effective january  for the operations associated with the mdhc companies  however  was lower than anticipated due primarily to a decline in their medicare risk adjustment scores 
we believe that the current medicare risk adjustment scores of the patient population associated with the operations of the mdhc companies may not fully reflect the current health status of the patients and  as a result  we are working to update and provide more complete information regarding the health status of these patients which we believe will result in a favorable revenue adjustment during our fiscal year ending june  however  there is no assurance that the updated health status information for this patient population will result in any favorable revenue adjustment in future periods 
based on information received from our hmo affiliates and cms  we believe that our medicare premiums on a per patient per month basis will increase by approximately effective january  without taking into account any adjustments resulting from changes in our medicare risk adjustment scores 
there is  however  no assurance that our premiums will increase by this amount  if at all  or that the effect of any cms risk adjustment will not result in a negative adjustment 
under the medicare risk adjustment program  the health status and demographic factors of medicare advantage participants are taken into account in determining premiums paid for each participant 
cms periodically recomputes the premiums to be paid to the hmos based on updated health status  demographic factors and  in the case of medicare prescription drug plan benefits  cms s risk corridor adjustment methodology 
the net results of these adjustments included in medical services revenue for the three month periods ended june  and were favorable retroactive medicare adjustments of million and million  respectively 
the net results of these adjustments included in medical services revenue for fiscal and were unfavorable retroactive medicare adjustments of million and favorable retroactive medicare adjustments of million  respectively 
future medicare risk adjustments may result in reductions of revenue depending on the future health status and demographic factors of our patients as well as the application of cms s risk corridor methodology to the hmos medicare prescription drug programs 
during the three month period ended june  and fiscal  we received payments and recorded amounts due from our hmo affiliates of approximately million and million  respectively  related primarily to medicare risk adjustments and pharmacy rebates relating to the operations of the mdhc companies for periods prior to completion of the acquisition 
while these transactions ordinarily are reflected in our results of operations  since they related to periods prior to our acquisition of the mdhc companies  they were instead recorded as purchase accounting adjustments which decreased the amount of goodwill we recorded for the acquisition 
management fee revenue and other income were million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease of million was related primarily to a decrease in revenue generated under our non risk contracts with humana under the pgp agreement 
revenue generated by our managed care entities under contracts with humana accounted for approximately and of our medical services revenue for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
revenue generated by our managed care entities under contracts with vista accounted for approximately of our medical services revenue for fiscal and fiscal operating expenses medical services expenses are comprised of medical claims expense and other direct costs related to the provision of medical services to our patients including a portion of our stock based compensation expense 
because our risk contracts with hmos provide that we are financially responsible for the cost of substantially all medical services provided to our patients under those contracts  our medical claims expense includes the costs of prescription drugs our patients receive as well as medical services provided to patients under our risk contracts by providers other than us 
other direct costs include the salaries  taxes and benefits of our health professionals providing primary care and specialty services  medical malpractice insurance costs  capitation payments to our ipa physicians and other costs related to the provision of medical services to our patients 
medical services expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal primarily due to the medical expenses related to the operations of the mdhc companies 
medical claims expense  which is the largest component of medical services expense  increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily due to an increase in medicare claims expense of million or resulting from a increase on a per patient per month basis in medical claims expenses related to our medicare patients and a increase in medicare patient months 
the increase in medicare per patient per month medical claims expense is primarily attributable to enhanced benefits offered by our hmo affiliates and inflationary trends in the health care industry 
the increase in medicare patient months is primarily attributable to the acquisition of the mdhc companies and the conversion of the ipas to a risk arrangement effective january  medical services expenses increased to of total revenue for fiscal as compared to for fiscal our claims loss ratio medical claims expense as a percentage of medical services revenue increased to for fiscal from for fiscal these increases were primarily due to an increase in medicare claims expense at a greater rate than increases in medicare revenue on a per patient per month basis caused by enhanced benefits offered by our hmo affiliates and inflationary trends in the health care industry 
hmos are under continuing competitive pressure to offer enhanced  and possibly more expensive  benefits to their medicare advantage members 
however  the premiums cms pays to hmos for medicare advantage members are generally not increased as a result of those benefit enhancements 
this could increase our claims loss ratio in future periods which could reduce our profitability and cash flows 
other direct costs increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  other direct costs increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in the amount of other direct costs was primarily due to the expenses related to the operations of the mdhc companies 
administrative payroll and employee benefits expense increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  administrative payroll and employee benefits expense decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in administrative payroll and employee benefits expense was primarily due to an increase in personnel in connection with the acquisition of the mdhc companies 
general and administrative expenses increased by million or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expenses increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to expenses related to the operations of the mdhc companies  an increase in professional fees and an increase in amortization expense resulting from the intangible assets recorded in connection with the acquisition of the mdhc companies 
income from operations income from operations for fiscal increased by million to million from million for fiscal taxes an income tax provision of million and million was recorded for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the effective tax rates for fiscal and fiscal were and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to certain adjustments recorded in fiscal related to non deductible items 
net income net income for fiscal increased by million to million from million for fiscal comparison of fiscal year ended june  to fiscal year ended june revenue medical services revenue increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in our medical services revenue was primarily the result of increases in our medicare revenue  partially offset by a decrease in commercial revenue of approximately million which resulted primarily from the conversion of certain commercial members of an hmo from a risk arrangement to a non risk arrangement during fiscal the most significant component of our medical services revenue is the revenue we generate from medicare patients under risk arrangements which increased by million  or  during fiscal during fiscal revenue generated by our medicare risk arrangements increased approximately on a per patient per month basis and medicare patient months increased by approximately over fiscal the increase in medicare revenue was primarily due to revenue associated with the ipas that were converted from a non risk arrangement to a risk arrangement effective january   higher per patient per month premiums and the increased phase in of the medicare risk adjustment program 
the increase in medicare patient months was primarily due to the conversion of the ipas from a non risk arrangement to a risk arrangement effective january  management fee revenue and other income of million and million for fiscal and  respectively  related primarily to revenue generated under our limited risk and non risk contracts under the humana pgp agreement 
revenue generated under contracts with humana accounted for approximately and of our medical services revenue for fiscal and  respectively 
revenue generated under contracts with vista accounted for approximately and of our medical services revenue for fiscal and  respectively 
operating expenses medical services expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal this increase is primarily due to an increase in medical claims expense which is the largest component of medical services expense 
medical claims expense increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily as a result of a increase on a per patient per month basis in medical claims expenses related to our medicare patients and a increase in medicare patient months 
the increase in per patient per month medical claims expense is primarily attributable to enhanced benefits offered by our hmo affiliates and inflationary trends in the health care industry 
the increase in medicare patient months is primarily attributable to the conversion of the ipas to a risk arrangement effective january  notwithstanding the increase in the amount of our medical services expenses during fiscal  the increase in our medical services revenue more than offset the increase in our medical services expenses 
medical services expenses decreased to of total revenue for fiscal as compared to for fiscal our claims loss ratio medical claims expense as a percentage of medical services revenue  however  increased to in fiscal from in fiscal this increase was primarily due to the higher historical claims loss ratio experienced by the ipas that were converted from a non risk arrangement to a risk arrangement effective january  in addition  our hmo affiliates enhanced certain benefits offered to medicare patients for calendar other direct costs increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  other direct costs decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in the amount of other direct costs was primarily due to an increase in capitation fees paid to the ipas 
administrative payroll and employee benefits expense increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  administrative payroll and employee benefits expense increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in administrative payroll and employee benefits expense was due to the recognition of stock based employee compensation expense  which was not required to be recognized in fiscal  and an increase in incentive plan accruals 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expenses decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in professional fees and depreciation expense 
income from operations income from operations for fiscal decreased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal due primarily to a million gain on extinguishment of debt recognized in fiscal interest income interest income increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in interest income was primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents and an increase in interest rates earned on such investments 
interest expense interest expense decreased by million  or  to  for fiscal from million for fiscal the decrease in interest expense was related to the amortization of deferred financing costs during fiscal the deferred financing costs were fully amortized as of march  and  accordingly  no related interest expense was recorded during fiscal taxes an income tax provision of million and an income tax benefit of million were recorded for fiscal and  respectively 
as of june   we determined that no valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was necessary and we decreased our valuation allowance by million for fiscal this decision eliminated our valuation allowance and represented a one time gain 
net income net income for fiscal decreased by million to million from million for fiscal due primarily to the million gain on extinguishment of debt recognized in fiscal and the million increase in the income tax provision resulting from the recognition of an income tax provision of million in fiscal compared to a million income tax benefit recorded in fiscal liquidity and capital resources at june   working capital was million  an increase of million from working capital of million at june  the increase in working capital was primarily due to an increase in amounts due from hmos of million resulting primarily from amounts due from our hmo affiliates for favorable medicare premium adjustments  partially offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million primarily due to the cash used to pay the cash consideration in the acquisition of the mdhc companies and an increase in current liabilities of million 
as a result of the collection of the favorable medicare premium adjustments in august  our cash and cash equivalents increased to approximately million as of august  net cash of million was provided by operating activities from continuing operations during fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the million increase in cash provided by operating activities for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in net income of million  a net increase in depreciation and amortization expense of million and a net increase in income taxes payable of million 
the decrease of million in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in amounts due from hmos of million 
net cash of million was used for investing activities from continuing operations in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the million increase in net cash used for investing activities for fiscal primarily related to the acquisition of the mdhc companies and the purchase of equipment 
the increase of million in cash used for investing activities from continuing operations for fiscal was primarily due to an increase in other assets of million related to capitalized acquisition costs 
net cash of million was used in financing activities from continuing operations in fiscal compared to net cash used of million in fiscal and million in fiscal the million increase in cash used for financing activities for fiscal was primarily due to the repayment of long term debt 
the decrease of million in cash used in financing activities from continuing operations for fiscal was primarily due to a decrease of million in cash used for the repurchase of common stock 
pursuant to the terms under our managed care agreements with certain of our hmo affiliates  we posted irrevocable standby letters of credit amounting to million to secure our payment obligations to those hmos 
we are required to maintain these letters of credit throughout the term of the managed care agreements 
in may  our board of directors increased our previously announced program to repurchase shares of our common stock to a total of  shares 
any such repurchases will be made from time to time at the discretion of our management in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions subject to market conditions and other factors 
we anticipate that any such repurchases of shares will be funded through cash from operations 
as of august   we had repurchased  shares of our common stock for approximately million 
we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during fiscal in connection with the completion of the acquisition of the mdhc companies and in consideration for the assets acquired pursuant to the acquisition  we paid the mdhc companies approximately million in cash  issued to the mdhc companies million shares of our common stock and assumed or repaid certain indebtedness and liabilities of the mdhc companies  and  in fiscal   of such shares were cancelled in connection with post closing purchase price adjustments 
pursuant to the terms of the acquisition  we are also obligated to pay the principal owners of the mdhc companies an additional million in cash on october   the first anniversary date of the closing 
we will also make certain other payments to the principal owners of the mdhc companies not expected to exceed million depending on the collection of certain receivables that were fully reserved on the books of the mdhc companies as of december  on september   we entered into two term loan facilities funded out of lines of credit the term loans with maximum loan amounts of million and million  respectively 
each of the term loans requires us to make mandatory monthly payments that reduce the lines of credit under the term loans 
subject to the terms and conditions of the term loans  any prepayments made to the term loans may be re borrowed on a revolving basis so long as the line of credit applicable to such term loan  as reduced by the mandatory monthly payment  is not exceeded 
the million and million term loans mature on october  and october   respectively 
each of the term loans a has variable interest rates at a per annum rate equal to the sum of and the one month libor rate at june   b requires us  on a consolidated basis  to maintain a tangible net worth of million and a debt coverage ratio of to and c are secured by substantially all of our assets  including those assets acquired pursuant to the acquisition 
effective october   we fully drew on these term loans to fund portions of the cash payable upon the closing of the acquisition 
also effective september   we amended the terms of our existing  credit facility to eliminate the financial covenant which previously required our ebitda to exceed  on a trailing month basis any time during which amounts are outstanding under the credit facility and replace such covenant with covenants requiring us  on a consolidated business  to maintain a tangible net worth of million and a debt coverage ratio of to effective october   we drew approximately million under the credit facility to fund portions of the cash payable upon the closing of the acquisition 
as a result of the acquisition  our consolidated net indebtedness increased by approximately million 
however  as of june   we had repaid all of that increased indebtedness and had no outstanding principal balance on our term loans and credit facility 
at june   approximately million was available for future borrowing under those facilities 
we believe that we will be able to fund our capital commitments and our anticipated operating cash requirements for the foreseeable future and satisfy any remaining obligations from our working capital  anticipated cash flows from operations  our credit facility  and our term loans 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements as of june   and have not entered into any transactions involving unconsolidated  limited purpose entities or commodity contracts 
contractual obligations the following is a summary of our long term debt  capital and operating lease obligations  and contractual obligations as of june  payment due by period total less than year years years capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total the payments shown above for capital lease obligations and operating lease obligations reflect all payments due under the terms of the respective leases 
see note to our consolidated financial statements to reconcile the payments shown above to the capital lease obligations recorded in our consolidated balance sheets 
other factors that could affect our liquidity and cash flow are discussed elsewhere in this annual report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at june   we had only certificates of deposit and cash equivalents invested in high grade  short term securities  which are not typically subject to material market risk 
at june   we had capital lease obligations outstanding at fixed rates 
for loans with fixed interest rates  a hypothetical change in interest rates would have no material impact on our future earnings and cash flows related to these instruments and would have an immaterial impact on the fair value of these instruments 
our term loans and credit facility have variable interest rates and are interest rate sensitive  however  we had no amount outstanding under these facilities at june  we have no material risk associated with foreign currency exchange rates or commodity prices
