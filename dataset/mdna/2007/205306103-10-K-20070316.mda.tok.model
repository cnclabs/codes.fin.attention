item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with selected financial data and our financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including but not limited to those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
background cpsi was founded in and specializes in delivering comprehensive healthcare information systems and related services to community hospitals 
our systems and services are designed to support the primary functional areas of a hospital and to enhance access to needed financial and clinical information 
our comprehensive system enables healthcare providers to improve clinical  financial and administrative outcomes 
our products and services provide solutions in key areas  including patient management  financial management  patient care and clinical  enterprise and office automation 
in addition to servicing small to medium sized hospitals  we provide information technology services to other related entities in the healthcare industry  such as nursing homes  home health agencies and physician clinics 
we sell a fully integrated  enterprise wide financial and clinical hospital information system comprised of all necessary software  hardware  peripherals  forms and office supplies  together with comprehensive customer service and support 
we also offer outsourcing services  including electronic billing submissions  patient statement processing  payroll processing and business office functions  as part of our overall information system solution 
we believe that as our customer base grows  the demand for our outsourcing services will also continue to grow  supporting further increases in recurring revenues 
our system currently is installed and operating in over hospitals in states and the district of columbia 
our customers consist of community hospitals with or fewer acute care beds  with hospitals having or fewer acute care beds comprising approximately of our customers 
overview we have achieved a compounded annual growth rate in revenues and net income of approximately and  respectively  over the past five years 
we signed new hospital contracts in  compared with in our gross revenues increased over  while our net income increased  principally as a result of the continued improved financial condition of community hospitals during much of cash flow from operations remained strong and total cash collections achieved a record level of million in we continue to believe that our strong cash performance reflects both the quality of our customer service and our product offerings 
as a result of the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of medicare act  community hospitals began experiencing improved medicare reimbursement starting in april  the month in which the medicare act became effective 
in the past  medicare s payment formula had created a disproportionate burden on smaller  community based hospitals  which also typically depend on medicare for a greater share of their payer mix than larger  urban facilities 
the medicare act rectifies some of this imbalance  raising medicare reimbursements to rural hospitals by an estimated billion over the next ten years 
we believe this legislation will remove one of the primary obstacles to investment by community hospitals in healthcare information technology 
many of these hospitals had postponed or substantially limited such investments prior to the effectiveness of the medicare act 
accordingly  we believe that the financial effects of this legislation on community hospitals has had a positive impact on our financial results and has put us in a good position to continue to grow our business 
our improving results

critical accounting policies general 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we are required to make some estimates and judgments that affect the preparation of these financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  but actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition  and the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition 
sab no 
and sop require that four basic criteria must be met before revenues can be recognized persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on our judgment regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause us to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenues recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
trade accounts receivable are stated at the amount the company expects to collect and do not bear interest 
the collectibility of trade receivable balances is regularly evaluated based on a combination of factors such as customer credit worthiness  past transaction history with the customer  current economic industry trends and changes in customer payment patterns 
if it is determined that a customer will be unable to fully meet its financial obligation  such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing or other material events impacting its business  a specific reserve for bad debt is recorded to reduce the related receivable to the amount expected to be recovered

recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin requires a company to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based upon the technical merits of the position

in september  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab was issued to provide consistency between how registrants quantify financial statement misstatements 
historically  there have been two widely used methods for quantifying the effects of financial statement misstatements 
these methods are referred to as the roll over and iron curtain method 
the roll over method quantifies the amount by which the current year income statement is misstated 
exclusive reliance on an income statement approach can result in the accumulation of errors on the balance sheet that may not have been material to any individual income statement  but which may misstate one or more balance sheet accounts 
the iron curtain method quantifies the error as the cumulative amount by which the current year balance sheet is misstated 
exclusive reliance on a balance sheet approach can result in disregarding the effects of errors in the current year income statement that results from the correction of an error existing in previously issued financial statements 
we previously used the roll over method for quantifying identified financial statement misstatements 
sab established an approach that requires quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of the misstatement on each of the company s financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures 
this approach is commonly referred to as the dual approach because it requires quantification of errors under both the roll over and iron curtain methods 

table of contents sab allows registrants to initially apply the dual approach either by retroactively adjusting prior financial statements as if the dual approach had always been used or by recording the cumulative effect of initially applying the dual approach as adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of january  with an offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings 
use of this cumulative effect transition method requires detailed disclosure of the nature and amount of each individual error being corrected through the cumulative adjustment and how and when it arose 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending after november   and was adopted by the company on december  the adoption of sab had no effect on the company s financial statements 
in june  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue  how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is gross versus net presentation 
the scope of eitf  includes any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer  and may include but is not limited to  sales  use  value added  and some excise taxes 
the task force reached a consensus that the presentation of taxes within the scope of eitf on either a gross basis or a net basis is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed pursuant to apb opinion no 
 disclosure of accounting policies 
in addition  for any such taxes that are reported on a gross basis  an entity should disclose the amounts of those taxes in interim and annual financial statements for each period for which an income statement is presented if those amounts are significant 
eitf is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  the company intends to adopt eitf effective january   and does not believe the adoption will have a significant effect on its financial statements as it does not intend to change its existing accounting policy which is to present taxes within the scope of eitf on a net basis 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
this standard defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities sfas 
this standard permits entities to choose to value certain financial instruments at fair value 
entities shall report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company is currently in the process of assessing the impact that the adoption of sfas will have on its financial condition and results of operations
