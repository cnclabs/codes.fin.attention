item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation this annual report on form k contains certain statements of a forward looking nature relating to future events or the future financial performance of biocryst 
such statements are only predictions and the actual events or results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below as well as those discussed in other filings made by biocryst with the securities and exchange commission 
this discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with item  business and the financial statements  including the notes thereto  contained in item of this form k 
overview since our inception in  we have been engaged in research and development activities and organizational efforts  including identifying and licensing enzyme targets  drug discovery  structure based design of drug candidates  small scale synthesis of compounds  conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials  establishing collaborative relationships with third parties for contract research related to the development of our drug candidates to support manufacturing  clinical development and regulatory compliance  establishing collaborative relationships with biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies and governmental agencies or other third parties for the further development and potential commercialization of our compounds  recruiting our scientific and management personnel  establishing laboratory facilities  and raising capital 
our revenues have generally been limited to license fees  event payments  research and development fees  and interest income 
revenue is recognized in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab no 
and emerging issues task force issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf issue 
license fees  future event payments  and research and development fees are recognized as revenue when the earnings process is complete and we have no further continuing performance obligations or we have completed the performance obligations under the terms of the agreement 
fees received under licensing agreements that are related to future performance are deferred and recognized as earned over an estimated period determined by management based on the terms of the agreement and the products licensed 
for example  in the roche and mundipharma licenses agreements  we deferred the upfront payments over the remaining life of the patents which are through and  respectively 
we are currently evaluating the period of deferral for the upfront payment related to the shionogi agreement 
in the event a license agreement contains multiple deliverables  we evaluate whether the deliverables are separate or combined units of accounting in accordance with eitf issue revisions to revenue or profit estimates as a result of changes in the estimated revenue period are recognized prospectively 
future event payments are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of specified events if the event is substantive in nature and the achievement of the event was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement and 
table of contents the fees are non refundable and non creditable 
any event payments received prior to satisfying these criteria are recorded as deferred revenue 
under the guidance of eitf issue and eitf issue  reimbursements received for direct out of pocket expenses related to research and development costs are recorded as revenue in the income statement rather than as a reduction in expenses 
for example  the amounts received from our collaboration with mundipharma for the reimbursement of clinical trial costs and the costs received from hhs for reimbursement will be recorded as revenue in the period the related costs were recorded 
significant direct costs incurred upon entering into a licensing arrangement  such as our sublicense fees to aecom and irl  are deferred and charged to expense in proportion to the revenue recognized 
royalty revenue is recognized based on estimates of royalties earned during the applicable period and adjusted for differences between the estimated and actual royalties in the following period 
if royalties can not be reasonably estimated  revenue is recognized upon receipt of royalty statements from the licensee 
we have not received any royalties from the sale of licensed pharmaceutical products 
it could be several years  if ever  before we will recognize significant revenue from royalties received pursuant to our license agreements or revenue directly from product sales 
future revenues  if any  are likely to fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter 
we have incurred operating losses since our inception 
our accumulated deficit at december  was million 
we expect to incur substantial expenditures relating to the development of our current and future drug candidates 
during the three years ended december   we spent of our research and development expenses on contract research and development  including payments to consultants  funding of research at academic institutions  toxicology studies on existing and potential drugs  manufacturing of our raw materials  drug substance and drug products  large scale synthesis and formulation of compounds  preclinical studies  payments of amounts to academic institutions and others as a result of our recent collaborations  engaging investigators to conduct clinical trials  hiring contract research organizations for regulatory and clinical functions  and using statisticians to evaluate the results of clinical trials 
the above expenditures for contract research and development for our current and future drug candidates will vary from quarter to quarter depending on the status of our research and development projects 
for example  during the third quarter of  we incurred significant costs related to the phase i trials with peramivir and the ongoing validation manufacturing for peramivir drug substance 
results from these phase i trials have enabled us to design the phase ii trials beginning in the flu season 
in addition  we initiated a phase ii pivotal trial with fodosine in january as these trials progress and additional trials are started in other indications  our costs for clinical studies will increase significantly 
in addition  the costs associated with the manufacturing of fodosine and peramivir will increase as we continue scaling up to the larger production runs required for clinical development  manufacturing validation and additional toxicology studies for these programs 

table of contents changes in our existing and future research and development and collaborative relationships also will impact the status of our research and development projects 
for example  in january  we announced a million contract with hhs for the full funding of the development  manufacturing and clinical trials required for licensure of peramivir with both the iv and iv formulations 
in march  we announced a license agreement with shionogi for the development and commercialization of peramivir in japan for an upfront payment of million 
in november we entered into a license agreement with roche for the worldwide development and commercialization for our second pnp inhibitor  bcx in addition to an upfront payment plus an advance payment for manufacturing we performed  roche has taken over the development and is paying all costs associated with this program 
in february  we licensed fodosine to mundipharma for the development and commercialization of this drug in europe  asia and australasia 
in addition to the upfront payment of million  mundipharma is paying of the clinical development costs we incur for fodosine on existing and planned clinical trials  but their portion shall not exceed million 
for the roche and mundipharma collaborations  we will owe sublicense payments to aecom and irl on all upfront  future event payments and royalties 
for the shionogi and green cross collaborations  we will owe sublicense payments to uab 
for  we paid approximately million related to the roche and mundipharma agreements 
the revenue from these agreements has been recorded as deferred revenue on our balance sheet and will be recognized over the remaining patent life of the related drug candidate 
the payments to aecom and irl have been recorded as deferred assets on our balance sheet and will be recognized over the period of the related revenue recognition 
due to the nature of the potential milestones in our collaborations  it is difficult to predict if and when particular milestones will be achieved by us or our partners 
the contract with hhs is a standard cost plus fixed fee contract which provides for the reimbursement of allowable costs plus an element of overhead and profit 
this is expected to have a significant positive revenue impact on our financial statements 
as the costs of our peramivir program increase for the clinical trials  manufacturing and other expenses we will submit invoices to hhs for reimbursement of expenses allowable under the contract 
the expenses are recorded as r d expenses and reimbursements are recorded as revenue 
in the same way  as we incur r d costs for our fodosine program that are reimbursable under the mundipharma contract or r d expenses for peramivir that are related to the shionogi contract  we will invoice the respective company for those costs 
the amounts reimbursable will be recorded as revenue in the same period the costs are incurred 
during january  we initiated a pivotal clinical trial with fodosine in t all  which triggered a million milestone payment from mundipharma 
the revenues expected from the mundipharma agreement in will consist of continuing reimbursement of r d expenses in accordance with the contract and the amortization of the upfront and milestone payments 
the primary revenue expected from the roche agreement for is the continuing amortization of the upfront payment received 
although we may  in some cases  be able to control the timing of development expenses  in part by accelerating or decelerating certain costs  many of these costs will be incurred irrespective of whether we are able to discover drug candidates or obtain collaborative partners for commercialization 
in addition  the achievement of milestones in our collaboration agreements is uncertain and unpredictable and would most likely have a significant impact on our operating results in the periods they are achieved 
as a result  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
if we fail to meet the research  clinical and financial expectations of securities analysts and investors  it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
year ended december  compared with the year ended december  collaborative and other research and development revenue was  for the year compared to  for the increase for was primarily due to amounts earned pursuant to our collaboration agreements with mundipharma and roche  plus the continuing amortization of the upfront payments from those agreements 
research and development expenses for were  a increase from expenses of  primarily attributable to the clinical and manufacturing costs of our expanded peramivir and fodosine programs  a  non cash share based compensation charge related to adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas r in january  increases in personnel and related costs to support the clinical development of our pipeline  and increases in consulting and toxicology 
as of december   the company had incurred approximately million of pre contract costs directly related to the phase trials for both the 
table of contents intravenous and intramuscular peramivir products 
these costs were incurred in anticipation of a contract award from hhs and were required to meet the delivery schedule of the proposed contract 
in accordance with the provisions of federal acquisition regulation  the costs were included in the company s request for proposal and are eligible for reimbursement from hhs 
the million of costs incurred prior to the contract award date were deferred and are included in other current assets on the company s balance sheet at december  in the first quarter of  the million in costs will be billed and expensed 
concurrently  revenue will be recognized for these costs plus the applicable fixed fee 
general and administrative expenses for were  an increase of over the expense of  primarily due to the  non cash share based compensation charge related to sfas r  an increase in professional fees  and an increase in personnel related expenses 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in costs allocated to research and development 
interest income for was  a increase compared to  in this increase was due to a higher average cash balance during and a more favorable interest rate environment as compared to the net loss for the year ended december  was  or per share  compared to a net loss of  or per share in year ended december  compared with the year ended december  collaborative and other research and development revenue was  for the year compared to  for due to completion of work performed under the nih grant for hepatitis c during also  there was an nih grant during for our tf fviia program that totaled approximately  which was completed in research and development expenses for were  a increase from expenses of  which is directly related to the additional contract research  clinical trial and toxicology expenses required for the further development of our lead drug candidates during and an increase in personnel costs 
general and administrative expenses for were  an increase of over the expense of  primarily due to an increase in legal fees related to the mundipharma and roche collaborations and an increase in personnel related expenses 
interest income for was  a increase compared to  in this increase was due to a higher average cash balance during and a more favorable interest rate environment as compared to the net loss for the year ended december  was  or per share  compared to a net loss of  or per share in liquidity and capital resources cash expenditures have exceeded revenues since our inception 
our operations have principally been funded through public offerings and private placements of equity and debt securities and cash from collaborative and other research and development agreements and to a lesser extent interest 
for example  during december  we raised million approximately million net of expenses through a sale of  shares of our common stock 
during  we received cash from collaborative and other research and development agreements primarily roche and mundipharma of approximately million net of sublicense fees 
based on anticipated cash receipts from the hhs contract and the collaborations with shionogi  mundipharma and roche we expect such cash receipts to increase significantly 
other sources of funding have included the following other collaborative and other research and development agreements  government grants and contracts  equipment lease financing  
table of contents facility leases  research grants  and interest income 
in addition  we have attempted to contain costs and reduce cash flow requirements by renting scientific equipment and facilities  contracting with other parties to conduct certain research and development and using consultants 
we expect to incur additional expenses  potentially resulting in significant losses  as we continue to pursue our research and development activities  undertake additional preclinical studies and clinical trials of compounds which have been or may be discovered and as we increase the manufacturing of our compounds for clinical trials and for the continuation of the validation process 
we also expect to incur substantial expenses related to the filing  prosecution  maintenance  defense and enforcement of patent and other intellectual property claims and additional regulatory costs as our clinical products advance through later stages of development 
we invest our excess cash principally in us marketable securities from a diversified portfolio of institutions with strong credit ratings and in us government and agency bills and notes  and by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure at any one institution 
these investments are generally not collateralized and mature within two years 
we have not realized any losses from such investments 
we have financed some of our equipment purchases with lease lines of credit 
our lease for our current birmingham facilities expires on june  we have an option to renew the lease for an additional five years at the current market rate in effect on june  and a one time option to terminate the lease on june  for a termination fee of approximately  the lease requires us to pay monthly rent currently at  per month in december and escalating annually to a minimum of  per month in the final year  plus our pro rata share of operating expenses and real estate taxes in excess of base year amounts 
in august  we opened an office in cary  north carolina for the establishment of our clinical and regulatory operation 
we currently have  square feet under lease through february this lease requires us to pay  per month and escalates annually to  per month in the final year 
we have not incurred any significant charges related to building renovations since our capital costs during were approximately million and we anticipate capital costs of approximately million in at december   we had long term operating lease obligations  which provide for aggregate minimum payments of  in   in and  in these obligations include the future rental of our operating facilities 
we plan to finance our needs principally from the following payments under our contract with hhs  our existing capital resources and interest earned on that capital  payments under collaborative and licensing agreements with corporate partners  and lease or loan financing and future public or private financing 
for the year  our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balance has decreased from million as of december  to million as of december   primarily due to the monthly cash burn from operations less the cash received from collaborations  which totaled to approximately million net of sublicense fees 
the collaboration with roche for the worldwide development and commercialization of bcx provided an upfront payment of million  which was received in roche has taken over the development and is paying all costs associated with this program 
the agreement also provides for future event payments and royalties to be made by roche upon the achievement of certain clinical  regulatory and sales events 

table of contents in february  we licensed fodosine to mundipharma for the development and commercialization of this drug in europe  asia and australasia 
in addition to the upfront payment of million  which was received in february  mundipharma is paying of the clinical development costs we are incurring for fodosine on existing and planned clinical trials  but their portion shall not exceed million 
in addition  mundipharma will conduct additional clinical trials at their own cost up to a maximum of million 
the agreement also provides for future event payments and royalties to be made by mundipharma upon the achievement of certain clinical  regulatory and sales events 
in january  we initiated our pivotal study with fodosine in t cell leukemia patients  which triggered a million event payment from mundipharma 
in january  we announced that hhs had awarded the company a million  four year contract for the advanced development of peramivir 
funding from the contract will support manufacturing  process validation  clinical studies and other product approval requirements for peramivir 
the contract is a standard cost plus fixed fee contract  which will have a significant positive impact on our financial position and cash flow 
we will bill our incurred costs to hhs on a monthly basis 
any significant delays in payment or cancellation of this contract by hhs would have a significant negative effect on our financial position 
in january  we announced the initiation of a pivotal phase iib clinical trial with fodosine in patients with t all 
this trial is being conducted under a spa negotiated with the fda 
in addition  we are in active discussions with the fda to determine what would be required to initiate a pivotal clinical trial with fodosine in ctcl patients later in with the initiation of the pivotal phase iib clinical trial  we achieved one milestone related to our collaboration with mundipharma  which triggered a million payment 
in addition  mundipharma will reimburse us for our clinical development costs of fodosine up to the million defined in our agreement 
in march  we announced a collaborative agreement with shionogi for rights to peramivir in japan 
this agreement requires an upfront payment of million that will be received in with the award of the hhs contract to fund the development of peramivir and the current and planned trials for fodosine  we expect an increase in our research and development expenses for however  with the expected reimbursement from the hhs contract and our other partners  we are projecting our net cash burn rate to average approximately million per month in we caution that both our expenses and our cash flows will vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to the nature of the trials in influenza and the reimbursement from hhs 
as our clinical programs continue to grow and patient enrollment increases  our costs will increase 
our current and planned clinical trials plus the related manufacturing  personnel resources and testing required to support the development of our drug candidates will consume significant capital resources and will increase our expenses 
our expenses  revenues and burn rate could vary significantly depending on many factors  including our ability to raise additional capital  the development progress of our collaborative agreements for our drug candidates  the amount of funding we receive from hhs for peramivir  the amount of funding or assistance  if any  we receive from other governmental agencies or other new partnerships with third parties for the development of our drug candidates  the progress and results of our current and proposed clinical trials for our most advanced drug products  the progress made in the manufacturing of our lead products and the progression of our other programs 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
with our currently available funds and amounts to be received from hhs  shionogi and our other collaborators  we believe these resources will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
however  this is a forward looking statement  and there may be changes that would consume available resources significantly before such time 
our long term capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend upon many factors  including our ability to perform under the contract with hhs and receive reimbursement  the progress and magnitude of our research  drug discovery and development programs  changes in existing collaborative relationships or government contracts  our ability to establish additional collaborative relationships with academic institutions  biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies and governmental agencies or other third parties  
table of contents the extent to which our partners  including governmental agencies will share in the costs associated with the development of our programs or run the development programs themselves  our ability to negotiate favorable development and marketing strategic alliances for our drug candidates  the scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials to identify and evaluate drug candidates  our ability to enroll sites and patients in our clinical trials  the scope of manufacturing of our drug candidates to support our preclinical research and clinical trials  increases in personnel and related costs to support the development of our drug candidates  the scope of validation for the manufacturing of our drug substance and drug products required for future nda filings  competitive and technological advances  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims  our dependence on others for development and commercialization of our product candidates  and successful commercialization of our products consistent with our licensing strategy 
we expect that we will be required to raise additional capital to complete the development and commercialization of our current product candidates 
additional funding  whether through additional sales of securities or collaborative or other arrangements with corporate partners or from other sources  including governmental agencies in general and from the hhs contract specifically  may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
the issuance of preferred or common stock or convertible securities  with terms and prices significantly more favorable than those of the currently outstanding common stock  could have the effect of diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or rights of our existing stockholders 
in addition  collaborative arrangements may require us to transfer certain material rights to such corporate partners 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate certain of our research and development programs 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we are not involved in any material unconsolidated spe or off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations in the table below  we set forth our enforceable and legally binding obligations and future commitments and obligations related to all contracts that we are likely to continue regardless of the fact that they are cancelable as of december  some of the amounts we include in this table are based on management s estimates and assumptions about these obligations  including their duration  the possibility of renewal  anticipated actions by third parties  and other factors 
because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective  the obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table 

table of contents payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on biocryst s balance sheet under gaap total purchase obligations include commitments related to clinical development  manufacturing and research operations and other significant purchase commitments 
in addition to the above  we have committed to make potential future sublicense payments to third parties as part of in licensing and development programs 
payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable  such contingencies have not been recorded on our balance sheet 
critical accounting policies we have established various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which were utilized in the preparation of our financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of operations 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements included in our annual report on form k for the year ended december   we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and affect the more significant judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenues have generally been limited to license fees  event payments  research and development fees  and interest income 
revenue is recognized in accordance with sab no 
and eitf issue license fees  future event payments  and research and development fees are recognized as revenue when the earnings process is complete and we have no further continuing performance obligations  or we have completed the performance obligations under the terms of the agreement 
fees received under licensing agreements that are related to future performance are deferred and recognized as earned over an estimated period determined by management based on the terms of the agreement and the products licensed 
for example  in the roche and mundipharma licenses agreements  we deferred the upfront payments over the remaining life of the patents which are and  respectively 
we are currently evaluating the deferral period for recognizing the upfront payment from shionogi 
in the event a license agreement contains multiple deliverables  we evaluate whether the deliverables are separate or combined units of accounting in accordance with eitf issue revisions to revenue or profit estimates as a result of changes in the estimated revenue period are recognized prospectively 
future event payments are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of specified events if the event is substantive in nature and the achievement of the event was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement and 
table of contents the fees are non refundable and non creditable 
any event payments received prior to satisfying these criteria are recorded as deferred revenue 
under the guidance of eitf issue and eitf issue  reimbursements received for direct out of pocket expenses related to research and development costs are recorded as revenue in the income statement rather than as a reduction in expenses 
for example  the amounts received from our collaboration with mundipharma for the reimbursement of clinical trial costs and the costs received from hhs for reimbursement will be recorded as revenue in the period the related costs were recorded 
significant direct costs incurred upon entering into a licensing arrangement  such as our sublicense fees to aecom and irl  are deferred and charged to expense in proportion to the revenue recognized 
royalty revenue is recognized based on estimates of royalties earned during the applicable period and adjusted for differences between the estimated and actual royalties in the following period 
if royalties can not be reasonably estimated  revenue is recognized upon receipt of royalty statements from the licensee 
we have not received any royalties from the sale of licensed pharmaceutical products 
research and development expenses major components of r d expenses consist of personnel costs  including salaries and benefits  manufacturing costs  clinical  regulatory  and toxicology services performed by contract research organizations cro s  materials and supplies  and overhead allocations consisting of various administrative and facilities related costs 
we charge these costs to expense when incurred  consistent with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for research and development costs 
these costs are a significant component of r d expenses 
most of our manufacturing and our clinical and preclinical studies are performed by third party cro s 
we accrue costs for studies performed by cro s over the service periods specified in the contracts and adjust our estimates  if required  based upon our on going review of the level of services actually performed 
we expense both our internal and external research and development costs as incurred 
additionally  we have license agreements with third parties  such as aecom and irl that require maintenance fees or fees related to sublicense agreements 
these fees are generally expensed as incurred unless they are related to revenues that have been deferred in which case the expenses will be deferred and recognized over the related revenue recognition period 
we group our r d expenses into two major categories direct external expenses and all other r d expenses 
direct external expenses consist of costs of outside parties to conduct laboratory studies  to develop manufacturing processes and manufacture the product candidate  to conduct and manage clinical trials and similar costs related to our clinical and preclinical studies 
these costs are accumulated and tracked by program 
all other r d expenses consist of costs to compensate personnel  to purchase lab supplies and services  to maintain our facility  equipment and overhead and similar costs of our research and development efforts 
these costs apply to work on our clinical and preclinical candidates as well as our discovery research efforts 
these costs have not been charged directly to each program historically because the number of product candidates and projects in research and development may vary from period to period and because we utilize internal resources across multiple projects at the same time 
the following table summarizes our r d expenses for the periods indicated year ended december  direct external r d expenses by program pnp inhibitor fodosine pnp inhibitor bcx neuraminidase inhibitor peramivir hepatitis c polymerase inhibitor tissue factor factor viia inhibitor other all other r d expenses compensation and fringe benefits 
table of contents year ended december  supplies and services maintenance  depreciation  and amortization overhead allocation and other total r d expenses at this time  due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial process and given the stages of our various product development programs  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development of our drug candidates for potential commercialization 
while we are currently focused on advancing each of our development programs  our future r d expenses will depend on the determinations we make as to the scientific and clinical success of each drug candidate  as well as ongoing assessments as to each drug candidate s commercial potential 
as such  we are unable to predict how we will allocate available resources among our product development programs in the future 
in addition  we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty the development progress of our existing partnerships for our drug candidates  which drug candidates will be subject to future collaborations  when such arrangements will be secured  if at all  and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements 
the successful development of our drug candidates is uncertain and subject to a number of risks 
we cannot be certain that any of our drug candidates will prove to be safe and effective or will meet all of the applicable regulatory requirements needed to receive and maintain marketing approval 
data from preclinical studies and clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory clearance 
we  the fda or other regulatory authorities may suspend clinical trials at any time if we or they believe that the subjects participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable risks or if such regulatory agencies find deficiencies in the conduct of the trials or other problems with our products under development 
delays or rejections may be encountered based on additional governmental regulation  legislation  administrative action or changes in fda or other regulatory policy during development or the review process 
other risks associated with our product development programs are described in risk factors in part i  item a of this annual report on form k  as updated from time to time in our subsequent periodic reports and current reports filed with the sec 
due to these uncertainties  accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate cost to bring a product to market  the timing of completion of any of our product development programs and the period in which material net cash inflows from any of our product development programs will commence are unavailable 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders  communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
we make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us 
we periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include fees paid to contract research organizations in connection with preclinical and toxicology studies and clinical trials  fees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical trials  fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of our raw materials  drug substance and drug products  and professional service fees 
we base our expenses related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and clinical research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation  vary from contract to 
table of contents contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones 
in accruing service fees  we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period 
if the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate  we will adjust the accrual accordingly 
if we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services  our actual expenses could differ from our estimates 
stock based compensation at december   we have two stock based employee compensation plans  the stock incentive plan and the employee stock purchase plan 
prior to january   we accounted for these plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and other related interpretations  as permitted by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation statement no 

no stock based compensation cost related to our employees was recognized in the statements of operations for any period ending prior to january   as all options granted to our employees had exercise prices equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment statement no 
r  using the modified prospective transition method 
compensation cost recognized during included a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of statement no 
 and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of statement no 
r 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
under the fair value recognition provisions of statement no 
r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period of the award 
consistent with the valuation method we used for disclosure only purposes under the provisions of statement no 
 we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate fair value under statement no 
r 
determining the appropriate fair value model and the related assumptions for the model requires judgment  including estimating the life of an award  the stock price volatility  and the expected term 
compensation cost is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing our risk 
we invest excess cash principally in us marketable securities from a diversified portfolio of institutions with strong credit ratings and in us government and agency bills and notes  and by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure at any one institution 
some of the securities we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we schedule our investments to have maturities that coincide with our expected cash flow needs  thus avoiding the need to redeem an investment prior to its maturity date 
accordingly  we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosure is provided
