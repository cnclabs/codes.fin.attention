item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as of december  and for the years ended december   and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and the selected financial data included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are engaged in the provision of dna testing services that generate genetic profile information by analyzing an organism s unique genetic identity 
we focus our business on dna testing primarily for human identity and to a lesser extent agricultural applications 
in the human identity area  we provide dna testing services for forensic  family relationship and security applications 
forensic dna testing is primarily used to establish or maintain databases of individuals convicted of crimes or  in some instances  arrested in connection with crimes  confirm that a suspect committed a particular crime or to exonerate an innocent person 
family relationship dna testing is used to establish whether two or more people are genetically related 
recently  dna testing has been used by individuals and employers in security applications by seeking to establish a person s genetic identity and store it for identification purposes in the event of an emergency or accident 
in agricultural applications  we provide dna testing services for food safety and selective trait breeding 
we have operations in the us and in the uk  and the majority of our current customers are based in these two countries 
over the past few years  we have completed our transformation from a technology development organization to a dna laboratory testing company  with multiple service offerings in the us and the uk 
on november   we entered into definitive agreements with certain new and existing institutional investors to raise approximately million in gross proceeds million in net proceeds after direct transaction costs in a common stock private placement 
pursuant to the agreements  we sold approximately  shares of common stock at per share 
the transaction closed on november  we filed a registration statement on form s covering the resale of the shares of common stock sold in the transaction  which was declared effective by the sec on december  our operations in the uk provided all of our agricultural testing services  in addition to a portion of our paternity and forensic dna testing services  and accounted for and of our total revenues for and  respectively 
for the years ended december  and  and  respectively  of our uk revenues were derived through agreements with two contractors  which were the department for environment  food and rural affairs  or defra and forensic alliance ltd  or fal 
we expect our uk operations to continue to be a significant part of our business 
we perform forensic testing services for several police forces throughout the uk through our agreement with fal 
revenues derived through the fal agreement accounted for approximately and of our total revenues and approximately and of our uk revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  fal was acquired by lgc ltd  or lgc  a provider of analytical and diagnostic services  including dna testing services  and to that extent lgc is in a position to compete for the business we currently conduct through the fal agreement 
on july   we received from fal notice of termination of this 
table of contents agreement  effective july  as a result of our receipt of the notice of termination  we are in discussions with lgc regarding the transitioning of services we provide to uk police forces  including addressing the provision of services to police forces whose contract with fal extends beyond the termination of our contract with fal 
we have been and are implementing plans to enable us to directly provide our services to uk police forces and extend our offerings of forensic services 
to date  we have successfully bid  in competitive bidding processes  on forensic contracts with three different uk police forces 
additionally  in december  we submitted another bid to provide forensic services to multiple police forces in the uk 
we expect a decision with respect to this bid will be announced in the spring of in october  our contract with defra was extended through december under the terms of the agreement extension  we will now become the exclusive supplier of genotyping services offered to sheep farmers under the uk government s national scrapie plan  or nsp  for great britain  which is designed to help british farmers breed sheep with reduced genetic susceptibility to the disease 
operating highlights our revenues are predominately generated from dna testing services provided to our customers 
our costs and expenses include costs of service revenues  research and development expenses  marketing and sales expenses  general and administrative expenses and other income and expense 
costs of service revenues consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  laboratory supplies  fees paid for the collection of samples and facility expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers for development  laboratory supplies and other expenses related to the design  development  testing and enhancement of our services 
marketing and sales expenses consist of salaries and benefits for marketing and sales personnel within our organization and all related costs of selling and marketing our services 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  professional fees and other corporate expenses 
our operating results declined for as compared to overall  for the year ended december   as compared to  total revenues decreased by  and gross margin decreased to as compared to in the comparable period in the decline in revenues and gross margin was primarily a result of declines in revenues from our us government paternity testing services  uk forensic testing services and uk agricultural testing services and increased laboratory personnel costs 
the decline in revenues and gross margin was partially offset by increased revenues from our uk contracted government paternity testing services and us forensics testing services 
for the year ended december   our operating expenses  other than cost of service revenues  decreased by as compared to  primarily as a result of decreased marketing and sales  general and administrative and research and development expenses due to our focus on cost containment  as well as a decrease in restructuring expenses 

table of contents results of operations years ended december  and the following table sets forth a year over year comparison of the components of our net loss for the years ended december  and change change in thousands total revenues cost of service revenues research and development marketing and sales general and administrative impairment of assets restructuring amortization of intangible assets interest income interest expense other income expense income tax expense net loss revenues total revenues for the year ended december  of million represented a decrease of approximately million  or approximately  as compared to revenues of million for our us service revenues for the year ended december  of million declined by million  or approximately  as compared to million for  primarily due to declines in pricing and volume for our government paternity testing services 
we are experiencing severe pricing pressure in our government funded paternity services as the federal government recently reduced the reimbursement percentage of the cost of paternity testing to the states from to 
we expect this pricing pressure to continue 
this decline was slightly offset by increased volume for our us forensic testing services 
revenues from our uk based testing services declined by million  or approximately  to million during the year ended december   as compared to million for specifically  our uk based testing services declined due to reduced volume and pricing in non violent crime testing services and reduced volume in scrapie testing services  with such declines partially offset by increased revenues from government paternity testing due to increased volume and pricing 
for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  our uk revenues were favorably impacted by approximately  as a result of the exchange rate movement of the british pound as compared to the us dollar 
the significant percentage of our revenue derived from our uk operations makes us vulnerable to future fluctuations in the exchange rate  and while there is currently no material adverse impact to our financial results  future material adverse exchange rate movements would have an unfavorable translation impact on our consolidated financial results 
our operations in the uk provided a portion of our forensic and paternity dna testing services  in addition to all of our agricultural testing services  and accounted for approximately and of our total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as discussed above  for the years ended december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our uk revenues were derived through agreements with two contractors  which were defra and fal 

table of contents revenues derived through the fal agreement accounted for approximately and of our total revenues and approximately and of our uk revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
fal has notified us that our agreement with them will terminate effective july  although we have taken steps to market our services historically provided through fal directly to police forces in the uk  there can be no assurances that we will successfully transition to a direct service provider after the termination of the fal agreement 
if we are unsuccessful in making this transition  future revenues could be negatively impacted 
we have been and are implementing plans to enable us to directly provide our services to uk police forces and extend our offerings of forensic services 
to date  we have successfully bid  in competitive bidding processes  on forensic contracts with three different uk police forces 
additionally  in december  we submitted another bid to provide forensic services to multiple police forces in the uk 
we expect a decision with respect to this bid will be announced in the spring of we expect our uk operations to continue to be a significant part of our business 
in october  our contract with defra was extended through december under the terms of the agreement extension  we will now become the exclusive supplier of genotyping services offered to sheep farmers under the uk government s nsp  which is designed to help british farmers breed sheep with reduced genetic susceptibility to the disease 
although we became the exclusive supplier of genotyping services under the nsp  we expect revenues under our contract with defra to decline for the year ending december  as compared to the year ended december  due to lowered pricing 
during the year ended december   we recognized million in other revenues  specifically license and grant revenues  as compared to million for the decline in other revenues is principally due to lower royalties received on our microfluidic technology during the year ended december  our microfluidic technology patents do not relate to our business of dna testing services 
effective september   motorola  inc  or motorola  converted its exclusive license to our microfluidic technology to a non exclusive license agreement 
under the exclusive license  motorola paid us a minimum annual fee of million  while the non exclusive license payments are of sales of products incorporating our technology by motorola 
cost of service revenues cost of service revenues were million  or approximately of total revenues  for the year ended december   compared to million  or approximately of total revenues  for the increase in cost of service revenues and cost of service revenues as a percentage of total revenues primarily reflects declines in pricing and volumes for our us government paternity testing services and uk non violent crime testing services  as well as increased laboratory personnel costs 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million from million for the decrease was primarily a result of spending reductions following the closure of our former germantown  maryland facility in september marketing and sales marketing and sales expenses for the year ended december  were million  as compared to million for the decrease in marketing and sales expenses of million was primarily due to decreased personnel costs  travel costs and spending in radio advertising related to our marketing and sales programs in our private paternity testing business 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  as compared to million for the comparable period of the prior year 
the decrease in general 
table of contents and administrative expenses for the year ended december  included decreases in travel  recruiting  rent  depreciation and personnel costs  due to our focus on cost containment 
the decreases were partially offset by increases in consulting expenses and stock based compensation recorded in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r 
restructuring restructuring expenses for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  as compared to million for the comparable period of the prior year 
the restructuring costs in primarily consisted of employee severance costs resulting from workforce reductions in our princeton  new jersey corporate office and for facility obligation costs for our former germantown  maryland and dallas  texas facilities 
the restructuring costs in were primarily for employee severance costs related to workforce reductions in our corporate office and the germantown  maryland facility  as well as for other costs related to the closure of the germantown  maryland facility 
amortization of intangible assets during each of the years ended december  and  we recorded million of amortization expense 
total other income  net interest income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million during the same period of the prior year 
we did not incur any interest expense in  as our outstanding long term debt was paid in full during the third quarter of interest expense for the year ended december  was million 
other income for the year ended december  was million  which primarily consisted of non cash gains resulting from the reversal of certain non operating accounts payable and accrued expenses and a reduction in the fair value of a lease guarantee liability  partially offset by an accrual of a penalty payment associated with our february private placement equity offering  losses on disposal of fixed assets and an impairment charge on available for sale securities that were determined to be other than temporarily impaired 
other income for the year ended december  was million  which primarily consisted of a non cash gain on the acquisition of treasury stock in connection with the settlement of escrow claims and the return of treasury shares associated with our december acquisition of lifecodes corporation  or lifecodes 
income tax expense during the years ended december  and  we recorded income tax expense of million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   we recognized current foreign tax expense of million  primarily for our profitable business in the uk  and million of deferred foreign tax benefit  primarily for our profitable businesses in the uk and canada 
in  we reversed million of a tax reserve  with the impact included in the above current foreign tax expense amount  for tax return positions taken on our uk subsidiary tax return filings with respect to intercompany transactions due to the closing of the statute of limitations for our uk tax return 
in addition  we recorded a tax benefit of million associated with the sale of some of our state nol carryforwards 
for the year ended december   we recognized a current foreign tax expense of million and million of deferred foreign tax benefit  primarily for our profitable business in the uk 
prior to  we had recorded tax reserves for tax return positions taken on our uk subsidiary tax return filings with respect to 
table of contents intercompany transactions 
in  we reversed million of this tax reserve  with the impact included in the above current foreign tax expense amount  due to the closing of the statute of limitations for our uk tax return and an assessment of our remaining tax position with respect to tax return positions taken on our and uk subsidiary tax return filings 
in addition  we recorded a tax benefit of million associated with the sale of some of our state nol carryforwards 
net loss for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of million  which represented an increase of as compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  years ended december  and the following table sets forth a year over year comparison of the components of our net loss for the years ended december  and change change in thousands total revenues cost of service revenues research and development marketing and sales general and administrative impairment of assets restructuring amortization of intangible assets interest income interest expense other income expense income tax expense loss from discontinued operations net loss net loss allocable to common stockholders our diagnostics business unit was reflected as a discontinued operation for the year ended december  accordingly  the results of operations of our diagnostics business unit have been reflected in discontinued operations for that period 
we completed the sale of certain assets and liabilities related to our diagnostics business unit in january revenues total revenues for the year ended december  of million represented a decrease of million  or as compared to revenues of million for the decrease was primarily due to a decline in our testing volumes related to our us forensic casework services  which was substantially offset by the increases in testing volumes for our us codis and uk forensic businesses 
the decline in our us forensic casework volumes was primarily due to lower than anticipated production capacity in our dallas facility as a result of the transition of work from our former germantown  maryland facility  which closed in september  and lower than expected dna analyst staffing levels 
in addition  we continued to see delays in the timing of the release of bids by states and municipalities for outsourced forensic dna testing under fiscal year nij funding 
revenues from our uk based service business grew to million during the year ended december  as compared to million during the year ended december   driven primarily by increased forensics volume 

table of contents our operations in the uk provided a portion of our forensic and paternity dna testing services  in addition to all of our agricultural testing services  and accounted for approximately and of our total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  our revenues were unfavorably impacted by as a result of the exchange rate movement of the british pound as compared to the us dollar 
excluding the unfavorable impact of the exchange rate movement  the growth rate in uk revenues for the year ended december  was 
during the year ended december   we recognized million in other revenues  specifically license and grant revenues  as compared to million during the comparable period of the prior year 
the decline in other revenues is principally due to lower royalties received during the year ended december  cost of service revenues cost of service revenues was million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  compared to million  or of total revenues  for the comparable period of the prior year 
our gross margin for as compared to the same period in was negatively impacted by lower pricing and the amount of sample testing required per test result for some of our lines of business  the physical relocation in november of our us forensic casework operations to a new facility in dallas  texas and the increases in testing volumes for codis testing services  which have lower average gross margins than some of our other lines of business 
in addition  the implementation of new processes and systems in the fourth quarter of  designed to create future operational efficiencies  had a negative impact on gross margin during the implementation phase 
research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  which was virtually unchanged from the prior year 
marketing and sales marketing and sales expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to million during the comparable period of the prior year 
the increase in these expenses of million was primarily related to the addition of the business development group in the fourth quarter of that was subsequently eliminated in  the expansion of our us field sales team and radio advertising for our private paternity testing services in general and administrative general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  as compared to million for the comparable period of the prior year 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  included million of professional fees related to capital restructuring  equity financing and related other corporate activities which did not recur in in addition  we recorded an additional expense of million for the amortization of deferred stock compensation in as compared to  as the deferred compensation became fully amortized in the first quarter of due to our focus on reducing corporate overhead  we were able to reduce spending in insurance and employee related costs 
these declines were offset by increases in general and administrative expenses in professional fees  franchise taxes  recruiting of personnel  travel  rent  bad debt expense and repairs and maintenance expense 
impairment of assets during the year ended december   we recorded million of charges for the impairment of assets  as compared to million during the year ended december  during the year ended 
table of contents december   the impairment charges were recorded in connection with the closure of our former germantown  maryland and dallas  texas facilities and consolidation into our new dallas  texas facility 
the impaired assets consisted primarily of leasehold improvements and some laboratory equipment 
during the year ended december   we continued to strategically realign our business and evaluated potential future market segments and growth strategies for this initiative 
in connection with this evaluation  we recorded impairment charges of million related to various fixed assets  consisting primarily of laboratory equipment 
restructuring restructuring expenses for the year ended december  were million  as compared to million in the comparable period of during  we recognized million in restructuring charges  primarily for employee severance costs related to workforce reductions in the corporate office  as well as million in restructuring charges related to facility closure costs for our former germantown  maryland and dallas  texas facilities 
during the year ended december   we recognized million in restructuring charges related to one of our former operating facilities in princeton  new jersey 
the charge was a result of a change in our estimate as to when we expected to sublease this facility and the estimated impact associated with such a sublease arrangement 
amortization of intangible assets during the year ended december   we recorded million of amortization expense  which was virtually unchanged from the prior year 
total other income  net interest income for the year ended december  was million  as compared to million during the same period of the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to interest received on higher cash equivalent and short term investment balances in than in interest expense for each of the years ended december  and was million 
our outstanding long term debt was paid in full during the third quarter of total other income for the year ended december  was million  as compared to other expense of million during the prior year 
this increase in other income was primarily attributable to a non cash gain on the acquisition of treasury stock in connection with the settlement of escrow claims and the return of treasury shares associated with our december acquisition of lifecodes 
income tax expense during the years ended december  and  we recorded income tax expense of million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   we recognized current foreign tax expense of million and million of deferred foreign tax benefit  primarily for our business in the uk 
prior to  we had recorded tax reserves for tax return positions taken on our uk subsidiary tax return filings with respect to intercompany transactions 
in  we reversed million of this tax reserve  with the impact included in the above current foreign tax expense amount  due to the closing of the statute of limitations for our uk tax return and an assessment of our remaining tax position with respect to tax return positions taken on our and uk subsidiary tax return filings 
as a result of completing our assessment  we determined that it is probable that we will sustain the tax benefit taken on the and uk tax return filings relating to certain portions of intercompany transactions with our uk subsidiary 
we utilized a study performed by outside consultants to assist us in reaching this conclusion 
in addition  we recorded a tax benefit of million associated with the sale of some of our state nol carryforwards 

table of contents during the year ended december   we recorded net income tax expense of million related to our profitable uk business 
this item was partially offset by million of tax benefit associated with the sale of some of our state nol carryforwards 
net loss and net loss allocable to common stockholders in  we reported a net loss of million compared to a net loss of million for the comparable period of the prior year 
in  all previously outstanding shares of series a redeemable convertible preferred stock were converted into common stock 
in  we recorded dividends and accretion of series a redeemable convertible preferred stock of million  which was included in our net loss allocable to common stockholders of million for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents as compared to million as of december  working capital increased to million at december  from million at december  this increase in working capital was primarily a result of our november common stock private placement  which is further described below 
sources of liquidity our primary sources of liquidity have been issuances of our securities and other capital raising activities 
the following table sets forth a year over year comparison of the components of our liquidity and capital resources for the years ended december  and in thousands change change cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net cash used in operations for the year ended december  was million compared with net cash used in operations of million for the decline in operating cash flows was mainly a result of a higher net loss  an increased paydown in accounts payable and accrued expenses  as well as decreased collections of accounts receivable for the year ended december  as compared to investing activities during the year ended december  consisted of million of capital expenditures  partially offset by the release of million of restricted cash 
investing activities during the year ended december  consisted of million in net proceeds from the sales of short term securities  partially offset by million in capital expenditures 
financing activities during the year ended december  consisted of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million  offset by million used to repay patent obligations 
financing activities the year ended december  consisted of million used to repay debt and million used to repay patent obligations  partially offset by million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
november private placement on november   we entered into definitive agreements with certain new and existing institutional investors to raise million in gross proceeds million in net proceeds after direct transaction costs in a common stock private placement 
pursuant to the agreements  we sold approximately  shares of common stock at per share 
the transaction closed on november  we filed a registration statement on form s covering the resale of the shares of common stock sold in the private placement  which was declared effective by the sec on december  
table of contents penalty on february private placement on february   we issued approximately  shares of our common stock and four year warrants to purchase an additional approximately  shares of our common stock in a private placement to investors 
the per share purchase price for the shares of common stock was and the warrants have a per share exercise price of 
we registered the shares of common stock issued in the financing and the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants on a registration statement on form s  which was declared effective by the sec on may  pursuant to the terms of the securities purchase agreement  we are obligated to pay penalties to investors if the investors were not permitted to sell their shares of common stock received in the financing or upon exercise of the warrants under the registration statement 
as a result of our failure to file our annual report on form k for the year ended december  and our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended march  by their filing deadlines  the investors were no longer permitted to sell their shares of common stock received in the financing or upon exercise of the warrants under the registration statement 
to fulfill our obligations under the securities purchase agreement  on july   we filed a post effective amendment to the registration statement to convert it from a registration statement on form s to a registration statement on form s  to enable the investors to sell their shares of common stock issued in the financing and upon exercise of the warrants under an effective registration statement 
the sec declared the post effective amendment effective on july  as of december   the penalty payment that we are obligated to pay to the investors was million 
restricted cash as of december   cash restricted under one of our operating leases and a government contract  in the amount of million  is reflected as a long term asset in the consolidated balance sheet 
expected uses of liquidity in throughout  we plan to continue making substantial investments in our business 
we expect the following to be significant uses of liquidity cost of service revenues  salaries and related personnel costs  laboratory supplies  fees for the collection of samples  facility expenses  marketing expenses and general and administrative costs  which consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  professional fees  general legal expenses  expenses related to our intellectual property and other corporate expenses 
in addition  we may make investments in future acquisitions of businesses or technologies which would increase our capital expenditures 
the amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous factors  including our development activities  our investments in technology  the amount of cash generated by our operations and the amount and extent of our acquisitions  if any 
actual expenditures may vary substantially from our estimates 
we believe that our existing cash on hand will be sufficient to fund our operations at least through the next twelve months 
we do not anticipate the need to raise additional capital in however  we may need to access the capital markets for additional financing to fund future growth opportunities or to operate our ongoing business activities if our future results of operations fall below our expectations 
if so  we may not be able to raise additional funds or raise funds on terms that are acceptable to us 
if future financing is not available to us  or is not available on terms acceptable to us  we may not be able to fund our future needs 
if we raise funds through equity or convertible securities  our stockholders may experience dilution and our stock price may decline 
we cannot assure you that our business or operations will not change in a manner that would consume available resources more rapidly than anticipated 
we also cannot assure you that we will not require substantial additional funding before we can achieve profitable operations 
we also may need additional capital if we seek to acquire other businesses or technologies 

table of contents contractual obligations and commercial commitments we maintained multiple contractual commitments as of december  which will support our future business operations 
such commitments relate to noncancelable operating lease arrangements  patent obligations and a lease guarantee 
we have identified and quantified the most significant of these commitments in the following table 
payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands contractual obligations operating lease obligations patent obligation other long term liabilities total contractual obligations such amounts represent future minimum rental commitments for office space and equipment leased under noncancelable operating lease arrangements 
such amount represents an obligation in conjunction with our acquisition of us patent no 
 and its foreign counterparts from affymetrix in july such amounts represent an unconditional guarantee related to the lease for the stamford  connecticut based laboratory  which was assigned in connection with the sale of our former diagnostics business unit 
we were required to sign this guarantee as a condition of the sale 
we reflected the fair value of the guarantee at the time of the sale of the diagnostics business of approximately million as a reduction to the net realizable value of these assets and liabilities 
we valued the guarantee based on the existing terms and conditions of the lease  an estimated vacancy of the space for one year prior to subleasing the space and expected rental income from the sublease of the space 
the lease terminates in april of minimum remaining rents under the assigned lease total approximately million 
limitation on the use of our nol carryforwards as of december   our nol carryforwards were approximately million and approximately million for federal and state income tax purposes  respectively 
our federal and state nol carryforwards begin to expire in utilization of our nols to offset future taxable income  if any  may be substantially limited due to change of ownership provisions in the act 
the act provides for a limitation on the annual use of nol carryforwards and research and development credits following certain ownership changes  as defined by the act  which could significantly limit our ability to utilize these carryforwards and research and development credits 
we have determined that an ownership change  as defined by the act  occurred in approximately million of nol carryforwards is limited due to this ownership change 
we may have experienced other ownership changes  as defined by the act  as a result of past financings and may experience others in connection with future financings 
accordingly  our ability to utilize the aforementioned federal nol carryforwards may be further limited in the future 
if our nol carryforwards are limited or expire  we would not be able to offset future earnings with these nols which could negatively impact our liquidity in the future 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition stock based compensation valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill income taxes 
table of contents revenue recognition we recognize dna laboratory services revenues at the time test results are completed and reported 
deferred revenues represent the unearned portion of payments received in advance of tests being completed and reported 
unbilled receivables represent revenue which has been earned on completed and reported tests  but has not been billed to the customer 
revenues from license arrangements  including license fees creditable against future royalty obligations of the licensee  are recognized when an arrangement is entered into if we have no significant continuing involvement under the terms of the arrangement 
if we have significant continuing involvement under such an arrangement  license fees are deferred and recognized over the estimated performance period 
management has made estimates and assumptions relating to the performance period  which are subject to change 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could affect the amount of revenues from licenses reported in any given period 
revenues from research and development agreements are recognized when related research expenses are incurred and when we have satisfied specific obligations under the terms of the respective agreements 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the provisions of  and account for stock based compensation in accordance with  sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
we have applied the modified prospective method of adoption  under which prior periods are not restated for comparative purposes 
under the modified prospective method  sfas r applies to new awards and to awards that were outstanding as of december  that are subsequently modified  repurchased or cancelled 
compensation expense recognized during the year ended december  includes expense for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and expense for all share based payments granted during the year ended december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
stock based compensation is classified within cost of service revenues  research and development  marketing and sales and general and administrative on the consolidated statement of operations 
stock options granted to employees  which are granted with an exercise price equal to or greater than the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant  in general vest in four years in equal monthly installments and have a maximum term of ten years 
stock options granted to our board of directors in general vest in three years in equal monthly installments and have a maximum term of ten years 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term  the number of options that will ultimately not vest and the expected dividend yield 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of the fair value of stock based compensation and  consequently  the related amount recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
the expected volatility assumption is based on the daily historical volatility of our stock price  over the expected term of the option 
our stock options are considered plain vanilla options based on the guidance in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment  and as such we have elected to use the simplified method  whereby we have assumed that all options will be exercised midway between the vesting date and the contractual term of the option to determine the expected term of the option 
we have not paid dividends since our inception  nor do we expect to pay any dividends for the foreseeable future  thus the expected dividend yield assumption is zero 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience 

table of contents valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of amortizable identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant decrease in the market value of the assets 
the impairment test is based upon a comparison of the estimated undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the long lived assets 
if we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on projected discounted cash flows 
the cash flow estimates used to determine the impairment  if any  contain management s best estimate using appropriate assumptions and projections at that time 
net amortizable intangible assets and long lived assets amounted to million as of december  we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter  on a reporting unit basis  or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired 
if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill  an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess 
income taxes 
we have generated nols for tax purposes since inception 
as of december   these nols have resulted in nol carryforwards of approximately million and million for federal and state income tax purposes  respectively 
in addition  certain charges recorded in the current and prior years were not currently deductible for income tax purposes 
these differences result in gross deferred tax assets 
we must assess the likelihood that the gross deferred tax assets  net of any deferred tax liabilities  will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe the recovery is not likely  we have established a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining this valuation allowance 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our net deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of nol carryforwards  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income and the period over which the net deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
conversely  if we are profitable in the future at levels which cause management to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will realize all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets for which a valuation has been recorded  we would record the estimated net realizable value of the net deferred tax asset at that time and would then record income taxes on our us operations at a rate equal to our combined federal and state effective rate of approximately

table of contents our expectation that our instrumentation  automation and new testing methodologies will enable us to reduce our costs for and improve the quality of our service offerings  our anticipation that forensic dna testing will grow based on legislation both in the us and the uk  increased federal funding in the us and improved utility of the growing codis and ndnad databases  our anticipation that our current facilities should serve our near term capacity needs  our anticipation that federal and state governments in the us and national and local governments in the uk will allocate greater resources to support wider use of dna testing  our expectation that the decision with respect to our bid to provide forensic services to multiple police forces in the uk will be announced in the spring of  our belief that farmers expect to produce sheep flocks with greatly reduced vulnerability to scrapie and  in turn  decrease the risk of animal diseases disseminating into the food supply  our belief that the general concern over animal borne pathogens entering the human food supply may continue to expand interest in food safety and this concern may lead to a new market opportunity  our expectation that that there will be new opportunities for us to both develop assays to detect meat qualities  and to perform ongoing agricultural genotyping services for the commercial meat industry  our intention to seek and continue to seek patent protection for novel uses of snps in the genetic testing field  our intention to continue to concentrate on protection of our intellectual property as it relates to our dna testing services  our expectation that our uk operations will continue to be a significant part of our business  our expectation that our existing cash on hand will be sufficient to fund our operations at least through the next twelve months  our anticipation that a portion of our future growth may be accomplished either by acquiring or merging with existing businesses  our plan to continue to market our services to governments  commercial companies and private individuals  our intention to continue to vigorously defend ourselves against plaintiff s claims in litigation relating to our may  ipo  our belief that litigation claims arising against us from the normal course of business will not have a material effect on our financial position and liquidity  but could have a material impact on our results of operations for any reporting period  our expectation to not pay any dividends in the foreseeable future  our intention to retain earnings  if any  to finance our growth  our expectation that severe pricing pressure in our government funded paternity testing services will continue  our expectation that revenues under our contract with defra will decline in as compared to  our plan to continue to make substantial investments in our business  our expectation about our significant uses of liquidity  our anticipation that we do not need to raise additional capital in our expectation that the adoption of sfas and fin will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  
table of contents our expectation that international sales may continue to represent a significant portion of our revenue  and our expectation that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will not prevent all error and all fraud 
while management makes its best efforts to be accurate in making forward looking statements  such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary materially  including the risks and uncertainties discussed throughout this annual report on form k and the cautionary information set forth under the heading risk factors appearing in item a of this annual report on form k 
we disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our exposure to market risk is principally confined to our cash equivalents  which are conservative in nature  with a focus on preservation of capital 
due to the short term nature of our investments and our investment policies and procedures  we have determined that the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations related to these financial instruments are not material to our business 
as of december   we have no long term debt obligations 
foreign currency risk our business derives a substantial portion of its revenues from international operations 
we record the majority of our foreign operational transactions  including all cash inflows and outflows  in the local currency  british pound 
we record all of our us operational transactions  including cash inflows and outflows  in us dollars 
we expect that international sales may continue to represent a significant portion of our revenue 
the significant percentage of our revenue derived from our uk operations makes us vulnerable to future fluctuations in the exchange rate  and while there is currently no material adverse impact to our financial results  future material adverse exchange rate movements would have an unfavorable translation impact on our consolidated financial results 
we are prepared to hedge against any fluctuations in foreign currencies should such fluctuations have a material economic impact on us  although we have not engaged in hedging activities to date 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical change in the value of the british pound to us dollar currency exchange rate and currently estimate that such a change would have impacted loss before income taxes for the year ended december  by approximately million
