our business primary business purpose and description 
our business purpose is to provide natural gas and related energy products in a safe  efficient and dependable manner 
we own or have interests in north america s largest interstate natural gas pipeline systems and are a large independent natural gas and oil producer focused on growing our reserve base through disciplined capital allocation and portfolio management  cost control and marketing and selling our natural gas and oil production at optimal prices while managing associated price risks 
drivers of our profitability 
our pipeline operations are rate regulated and accordingly we generate profit based on our ability to earn a return in excess of our costs through the rates we charge our customers 
the profitability of our exploration and production operations is dependent on the prices for natural gas and oil and the volumes we are able to produce  among other factors 
our future profitability in each of these operations will be primarily driven by the following factors pipelines expanding our existing pipeline systems to meet demand growth and gain access to new supply areas and sources  contracting and recontracting pipeline capacity with our customers  maintaining approval by ferc of acceptable rates and terms of service  including successfully resolving rate cases  and improving operating efficiency 

table of contents exploration and production marketing increasing our natural gas and oil proved reserve base and production volumes through successful drilling programs or acquisitions  and finding and producing natural gas and oil at a reasonable cost 
in addition to these factors  our future profitability will also be impacted by our debt level and related interest costs  successful resolution of our historical contingencies and completing the orderly exit of our remaining power assets  historical derivative contracts and other remaining non core assets 
summary of overall performance in during  our financial performance was relatively stable 
our pipeline business experienced substantial earnings growth and continued to provide a strong base of earnings and cash flow 
our exploration and production business experienced continued success in its drilling programs resulting in higher production levels during each quarter of the year 
however  lower than planned production volumes in and lower than expected commodity prices impacted our ability to attain the operational and financial targets for the year we previously established 
the table that follows and our individual segment discussions provide further analysis of our operating results 
area of operations significant highlights pipelines announced the sale of anr  our michigan storage assets and our percent interest in great lakes gas transmission implemented a ferc approved rate case settlement for colorado interstate gas company and filed a rate case settlement for approval with the ferc for el paso natural gas company re contracted or contracted available or expiring capacity completed several expansion projects and proceeded with other expansion projects in our pipeline systems and at our elba island lng facility repaired significant damage to sections of our gulf coast and offshore pipeline facilities caused by hurricanes katrina and rita e p increased production volumes in each quarter of the year despite lower than planned annual production as a result of delays in bringing certain production online  delays in recovering lost volumes due to hurricanes katrina and rita and higher than planned maintenance in certain onshore fields entered into additional derivative contracts in to manage price risk on a substantial portion of our natural gas production replaced our production primarily through our capital drilling program  achieving an overall drilling success rate of percent marketing entered into agreements to assign  terminate or divest of a significant transportation contract and certain of our historical natural gas and power contracts other resolved various legal and contractual disputes  including a settlement of the pending shareholder and derivative actions  those related to our brazilian power plants and other domestic legal matters divested of a majority of our remaining power operations for total proceeds of approximately billion  including our macae power facility what to expect going forward 
for  we expect our current operating trends to continue 
in our pipeline business  in february  we sold anr  our michigan storage assets and our percent interest in great lakes gas transmission 
we continue to lay the foundation for future growth by establishing an inventory of expansion projects in our primary growth areas and developing significant infrastructure opportunities 
we anticipate that our remaining pipeline operations will continue to provide strong operating results based on the current levels of contracted capacity  continued success in re contracting  expansion plans in our market and supply areas and the 
table of contents status of rate and regulatory actions 
we recently announced that we will pursue the formation of a master limited partnership in to enhance the value and financial flexibility of our pipeline assets and provide a lower cost source of capital for new projects 
in our exploration and production business  we will continue to seek to create value through a disciplined and balanced capital investment program  through active management of the increasing cost of production services  and efficiency improvements 
in our drilling programs  we will focus on delivering reserves and volumes at reasonable finding and operating costs 
our future financial results will be primarily dependent on the continued successful execution of these drilling programs and commodity prices to the extent our anticipated natural gas and oil production is unhedged 
we have hedged a substantial portion of our anticipated natural gas and oil production 
update of credit metrics 
in  we strengthened our credit metrics as a result of several actions taken during the year including reducing debt by billion  primarily through asset sales and issuing common stock  restructuring our revolving credit facilities with improved terms  receiving upgraded senior unsecured debt ratings to b with a positive outlook from moody s and b with a positive outlook from standard and poor s  and entering into contracts to eliminate the price risk on a portion of our historical marketing natural gas book 
our net debt debt less cash was billion at december  including billion of anr debt reported in discontinued operations 
the closing of the anr sale provides us with approximately billion for additional debt reduction  and in february  we launched an offer to tender for certain of our outstanding debt issues 
additional debt reductions will be based on the capital requirements of our pipeline and exploration and production businesses  our ability to generate strong cash flow from these businesses  completion of the sale of our remaining power assets and resolution of remaining historical issues 
our liquidity and capital resources discussions that follow provide further information on these events 
results of operations overview as of december   our core operating business segments were pipelines  exploration and production and marketing 
we also have a power segment with interests in international power plants in brazil  asia and central america 
these segments are managed separately  provide a variety of energy products and services  and require different technology and marketing strategies 
our corporate activities include our general and administrative functions  as well as other miscellaneous businesses  contracts and assets all of which are immaterial 
our management uses earnings before interest expense and income taxes ebit to assess the operating results and effectiveness of our business segments which consist of consolidated operations as well as investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
we believe ebit is useful to our investors because it allows them to more effectively evaluate our operating performance using the same performance measure analyzed internally by our management 
we define ebit as net income loss adjusted for i items that do not impact our income loss from continuing operations  such as extraordinary items  discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of accounting changes  ii income taxes  iii interest and debt expense iv distributions on preferred interests of consolidated subsidiaries and v preferred stock dividends 
we exclude interest and debt expense and distributions on preferred interests of consolidated subsidiaries from this measure so that investors may evaluate our operating results independently from our financing methods or capital structure 
ebit may not be comparable to measurements used by other companies 
additionally  ebit should be considered in conjunction with net income and other performance measures such as operating income or operating cash flow

pipelines segment overview our pipelines segment operates primarily in the united states and consists of interstate natural gas transmission  storage and lng terminalling related services 
we face varying degrees of competition in this segment from other existing and proposed pipelines and proposed lng facilities  as well as from alternative energy sources used to generate electricity  such as hydroelectric power  nuclear power  coal and fuel oil 
our revenues from transportation  storage  lng terminalling and related services consist of two types of total type description revenues reservation reservation revenues are from customers referred to as firm customers that reserve capacity on our pipeline system  storage facilities or lng terminalling facilities 
these firm customers are obligated to pay a monthly reservation or demand charge  regardless of the amount of natural gas they transport or store  for the term of their contracts 
usage and other usage revenues are from both firm customers and interruptible customers those without reserved capacity that pay usage charges based on the volume of gas actually transported  stored  injected or withdrawn 
we also earn revenues from the processing and sale of natural gas liquids and other miscellaneous sources 

table of contents the ferc regulates the rates we can charge our customers 
these rates are generally a function of the cost of providing services to our customers  including a reasonable return on our invested capital 
because of our regulated nature and the high percentage of our revenues attributable to reservation charges  our revenues have historically been relatively stable 
however  our financial results can be subject to volatility due to factors such as changes in natural gas prices and market conditions  regulatory actions  competition  weather and the creditworthiness of our customers 
we also experience earnings volatility when the amount of natural gas utilized in operations differs from the amounts we receive for that purpose 
historically  much of our business was conducted through long term contracts with customers 
however  many of our customers have shifted from a traditional dependence solely on long term contracts to a portfolio approach  which balances short term opportunities with long term commitments 
this shift  which can increase the volatility of our revenues  is due to changes in market conditions and competition driven by state utility deregulation  local distribution company mergers  new supply sources  volatility in natural gas prices  demand for short term capacity and new power plant markets 
we continue to manage our recontracting process to limit the risk of significant impacts on our revenues 
our ability to extend existing customer contracts or remarket expiring contracted capacity is dependent on the competitive alternatives  the regulatory environment at the federal  state and local levels and market supply and demand factors at the relevant dates these contracts are extended or expire 
the duration of new or renegotiated contracts will be affected by current prices  competitive conditions and judgments concerning future market trends and volatility 
subject to regulatory requirements  we attempt to re contract or re market our capacity at the maximum rates allowed under our tariffs  although  at times  we discount these rates at various levels for each of our pipeline systems to remain competitive 
our existing contracts mature at various times and in varying amounts of throughput capacity 
we continue to manage our recontracting process to limit the risk of significant impacts on our revenues 
the weighted average remaining contract term for active contracts is approximately five years as of december  below is the expiration schedule for firm transportation contracts executed as of december  percent of total bbtu d available capacity and beyond summary of operational and financial performance in  we continued to deliver excellent results with strong performance across all pipelines 
we successfully resolved our epng rate case  restructured and renewed certain customer contracts  continued to place several expansion projects in service  including the elba island ii terminal expansion and pipeline expansions in the rockies  such as cheyenne plains  piceance basin  and raton basin  and made significant progress on several other growth projects 
we have also benefited from i higher realized rates on certain of our systems  ii increased throughput in  iii other various interruptible services  iv sales of gas not used in operations and v favorable impacts upon revaluation of gas imbalances 
however  we continue to experience non reimbursable hurricane related costs 
while actual throughput levels have a relatively minor impact on us since we generally sell capacity on our pipeline  the level of throughput can provide evidence of the underlying value of the capacity 
in  increased throughput across our system was a result of broad based increases in power demand from mexico  california  the northeast  and southeast based on underlying growth in electricity demand  a warmer summer  and lower availability of hydroelectric power in the northwest 
we have also experienced higher supply related throughput as a result of our rockies related expansions 

table of contents in  we intend to build on the growth achieved in among other projects currently underway  we are in the process of filing with the ferc several growth projects that will transport lng from georgia to florida and the remainder of the southeastern united states

table of contents higher reservation and other services revenues 
during the year ended december   our reservation revenues increased primarily due to the termination  effective december   of reduced tariff rates to certain customers under the terms of epng s ferc approved systemwide capacity allocation proceeding  an increase in epng s tariff rates which are subject to refund and which became effective on january   sales of additional firm capacity and higher realized rates on several of our pipeline systems compared to in addition  our usage revenues increased due to increased activity on our pipeline systems under various interruptible services provided under their tariffs as a result of favorable market conditions 
gas not used in operations  revaluations  processing revenues and other natural gas sales 
during  higher realized prices on sales of gas not used in operations resulted in favorable impacts to our operating revenues  partially offset by lower sales volumes of natural gas during compared to we also experienced favorable impacts to our operating expenses in due to decreases in the index prices used to value the net imbalance position on several of our pipeline systems 
in  higher gas prices caused an increase in our obligation to replace system gas and settle gas imbalances in the future  resulting in an unfavorable impact on our operating results 
in addition  our pipelines also retained lower volumes of gas not used in operations during we anticipate that the overall activity in this area will continue to vary based on factors such as regulatory actions  some of which have already been implemented  the efficiency of our pipeline operations  natural gas prices and other factors 
expansions 
below is a discussion of i our ferc approved expansion projects placed in service and ii other ferc approved expansion projects not yet completed which we are in various stages of certification and approval 
projects placed in service 
during and  we placed several significant expansion projects in service including cheyenne plains  the elba island lng expansion  the raton basin project and the piceance basin project and related compression on our wic system 
projects not yet completed 
anticipated completion estimated project or in service date cost estimated future revenues louisiana deepwater link july million triple t extension september million essex middlesex project november million million in million annually thereafter northeast connexion new england november million million in million annually thereafter cypress expansion may million million annually estimate reflects anticipated payment of approximately million in contributions to a third party 
revenues for these projects will be based on throughput levels as natural gas reserves are developed 
amount shown is net of anticipated the receipt of approximately million in contributions in aid of construction 
project will consist of three phases 
the anticipated completion date is related to phase hurricanes katrina and rita 
during and  we recorded higher operation and maintenance expenses as a result of unreimbursed amounts expended to repair damage caused by hurricanes katrina and rita in for a further discussion of the impact of these hurricanes on our capital expenditures  see capital resources and liquidity below 
impairment of pipeline development projects 
during and  we impaired various pipeline development projects based on changing market conditions 
in  we recorded impairments of million and million due to discontinuing our continental connector pipeline project and the remainder of our seafarer project 
in  we recorded impairments of million and million due to discontinuing a portion of our seafarer project and the entirety of our blue atlantic development project 
general and administrative expenses 
during the year ended december   our general and administrative costs were lower than  primarily due to a decrease in accrued benefit costs and lower allocated costs from el paso 
during the year ended december   our general and administrative costs were higher 
table of contents than in  primarily due to an increase in direct payroll related benefits for our employees  higher legal and insurance costs of  and higher corporate overhead allocations from el paso 
el paso s allocation to us increased in based on the estimated level of resources devoted to our segment s operations and the relative size of our ebit  gross property and payroll as compared to the consolidated totals 
higher depreciation expense 
depreciation expense was higher for compared to primarily due to higher depreciation rates applied to epng s property  plant and equipment following the effective date of its rate case 
pipeline integrity costs 
as of january   we adopted an accounting release issued by the ferc that requires us to expense certain costs our interstate pipelines incur related to their pipeline integrity programs 
prior to adoption  we capitalized these costs as part of our property  plant and equipment 
operating costs 
during  we incurred higher costs primarily for repairs and maintenance 
during and  we incurred higher costs for compressor engine repair and preventive maintenance  lowering of lines and pipeline integrity testing as well as higher legal and environmental reserves 
enron bankruptcy settlement 
during  we recorded income of approximately million  net of amounts potentially owed to certain customers  associated with the receipt of settlement proceeds related to the enron bankruptcy 
we may receive additional amounts in the future as settlement proceeds are released by the bankruptcy court 
regulatory matters rate cases 
our pipeline systems periodically file for changes in their rates  which are subject to the approval of the ferc 
changes in rates and other tariff provisions resulting from these regulatory proceedings have the potential to positively or negatively impact our profitability 
currently  certain of our pipelines have no requirements to file new rate cases and expect to continue operating under their existing rates 
however  certain other pipelines listed below are currently in rate proceedings or have upcoming rate actions 
epng epng negotiated a settlement of its rate case that was filed with the ferc in december the settlement provides benefits for both epng and its customers for a three year period ending december  for a further discussion of this settlement  see
