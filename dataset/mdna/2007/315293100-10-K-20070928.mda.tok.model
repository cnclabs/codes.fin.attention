our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relates to ferrellgas partners lp and the operating partnership 
ferrellgas partners finance corp 
and ferrellgas finance corp 
have nominal assets  do not conduct any operations and have no employees 
ferrellgas partners finance corp 
serves as co obligor for debt securities of ferrellgas partners and ferrellgas finance corp 
serves as co obligor for debt securities of the operating partnership 
accordingly  and due to the reduced disclosure format  a discussion of the results of operations  liquidity and capital resources of ferrellgas partners finance corp 
and ferrellgas finance corp 
is not presented in this section 
the following is a discussion of our historical financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the discussions set forth in the results of operations and liquidity and capital resources sections generally refer to ferrellgas partners and its consolidated subsidiaries 
however  in these discussions there exists two material differences between ferrellgas partners and the operating partnership 
those material differences are because ferrellgas partners issued million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due fiscal  the two partnerships incur different amounts of interest expense on their outstanding indebtedness  see the statements of earnings in their respective consolidated financial statements and notes j long term debt in the respective notes to their consolidated financial statements  and ferrellgas partners issued common units in several transactions during fiscal and fiscal overview we are a leading distributor of propane and related equipment and supplies to customers primarily in the united states 
we believe that we are the second largest retail marketer of propane in the united states  including the largest national provider of propane by portable tank exchange as measured by our propane sales volumes in fiscal we serve more than one million residential  industrial commercial  propane tank exchange  agricultural and other customers in all states  the district of columbia and puerto rico 
our operations primarily include the distribution and sale of propane and related equipment and supplies with concentrations in the midwest  southeast  southwest and northwest regions of the country 
the market for propane is seasonal because of increased demand during the winter months primarily for the purpose of providing heating in residential and commercial buildings 
consequently  sales and operating profits are concentrated in our second and third fiscal quarters  which are during the winter heating season of november through march 
however  the propane by portable tank exchanges sales volume provides us increased operating profits during our first and fourth fiscal quarters due to its counter seasonal business activities 
it also provides us the ability to better utilize our seasonal resources at our retail distribution locations 
other factors affecting our results of operations include competitive conditions  energy commodity prices  demand for propane  timing of acquisitions and general economic conditions in the united states 
we use information on temperatures to understand how our results of operations are affected by temperatures that are warmer or colder than normal 
we use the definition of normal temperatures based on information published by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa 
based on this information we calculate a ratio of actual heating degree days to normal heating degree days 
heating degree days are a general indicator of weather impacting propane usage 
weather conditions have a significant impact on demand for propane for heating purposes during the winter heating season of november through march 
accordingly  the volume of propane used by our customers for this purpose is directly affected by the severity of the winter weather in the regions we serve and can vary substantially from year to year 
in any given region  sustained warmer than normal temperatures will tend to result in reduced propane use  while sustained colder than normal temperatures will tend to result in greater use 
our gross margin from propane and other gas liquids sales is primarily based on the cents per gallon difference between the sale price we charge our customers and our costs to purchase and deliver propane to our propane distribution locations 
our residential customers and portable tank exchange customers typically provide us a greater cents per gallon margin than our industrial commercial  agricultural and other customers 
the wholesale propane price per gallon is subject to various market conditions and may fluctuate based on changes in demand  supply and other energy commodity prices  primarily crude oil and natural gas as propane prices tend to correlate with the fluctuations of these underlying commodities 
we employ risk management activities that attempt to mitigate risks related to the purchasing and transporting of propane 
we continue to pursue the following business strategies maximize operating efficiencies through utilization of our technology platform  capitalize on our national presence and economies of scale  expand our operations through disciplined acquisitions and internal growth  and align employee interest with our investors through significant employee ownership 
net earnings in fiscal was million compared to net earnings in fiscal of million 
the increase in net earnings of million was primarily due to the following gross margin from propane and other gas liquids sales increased million primarily due to higher average propane margins per gallon  temperatures which were colder than the prior year  and acquisitions completed within the last months  operating expense increased million primarily due to continued tank exchange growth and acquisitions completed within the last months 
interest expense increased million primarily due to increased borrowings on our unsecured bank credit facilities primarily to fund acquisitions and growth capital expenditures 
loss on disposal of assets and other increased million primarily due to a loss on the sale of non strategic assets in the current year as well as a gain on the sale of non strategic assets in the prior year that was not repeated in the current year 
on july   we sold certain non strategic storage and terminal assets located in arizona  kansas  minnesota  north carolina and utah 
we consider the sale of these assets to be discontinued operations 
the proceeds from this sale were used to retire a portion of our long term debt including accrued interest and a portion of our borrowings outstanding on our bank credit facility 
forward looking statements statements included in this report include forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are identified as any statement that does not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
they often use words such as anticipate  believe  intend  plan  projection  forecast  strategy  position  continue  estimate  expect  may  will  or the negative of those terms or other variations of them or comparable terminology 
these statements often discuss plans  strategies  events or developments that we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future and are based upon the beliefs and assumptions of our management and on the information currently available to them 
in particular  statements  express or implied  concerning future operating results or our ability to generate sales  income or cash flow are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are not guarantees of performance 
you should not put undue reliance on any forward looking statements 
all forward looking statements are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by these forward looking statements 
many of the factors that will affect our future results are beyond our ability to control or predict 
some of our forward looking statements include the following whether the operating partnership will have sufficient funds to meet its obligations  including its obligations under its debt securities  and to enable it to distribute to ferrellgas partners sufficient funds to permit ferrellgas partners to meet its obligations with respect to its existing debt and equity securities  whether ferrellgas partners and the operating partnership will continue to meet all of the quarterly financial tests required by the agreements governing their indebtedness  and the expectation that revenues propane and other liquids sales  cost of product sold propane and other gas liquids  gross margin propane and other gas liquids  operating income and earnings from continuing operations will increase in fiscal when considering any forward looking statement  you should also keep in mind the risk factors in item a 
risk factors 
any of these risks could impair our business  financial condition or results of operations 
any such impairment may affect our ability to make distributions to our unitholders or pay interest on the principal of any of our debt securities 
in addition  the trading price  if any  of our securities could decline as a result of any such impairment 
except for our ongoing obligations to disclose material information as required by federal securities laws  we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statements or risk factors after the date of this annual report 
in addition  the classification of ferrellgas partners and the operating partnership as partnerships for federal income tax purposes means that we do not generally pay federal income taxes 
we do  however  pay taxes on the income of our subsidiaries that are corporations 
we rely on a legal opinion from our counsel  and not a ruling from the internal revenue service  as to our proper classification for federal income tax purposes 
see the section entitled item a 
risk factors tax risks the irs could treat us as a corporation for tax purposes  which would substantially reduce the cash available for distribution to our unitholders

propane sales volumes during fiscal were million gallons less than the prior year period 
although temperatures during fiscal were colder than the prior year period  we believe consistently high propane prices have led to continued customer conservation that more than offset this colder weather and gallons gained through acquisitions completed during the last twelve months 
although the wholesale market price of propane has remained consistent since the prior year period  the wholesale market price has increased since fiscal the wholesale market price per gallon at one of the major supply points  mt 
belvieu  texas  averaged and per gallon during fiscal and  respectively  compared to an average of per gallon during fiscal propane and other gas liquids sales increased million compared to the prior year period 
this increase was primarily due to colder weather as discussed above  approximately million related to the effect of increased sales prices per gallon  approximately million related to acquisitions completed during the last twelve months and approximately million related to an increase in lower margin wholesale and other third party sales 
we believe these increases were partially offset by customer conservation  as discussed above 
gross margin from propane and other gas liquids increased million compared to the prior year period 
approximately million related to improved margins per gallon and approximately million related to acquisitions completed during the last twelve months 
we believe these increases together with the effect of colder weather were partially offset by customer conservation  both as discussed above 
operating income increased million compared to the prior year period primarily due to the previously mentioned gross margin from propane and other gas liquids sales which increased approximately million 
this increase in operating income was partially offset by a million increase in operating expenses and a million increase in loss on disposal of assets and other 
operating expense increased primarily due to continued tank exchange growth and acquisitions completed during the last twelve months 
loss on disposal of assets and other increased primarily due to a loss on the sale of non strategic assets in the current year as well as a gain on the sale of non strategic assets in the prior year period that was not repeated during the current year period 
interest expense increased million compared to the prior year period primarily due to increased borrowings on our unsecured bank credit facilities primarily to fund acquisition and growth capital expenditures  partially offset by retirement of a portion of our fixed rate senior notes during the first quarter of fiscal interest expense of the operating partnership interest expense increased million compared to the prior year primarily due to increased borrowings on our unsecured bank credit facilities primarily to fund acquisition and growth capital expenditures  partially offset by retirement of a portion of our fixed rate senior notes during the first quarter of fiscal forward looking statements 
we expect increases in fiscal for revenue propane and other gas liquids sales  cost of product sold propane and other gas liquids sales  gross margin propane and other gas liquids sales  operating income and net earnings as compared to fiscal due to our assumption that interest rates will remain relatively stable in fiscal  our assumption that weather will remain close to normal during fiscal  and our assumption that propane sales volumes will increase in fiscal fiscal year ended july  vs 
july  increase percentage decrease change amounts in thousands propane sales volumes gallons propane and other gas liquids sales gross margin from propane and other gas liquids sales a operating income interest expense a gross margin from propane and other gas liquids sales represents propane and other gas liquids sales less cost of product sold propane and other gas liquids sales 
propane sales volumes during fiscal decreased million gallons compared to the prior year period primarily due to customer conservation caused by higher commodity prices and warmer than normal temperatures  partially offset by gallons acquired through acquisitions completed during fiscal and and continued tank exchange gallon growth 
heating degree days  as reported by noaa  were warmer than normal during fiscal compared to being warmer than normal during fiscal propane and other gas liquids sales and the related cost of product sold increased due to the effect of a significant increase in the wholesale cost of propane during fiscal as compared to the prior year period 
the wholesale market price per gallon at one of the major supply points  mt 
belvieu  texas  averaged per gallon during fiscal  compared to an average of per gallon in the prior year period 
other major supply points in the united states have also experienced significant increases 
propane and other gas liquids sales increased million compared to the prior year period 
approximately million of this increase was primarily due to the effect of the significant increase in the wholesale cost per gallon of propane on our sales price per gallon  as discussed above  and  to a lesser extent  continued tank exchange gallon growth 
this increase was partially offset by the impact from decreased propane sales volumes and warmer than normal weather  as discussed above 
gross margin from propane and other gas liquids increased million compared to the prior year period 
the increase in gross profit was primarily due to higher average propane margins per gallon provided by enhanced controls over pricing attributable to our new technology platform completed during the first month of fiscal  the continued growth in tank exchange volumes and acquisitions completed during fiscal and these increases in gross margin from propane and other gas liquids were partially offset by the impact from decreased propane sales volumes  as discussed above 
also contributing to the increased gross margin was the prior year period s million negative contribution to gross margin during fiscal related to risk management trading activities that was not repeated during fiscal operating income increased million compared to the prior year period primarily due to the previously mentioned increase in gross margin from propane and other gas liquids  which was partially offset by an million increase in operating expense and a million increase in general and administrative expense 
operating expense increased due to variable expenses primarily related to the continued growth of tank exchange gallons  increased fuel costs  performance based compensation  acquisitions completed during fiscal and and internal growth 
the increase in operating expense was partially offset by personnel savings related to the deployment of our new technology platform discussed above 
general and administrative expense increased primarily due to a non cash compensation expense related to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r and performance based compensation expense 
interest expense decreased million compared to the prior year primarily due to the retirement of a portion of our fixed rate senior notes during the fourth quarter of fiscal interest expense of the operating partnership interest expense decreased million compared to the prior year primarily due to the retirement of a portion of our fixed rate senior notes during the fourth quarter of fiscal discontinued operations on july   we announced the closing of the sale of certain non strategic storage and terminal assets located in arizona  kansas  minnesota  north carolina and utah receiving approximately million in cash 
we recorded a gain of million on the sale 
we consider the sale of these assets to be discontinued operations and have reported results of operations from these assets as discontinued operations for all periods presented on the consolidated statements of earnings 
see note e discontinued operations to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion about the sale of these assets 
operating results of discontinued operations are as follows for the year ended july  amounts in thousands total revenues cost of product sold propane and gas liquids sales operating expense depreciation and amortization expense equipment lease expense loss on disposal of assets and other earnings before income taxes  minority interest and discontinued operations minority interest gain on sale of discontinued operations earnings from discontinued operations  net of minority interest liquidity and capital resources our cash requirements include working capital requirements  debt service payments  the minimum quarterly common unit distribution  acquisition and capital expenditures 
the minimum quarterly distribution of was paid on september  to all common units that were outstanding on september   and represents the fifty second consecutive minimum quarterly distribution paid to our common unitholders dating back to october our working capital requirements are subject to  among other things  the price of propane  delays in the collection of receivables  volatility in energy commodity prices  liquidity imposed by insurance providers  downgrades in our credit ratings  decreased trade credit  significant acquisitions  the weather and other changes in the demand for propane 
relatively colder weather and higher propane prices during the winter heating season are factors that could significantly increase our working capital requirements 
our ability to satisfy our obligations is dependent upon future performance  which will be subject to prevailing economic  financial  business  weather conditions and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
due to the seasonality of the retail propane distribution business  a significant portion of our cash flow from operations is generated during the winter heating season  which occurs during our second and third fiscal quarters 
our net cash provided by operating activities primarily reflects earnings from our business activities adjusted for depreciation and amortization and changes in our working capital accounts 
historically  we generate significantly lower net cash from operating activities in our first and fourth fiscal quarters as compared to our second and third fiscal quarters because fixed costs generally exceed revenues and related costs and expenses during the non peak heating season 
subject to meeting the financial tests discussed below  our general partner believes that the operating partnership will have sufficient funds available to meet its obligations  and to distribute to ferrellgas partners sufficient funds to permit ferrellgas partners to meet its obligations for fiscal and in addition  our general partner believes that the operating partnership will have sufficient funds available to distribute to ferrellgas partners sufficient cash to pay the minimum quarterly distribution on all of its common units for fiscal and our bank credit facilities  public debt  private debt and accounts receivable securitization facility contain several financial tests and covenants restricting our ability to pay distributions  incur debt and engage in certain other business transactions 
in general  these tests are based on our debt to cash flow ratio and cash flow to interest expense ratio 
our general partner currently believes that the most restrictive of these tests are debt incurrence limitations under the terms of our bank credit and accounts receivable securitization facilities and limitations on the payment of distributions within our senior notes due the bank credit and accounts receivable securitization facilities generally limit the operating partnership s ability to incur debt if it exceeds prescribed ratios of either debt to cash flow or cash flow to interest expense 
our senior notes restrict payments if a minimum ratio of cash flow to interest expense is not met  assuming certain exceptions to this ratio limit have previously been exhausted 
this restriction places limitations on our ability to make restricted payments such as the payment of cash distributions to unitholders 
the cash flow used to determine these financial tests generally is based upon our most recent cash flow performance giving pro forma effect for acquisitions and divestitures made during the test period 
our bank credit facilities  public debt  private debt and accounts receivable securitization facility do not contain early repayment provisions related to a potential decline in our credit rating 
as of july   we met all the required quarterly financial tests and covenants 
based upon current estimates of our future cash flow  our general partner believes that we will be able to continue to meet all of the required quarterly financial tests and covenants for fiscal and however  we may not meet the applicable financial tests in future quarters if we were to experience significantly warmer than normal winter temperatures  a continued volatile energy commodity cost environment  an unexpected downturn in business operations  or a general economic downturn in the united states 
this failure could have a materially adverse effect on our operating capacity and cash flows and could restrict our ability to incur debt or to make cash distributions to our unitholders  even if sufficient funds were available 
depending on the circumstances  we may consider alternatives to permit the incurrence of debt or the continued payment of the quarterly cash distribution to our unitholders 
no assurances can be given  however  that such alternatives can or will be implemented with respect to any given quarter 
we expect our future capital expenditures  working capital and debt service needs to be provided by a combination of cash generated from future operations  existing cash balances  our bank credit facilities or our accounts receivable securitization facility 
see additional information about our accounts receivable securitization facility in operating activities accounts receivable securitization 
in order to reduce existing indebtedness  fund future acquisitions and expansive capital projects  we may obtain funds from our facilities  we may issue additional debt to the extent permitted under existing financing arrangements or we may issue additional equity securities  including  among others  common units 
toward this purpose  the following registration statements were effective upon filing or declared effective by the sec a shelf registration statement for the periodic sale of common units  debt securities  and or other securities 
ferrellgas partners finance corp 
may  at our election  be the co obligor on any debt securities issued by ferrellgas partners under this shelf registration statement  an acquisition shelf registration statement for the periodic sale of up to million of common units to fund acquisitions 
as of august   we had million available under this shelf registration statement  and a shelf registration statement for the periodic sale of up to million of common units in connection with the ferrellgas partners direct purchase and distribution reinvestment plan 
as of august  we had million available under this shelf agreement 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the prior year period 
this increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to cash inflows of approximately million related to the timing of inventory purchases  approximately million related to the timing of accounts receivable collections and approximately million from improved results of operations as discussed above 
these cash inflows were partially offset by cash outflows of approximately million related to the timing of accounts payable disbursements  approximately million related to the timing of customer deposit reimbursements  and approximately million due to net cash decreases from the utilization of our accounts receivable securitization facility 
accounts receivable securitization cash flows from our accounts receivable securitization facility decreased million primarily because more of our working capital needs were funded by improved results from operations 
we contributed net funding of million to this facility during fiscal  compared to receiving net funding of million in the prior year period 
our strategy for obtaining liquidity at the lowest cost of capital is to initially utilize the accounts receivable securitization facility before borrowings under the operating partnership s bank credit facilities 
see additional discussion about the operating partnership s bank credit facilities in financing activities bank credit facilities 
our utilization of the accounts receivable securitization facility is limited by the amount of accounts receivable that we are permitted to transfer according to the facility agreement 
this arrangement allows for the proceeds of up to million from the sale of accounts receivable  depending upon the timing of the year and available undivided interests in our accounts receivable from certain customers 
we renewed this facility effective may   for a day commitment with jpmorgan chase bank  n 
a and fifth third bank 
at july   we had transferred million of our trade accounts receivable with the ability to transfer  at our option  an additional million to the accounts receivable securitization facility 
as our trade accounts receivable increase during the winter heating season  the accounts receivable securitization facility permits us to transfer additional trade accounts receivable to the facility  thereby providing additional cash for working capital needs 
this transaction is reflected in our consolidated financial statements as a sale of accounts receivable and a retained interest in transferred accounts receivable 
the operating partnership net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the prior year period 
this increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to cash inflows of approximately million related to the timing of inventory purchases  approximately million related to the timing of accounts receivable collections and approximately million from improved results of operations 
these cash inflows were partially offset by cash outflows of approximately million related to the timing of accounts payable disbursements  approximately million related to the timing of customer deposit reimbursements  and approximately million due to net cash decreases from the utilization of our accounts receivable securitization facility 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal  compared to net cash used in investing activities of million for the prior year period 
capital expenditures we incurred capital expenditures of million during fiscal as compared to million in the prior year period primarily due to increased growth and maintenance expenditures 
we lease property  computer equipment  propane tanks  light and medium duty trucks  truck tractors and transport trailers 
we believe leasing is a cost effective method for meeting our equipment needs 
during fiscal  we purchased million of vehicles whose lease terms expired during the period 
acquisitions during fiscal  we used million in cash for the acquisition of nine propane businesses as compared to million in cash in the prior year period 
financing activities during fiscal  net cash used in financing activities was million compared to net cash used in financing activities of million for the prior year period 
this increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to cash outflows related to net reductions of long term debt and short term borrowings which were partially offset by increased cash inflows from the issuance of common units 
common unit issuance during the first quarter of fiscal  we received proceeds of million  net of issuance costs  from the issuance of million common units to ferrell companies pursuant to ferrellgas partners direct investment plan and general partner contributions 
we used the net proceeds to reduce borrowings on our unsecured back credit facility 
distributions we paid the minimum quarterly distributions on all common units  as well as general partner interests  totaling million during fiscal in connection with the distributions declared for the three months ended july   october   january   and april  the minimum quarterly distribution on all common units and related general partner distributions for the three months ended july  of million was paid on september  to holders of record on september  on august   ferrellgas made scheduled principal payments of million of the series b senior notes using proceeds from borrowings on the unsecured bank credit facilities 
bank credit facilities during august  we executed a commitment increase agreement to our existing unsecured bank credit facility  which will mature april   unless extended or renewed  increasing the borrowing capacity from million to million 
during may  we entered into a new unsecured bank credit facility with additional borrowing capacity of up to million which will mature on august   unless extended or renewed 
at july   million of borrowings and million of letters of credit were outstanding under our unsecured bank credit facilities 
letters of credit are currently used to cover obligations primarily relating to requirements for insurance coverage and  to a lesser extent  risk management activities and product purchases 
at july   we had million available for working capital  acquisition  capital expenditure and general partnership purposes under our unsecured bank credit facilities 
all borrowings under our unsecured bank credit facilities bear interest  at our option  at a rate equal to either a base rate  which is defined as the higher of the federal funds rate plus or bank of america s prime rate as of july   the federal funds rate and bank of america s prime rate were and  respectively  or the eurodollar rate plus a margin varying from to as of july   the one month and three month eurodollar rate was and  respectively 
in addition  an annual commitment fee is payable on the daily unused portion of our unsecured bank credit facilities at a per annum rate varying from to as of july   the commitment fee per annum rate was 
we believe that the liquidity available from our unsecured bank credit facilities and our accounts receivable securitization facility will be sufficient to meet our future capital expenditures  working capital  debt service and letter of credit requirements for fiscal and see operating activities for discussion about our accounts receivable securitization facility 
however  if we were to experience an unexpected significant increase in these requirements  our needs could exceed our immediately available resources 
events that could cause increases in these requirements include  but are not limited to the following a significant increase in the wholesale cost of propane  a significant delay in the collections of accounts receivable  increased volatility in energy commodity prices related to risk management activities  increased liquidity requirements imposed by insurance providers  a significant downgrade in our credit rating  decreased trade credit  or a significant acquisition 
if one or more of these or other events caused a significant use of available funding  we may consider alternatives to provide increased liquidity and capital funding 
no assurances can be given  however  that such alternatives would be available  or  if available  could be implemented 
the operating partnership the financing activities discussed above also apply to the operating partnership except for cash flows related to distributions and contributions received  as discussed below 
distributions paid by the operating partnership the operating partnership paid quarterly distributions totaling million during fiscal to ferrellgas partners  lp and our general partner 
on september   the operating partnership paid a cash distribution to ferrellgas partners and our general partner totaling million 
contributions received by the operating partnership on august   the operating partnership received cash contributions of million and million from ferrellgas partners and the general partner  respectively  primarily in connection with the issuance by ferrellgas partners of million common units to ferrell companies

our off balance sheet arrangements also include the leasing of transportation equipment  property  computer equipment and propane tanks 
we account for these arrangements as operating leases 
we believe these arrangements are a cost effective method for financing our equipment needs 
these off balance sheet arrangements enable us to lease equipment from third parties rather than  among other options  purchasing the equipment using on balance sheet financing 
most of the operating leases involving our transportation equipment contain residual value guarantees 
these transportation equipment lease arrangements are scheduled to expire over the next seven years 
most of these arrangements provide that the fair value of the equipment will equal or exceed a guaranteed amount  or we will be required to pay the lessor the difference 
although the fair values at the end of the lease terms have historically exceeded these guaranteed amounts  the maximum potential amount of aggregate future payments we could be required to make under these leasing arrangements  assuming the equipment is worthless at the end of the lease term  was million as of july  we do not know of any event  demand  commitment  trend or uncertainty that would result in a material change to these arrangements 
adoption of new accounting standards below is a listing of recently issued accounting pronouncements that relate to us 
none of these pronouncements have or are expected to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows

fiscal years beginning after december  critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
these financial statements include some estimates and assumptions that are based on informed judgments and estimates of management 
we evaluate our policies and estimates on an on going basis and discuss the development  selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors of our general partner 
predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and as such requires the use of judgment 
our consolidated financial statements may differ based upon different estimates and assumptions 
we discuss our significant accounting policies in note b summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are subject to judgments and uncertainties that affect the application of such policies 
we believe these financial statements include the most likely outcomes with regard to amounts that are based on our judgment and estimates 
our financial position and results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from the actual amounts  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements due to the estimation process and business judgment involved in their application depreciation of property  plant and equipment we calculate depreciation on property  plant and equipment using the straight line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from two to years 
changes in the estimated useful lives of our property  plant and equipment could have a material effect on our results of operations 
the estimates of the assets useful lives require our judgment regarding assumptions about the useful life of the assets being depreciated 
when necessary  the assets are revised and the impact on depreciation is treated on a prospective basis 
residual value of customer and storage tanks we use an estimated residual value when calculating depreciation for our customer and bulk storage tanks 
customer and bulk storage tanks are classified as property  plant and equipment on our consolidated balance sheets 
the depreciable basis of these tanks is calculated using the original cost less the residual value 
depreciation is calculated using straight line method based on the tanks estimated useful life of years 
changes in the estimated residual value could have a material effect on our results of operations 
the estimates of the tanks residual value require our judgment of the value of the tanks at the end of their useful life or retirement 
when necessary  the tanks residual values are revised and the impact on depreciation is treated on a prospective basis 
valuation methods  amortization methods and estimated useful lives of intangible assets the specific  identifiable intangible assets of a business enterprise depend largely upon the nature of its operations 
potential intangible assets include intellectual property such as trademarks and trade names  customer lists and relationships  and non compete agreements  as well as other intangible assets 
the approach to the valuation of each intangible asset will vary depending upon the nature of the asset  the business in which it is utilized  and the economic returns it is generating or is expected to generate 
during fiscal we did not find it necessary to adjust the valuation methods used for any acquired intangible assets 
our recorded intangible assets primarily include the estimated value assigned to certain customer related and contract based assets representing the rights we own arising from the acquisition of propane distribution companies and related contractual agreements 
a customer related or contract based intangible with a finite useful life is amortized over its estimated useful life  which is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the entity 
we believe that trademarks and tradenames have an indefinite useful life due to our intention to utilize all acquired trademarks and tradenames 
when necessary  the intangible assets useful lives are revised and the impact on amortization will be reflected on a prospective basis 
the determination of the fair market value of the intangible asset and the estimated useful life are based on an analysis of all pertinent factors including the use of widely accepted valuation approaches  the income approach or the cost approach  the expected use of the asset by the entity  the expected useful life of related assets  any legal  regulatory or contractual provisions  including renewal or extension periods that would not cause substantial costs or modifications to existing agreements  the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition  and other economic factors and the level of maintenance required to obtain the expected future cash flows 
if the underlying assumption s governing the amortization of an intangible asset were later determined to have significantly changed either favorably or unfavorably  then we may be required to adjust the amortization period of such asset to reflect any new estimate of its useful life 
such a change would increase or decrease the annual amortization charge associated with the asset at that time 
during fiscal  we did not find it necessary to adjust the valuation method  estimated useful life or amortization period of any of our intangible assets 
should any of the underlying assumptions indicate that the value of the intangible asset might be impaired  we may be required to reduce the carrying value and subsequent useful life of the asset 
any such write down of the value and unfavorable change in the useful life ie  amortization period of an intangible asset would increase operating costs and expenses at that time 
at july  and  the carrying value of our intangible asset portfolio was million and million  respectively 
we did not recognize any impairment losses related to our intangible assets during fiscal or for additional information regarding our intangible assets  see note b summary of significant accounting policies and note i goodwill and intangible assets  net to our consolidated financial statements 
fair value of derivative commodity contracts we enter into commodity forward  futures  swaps and options contracts involving propane and related products to hedge exposures to product purchase price risk 
in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  these contracts are accounted for using the fair value method 
under this valuation method  derivatives are carried in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with changes in value recognized in cost of product sold in the consolidated statements of earnings or in other comprehensive income in the consolidated statement of partners capital 
we utilize published settlement prices for exchange traded contracts  quotes provided by brokers and estimates of market prices based on daily contract activity to estimate the fair value of these contracts 
changes in the methods used to determine the fair value of these contracts could have a material effect on our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of earnings 
for further discussion of derivative commodity contracts  see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  note b summary of significant accounting policies and note l derivatives to our consolidated financial statements 
we do not anticipate future changes in the methods used to determine the fair value of these derivative contracts 
unit and stock based compensation we utilize a binomial option valuation tool to compute an estimated fair value of option awards at their grant date 
this option valuation tool requires a number of inputs  some of which require an estimate to be made by management 
significant estimates include our computation of volatility  the number of groups of employees  the expected term of awards and the forfeiture rate of awards our stock based awards plan grants stock awards out of ferrell companies 
ferrell companies is not a publicly traded company and management does not believe it belongs to a certain industry group 
as a result  our volatility computation is highly subjective 
if a different volatility factor were used  it could significantly change the fair value assigned to stock based awards at their grant date 
due to the limited number of employees eligible to participate in our unit and stock based compensation plans  management believes we have only one group of employees 
if a determination were made that we have multiple groups of employees  that determination could significantly change the expected term and forfeiture rate assigned to our unit and stock based awards 
during fiscal we changed our method for computing the expected term of our unit and stock based awards from the simplified method to a method that utilizes historical exercise patterns to estimate the term of our unit and stock based awards 
this change did not have a significant effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
this method could assign a term to our unit and stock based awards that is significantly different from their actual terms  which could result in a significant difference in the fair value assigned to the awards at the grant date 
we utilize historical forfeiture rates to estimate the expected forfeiture rates on our unit and stock based awards grant dates 
if actual forfeiture rates were to differ significantly from our estimates  it could result in significant differences between actual and reported compensation expense for our unit and stock based awards 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our risk management trading activities include the use of energy commodity forward contracts  swaps and options traded on the over the counter financial markets and futures and options traded on the new york mercantile exchange 
these risk management activities are conducted primarily to offset the effect of market price fluctuations on propane inventory and purchase commitments and to mitigate the price risk on sale commitments to our customers 
our risk management trading activities are intended to generate a profit  which we then apply to reduce our cost of product sold 
the results of our risk management activities directly related to the delivery of propane to our customers  which include our supply procurement  storage and transportation activities  are presented in our discussion of margins and are accounted for at cost 
the results of our other risk management activities are presented separately in our discussion of gross profit found in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations as risk management trading activities and are accounted for at fair value 
market risks associated with energy commodities are monitored daily by senior management for compliance with our commodity risk management policy 
this policy includes an aggregate dollar loss limit and limits on the term of various contracts 
we also utilize volume limits for various energy commodities and review our positions daily where we remain exposed to market risk  so as to manage exposures to changing market prices 
we did not enter into any significant risk management trading activities during fiscal our remaining market risk sensitive instruments and positions have been determined to be other than trading 
commodity price risk our risk management activities primarily attempt to mitigate risks related to the purchasing  storing and transporting of propane 
we generally purchase propane in the contract and spot markets from major domestic energy companies on a short term basis 
our costs to purchase and distribute propane fluctuate with the movement of market prices 
this fluctuation subjects us to potential price risk  which we attempt to minimize through the use of risk management activities 
our risk management activities include the use of forward contracts  futures  swaps and options to seek protection from adverse price movements and to minimize potential losses 
our hedging strategy involves taking positions in the forward or financial markets that are equal and opposite to our positions in the physical product markets in order to minimize the risk of financial loss from an adverse price change 
our hedging strategy is successful when our gains or losses in the physical product markets are offset by our losses or gains in the forward or financial markets 
market risks associated with energy commodities are monitored daily by senior management for compliance with our commodity risk management policy 
this policy includes an aggregate dollar loss limit and limits on the term of various contracts 
we also utilize volume limits for various energy commodities and review our positions daily where we remain exposed to market risk  so as to manage exposures to changing market prices 
we have prepared a sensitivity analysis to estimate the exposure to market risk of our energy commodity positions 
forward contracts  futures  swaps and options outstanding as of july  and  that were used in our risk management activities were analyzed assuming a hypothetical adverse change in prices for the delivery month for all energy commodities 
the potential loss in future earnings from these positions due to a adverse movement in market prices of the underlying energy commodities was estimated at million and million as of july  and  respectively 
the preceding hypothetical analysis is limited because changes in prices may or may not equal  thus actual results may differ 
our sensitivity analysis includes designated hedging and the anticipated transactions associated with these hedging transactions 
these hedging transactions are anticipated to be effective  therefore  there is no effect on our sensitivity analysis from these hedging transactions 
to the extent option contracts are used as hedging instruments for anticipated transactions we have included the offsetting effect of the anticipated transactions  only to the extent the option contracts are in the money  or would become in the money as a result of the hypothetical movement in prices 
all other anticipated transactions for risk management activities have been excluded from our sensitivity analysis 
interest rate risk at july  and  we had million and million  respectively  in borrowings on variable rate bank credit facilities 
thus  assuming a one percent increase in our variable interest rate  our interest rate risk related to the borrowings on our variable rate bank credit facilities would result in a loss in future earnings of million for fiscal the preceding hypothetical analysis is limited because changes in interest rates may or may not equal one percent  thus actual results may differ
