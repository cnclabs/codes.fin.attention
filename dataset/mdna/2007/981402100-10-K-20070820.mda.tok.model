our business changed significantly beginning in fiscal during fiscal  we completed the acquisitions of paula allen holdings  omnipartners  figurejobs 
com  rezlogic  resumexpress and tech engine 
during fiscal  we completed the acquisitions of icarian  purecarbon and xylo 
during fiscal  we completed the acquisitions of perform  peopleview and kadiri 
during fiscal  we completed the acquisitions of peoplebonus  bravanta  hrsoft and proact 
during fiscal  we acquired exxceed  inc these acquisitions have enabled us to expand and enhance our hcm software  increase our service offerings and increase our revenue streams 
subsequent to the acquisitions  we have concentrated on integrating the acquired entities and technologies  expanding the reach of the existing business and identifying other potential acquisition targets 
when we complete an acquisition  we combine the business of the acquired entity into the company s existing operations and expect that this will significantly reduce the administrative expenses associated with the business prior to the acquisition 
the acquired business is not maintained as a standalone business operation 
therefore  we do not separately account for the acquired business  including its profitability 
rather  it is included in one of our two distinct business segments and is evaluated as part of the entire segment 
over the past two years  we have expended significant resources on further development and integration of the acquired software applications 
we have enhanced product functionality  user interface and reporting capabilities 
we have further integrated many of the talent management solutions and provide a portal based platform for our customers who may elect to contract for a single solution or multiple applications 
in the latter part of fiscal  we set in motion a series of initiatives to help meet our strategic objective of becoming one of the premier providers of talent management solutions in the hcm space 
these initiatives entail further investment in product development  including the introduction of middle market talent management applications that are more suitable and cost effective for small to medium sized companies as well as further development of a more seamless integration between our core applications of compensation  performance and development 
we are also investing in making all our products very intuitive and easy to use leveraging web functionality 
we also have begun a rapid expansion and upgrade of our sales force and related sales support resources and plan to increase marketing expenditures in support of the sales effort 
in august of  we closed on a million equity financing to provide sufficient capital to fund these investments and support the operational needs of the business in the near term 
we believe that sound execution of these initiatives will result in accelerated revenue growth and the ability to take advantage of the scalable nature of our business model 
to monitor our results of operations and financial condition  we review key financial information including net revenues  gross profit  operating expenditure and cash flow from operations 
we have deployed numerous analytical dashboards across our business to assist in evaluating current performance against established metrics  budgets and business objectives on an ongoing basis 
we continue to seek methods to more efficiently monitor and manage our business performance 
critical accounting policies our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  the assessment of goodwill impairment  the valuation of acquired intangible assets  the assessment of intangible asset impairment and the valuation of deferred tax assets and related allowances 
management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the value of assets and the reported revenues 
changes in assumptions used would impact our financial position and results 
the company derives revenue from various sources including the following subscription and hosting fees  licensing of software and related maintenance fees  professional services related to software implementation  customization and training  sale of products and tickets through the company s employee discount and rewards software module  career transition services  recruitment research services  and  applicant sourcing 
in general  the company recognizes revenue when all of the revenue recognition criteria are met  which is typically when evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been provided or goods have been delivered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
the company primarily provides various hcm software applications as an on demand application service and also enters into the sale of license agreements 
revenue is generated through a variety of contractual arrangements 
subscription and hosting fees and software maintenance fees are billed in advance on a monthly  quarterly or annual basis 
amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue  depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
quarterly and annual payments are deferred and recognized monthly over the service period on a straight line basis 
set up fees are deferred and recognized monthly on a straight line basis over the contractual lives  which approximates the expected lives of the customer relationships 
subscription revenues and hosting fees consist of fees from customers accessing our on demand application service 
the company follows the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition and emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  the company allocates the total customer arrangement to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values  as determined by the price of the undelivered items when sold separately 
professional services included in an application services arrangement with multiple deliverables are accounted for separately when these services have value to the customer on a standalone basis  and there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of each deliverable of the arrangement 
when accounted for separately  revenues are recognized as the services are rendered 
license revenues consist of fees earned from the granting of licenses to use the software products 
the company recognizes revenue from the sale of software licenses in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  and sop no 
 modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  when all of the following conditions are met a signed contract exists  the software has been shipped or electronically delivered  the license fee is fixed or determinable  and the company believes that the collection of the fees is reasonably assured 
license revenue is recorded upon delivery with an appropriate deferral for maintenance services  if applicable  provided all of the other relevant conditions have been met 
the total fee from the arrangement is allocated based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of each of the undelivered elements 
maintenance agreements are typically priced based on a percentage of the product license fee and are either multi year or have a one year term  renewable annually 
vsoe of fair value for maintenance is established based on the stated renewal rates 
services provided to customers under maintenance agreements include technical product support and unspecified product upgrades 
vsoe of fair value for the professional service element is based on the standard hourly rates the company charges for services when such services are sold separately 
professional services revenue is generated from implementation of software applications and from customer training  customization and general consulting 
in addition  revenue is generated from technical support not included in the software maintenance 
the majority of professional services revenue is billed based on an hourly rate and recognized on a monthly basis as services are provided 
for certain contracts which involve significant implementation or other services which are essential to the functionality of the software and which are reasonably estimable  the license and implementation services revenue is recognized using contract accounting  as prescribed by sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
revenue is recognized over the period of each implementation using the percentage of completion method 
labor hours incurred is used as the measure of progress towards completion  and management believes its estimates to completion are reasonably dependable 
a provision for estimated losses on engagements is made in the period in which the losses become probable and can be reasonably estimated 
one of the software applications offered by the company allows customers to offer rewards  employee recognition and benefits discounted goods and tickets in an effort to promote their employee retention

the company recognizes revenue when all of the revenue recognition criteria are met  which is typically when the services have been completed 
goodwill is assessed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances warrant 
we assess goodwill related to reporting units for impairment and write down the carrying amount of goodwill as required 
we have two distinct reporting units enterprise workforce services and career networks 
each reporting unit represents a distinct business unit that offers different products and services 
management monitors each unit separately 
enterprise workforce services  which includes revenue from software and related services  is still considered a developing business unit  whereas career networks is a more established business unit 
we estimate the fair value of each business unit by preparing a discounted cash flow model  using a discount rate 
the model is prepared by projecting results for five years making different assumptions for each reporting unit 
for the calculation done at the end of fiscal  we estimated that individual reporting unit annual revenue growth rates would range from to  that gross profit would increase slightly  and that operating expenses would increase but would decrease as a percentage of revenues 
we estimated the terminal rate as a multiple of revenue after the fifth year to be between and an impairment charge is recorded if the implied fair value of goodwill of a reporting unit is less than the book value of goodwill for that unit 
changes in the discount rate used  or in other assumptions in the model  would result in wide fluctuations in the value of goodwill that is supported 
any such changes may result in additional impairment write downs 
we value acquired intangible assets  which includes acquired technologies  customer base and intellectual property  based on the estimated fair value of the assets at the time of the acquisition 
the estimated fair value is primarily based on projected cash flows associated with the assets and the customer attrition rates 
different assumptions were used in estimating the intangible assets acquired in each business acquisition 
if the future cash flows or the customer attrition rates differ significantly from our estimates  we may be required to record an impairment of intangible assets 
changes in circumstances impacting other assumptions used to value intangible assets could also lead to future impairments 
we apply significant judgment in recording deferred tax assets  which primarily are the result of loss carry forwards of companies that we acquired and loss carry forwards internally generated 
in addition  we make certain assumptions about if and when these deferred tax assets will be utilized 
these determinations require estimates of future profits to be forecasted 
actual results may differ from amounts estimated 
fiscal compared to fiscal results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated 
period to period comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and you should not rely on them as an indication of future performance

professional service revenues increased  reflecting a stronger level of utilization throughout fiscal driven  in large measure  by a number of enhancement and upgrade projects to existing customers resulting from the product releases that occurred in the second half fiscal recurring revenues from subscription and maintenance agreements was lower by  reflecting the impact of the run out of a number of maintenance contracts on older license agreements and other cancellations in excess of revenue from new bookings 
revenue from current license sales was higher by  rewards and recognition revenue decreased  on lower redemption volumes in the existing customer base compared to the prior year 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the board of directors approved a plan to take a number of immediate steps to accelerate revenue growth in the on demand software business 
as a result  the company immediately commenced a number of strategic initiatives including increased r d expenditures to launch a targeted middle market product in june of as well as a new product release scheduled for the fall of that further enhances and integrates the critical compensation  performance management and development applications 
additional steps include a significant increase in sales personnel and training  including an expanded sales management team  a broader and deeper field representative group  a telesales organization and additional sales engineering and support resources

enterprise workforce services gross profit was  or of revenues for fiscal compared to  or of revenues for fiscal software margins declined from to year over year primarily as a result of certain redundant costs associated with the migration of various customers from subcontracted hosting partners to a centralized hosting array at the fusepoint datacenter facility in toronto 
this centralization is not only expected to provide cost efficiencies as we scale the on demand business but it also enables us to provide further assurance to our customers regarding performance under service level agreements and other security and privacy requirements 
all new customers are hosted at fusepoint and the final migration process should be completed by october of professional services margins increased from to primarily as a result of much higher utilization rates on the strength of higher billable hour volumes 
additionally  the average rate per hour was slightly ahead of last year 
rewards and recognition margins declined from a year ago to for fiscal  continuing the trend in higher use of gift cards compared to redemption for other products such as electronic and photographic goods that have larger margins 
this shift in product mix is not expected to change in the near term and we anticipate further pressure on rewards margins as a result 
career networks cost of revenues accounted for  of the total cost of revenues for fiscal and  for fiscal  a decrease of  or 
career networks gross profit was  or of revenues for fiscal compared to  or of revenues for fiscal the improved gross profit was directly attributable to the higher revenue per sale in the career transition business and the lower cost of lead generation 
the product set used in career transition services was expanded to allow for additional revenue generating items and the target customer group was shifted to more highly compensated individuals 
both measures  when combined with a higher conversion ratio on leads provided  had a positive impact on gross profit 
additionally  the company was able to augment its lead generation needs by sourcing opportunities from the internet job board business to reduce the overall blended cost of leads 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  an increase of  or

as previously noted  the company is currently increasing its on demand software sales force resources including increased sales and support personnel  a telesales group and a more software industry experienced management team and has simultaneously increased its planned marketing expenditures 
as a result  sales and marketing expenses in this segment are expected to continue to increase for the foreseeable future 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  an increase of  or 
the net increase is primarily due to increases in non cash compensation associated with stock options and professional fees

these fees were offset by lower audit and sarbanes oxley fees 
research and development research and development expenses were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  a decrease of  or 
this decrease reflects a reduction in the use of outside contractors subsequent to the two significant product releases in february and april of during fiscal  the company made a significant investment to update and enhance its acquired technology  standardize and integrate the software applications and build out the talent management suite platform 
the company used outside consultants and offshore development contractors to augment its existing development team and these resources were reduced after the product releases resulting in a significant saving through the first three quarters of fiscal as noted previously  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company moved ahead with its plan to develop various middle market software applications that it expects to be more suitable and cost effective for small and mid size companies 
additionally  a number of other enhancements to its compensation  performance management and development applications are underway for release in the fall of  including further seamless integration between the products and the development of further multi lingual and multicurrency capabilities to allow for international expansion within and outside of our current customer base 
these product development initiatives have required a ramping back up of outside contractors over the next two to three quarters and we anticipate a corresponding higher expense in those periods
