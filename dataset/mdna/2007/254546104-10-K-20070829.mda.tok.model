the increase in net sales from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal was the result of increased sales in all of the major geographic regions in which we do business  as described in greater detail below 
we are subject to the effects of foreign currency fluctuations that have an impact on net sales and gross profits 
currency fluctuations increased net sales by in fiscal and decreased net sales in fiscal growth rates for the last two fiscal years are indicated in the tables below percentage increase in net sales from fiscal from fiscal to to fiscal fiscal total by geographic region north america europe asia pacific 
table of contents percentage change in net sales excluding currency fluctuations from fiscal from fiscal to to fiscal fiscal total by geographic region north america europe asia pacific net sales in north america grew from fiscal to fiscal driven by growth in most markets  including an improvement in the second half of the fiscal year in the life sciences segment and very strong growth in sales of both rfic instrumentation and consumables 
net sales in europe grew in reported dollars net of currency fluctuations from fiscal to fiscal led by growth in the life sciences and environmental markets and strong hplc product sales 
net sales in the asia pacific region grew in reported dollars net of currency fluctuation driven by continued expansion in china  korea  india and australia and growth in the chemical  environmental and food safety markets 
net sales in north america grew in reported dollars from fiscal to fiscal reflecting an improvement in economic conditions throughout the fiscal year 
net sales in europe grew in reported dollars net of currency fluctuations from fiscal to fiscal as a result of a rebound in sales to the life sciences and environmental markets  partially offset by a weaker demand from our larger pharmaceutical and industrial customers in the first half of fiscal net sales in the asia pacific region grew in reported dollars net of currency fluctuation in spite of the continued challenging environment in japan in the first three quarters of fiscal the increases are primarily fueled by strong sales growth in china  korea  australia and india

there was no significant price changes during the three year period ended june  net sales of ic products grew from fiscal to fiscal driven mostly by increases in sales of rfic instrumentation  consumables and services across all major geographies 
net sales of ic products grew from fiscal to fiscal due partially to weaker demand in japan offset by increased sales surrounding the introduction of our ics premiere ic system 
net sales of hplc and nano capillary flow products grew by from fiscal to fiscal driven primarily by increased sales in europe  partially offset by weaker demand in north america in the first half of fiscal sales of hplc and nano capillary flow products grew from fiscal to fiscal primarily as a result of our continued expansion of our global hplc business  offset by the negative impact of a stronger us dollar  some weakness in certain larger pharmaceutical accounts and the product transition from our older summit hplc product line to the new ultimate analytical micro prep flow system 
gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million or 
gross profit as a percentage of sales was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
gross profit as a percentage of sales for fiscal increased primarily due to product mix  currency fluctuations and product cost cutting initiatives related to our newer ics and ultimate product lines 
the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of sales from fiscal to fiscal was mainly due to the effect of a stronger us dollar  product mix  higher manufacturing and ramp up costs related to new product introductions  lower margin as a result of a one time sales promotion for summit systems and compensation cost related to the impact of sfas r 
we anticipate gross margin will be approximately for fiscal year 
table of contents operating expenses fiscal to fiscal from fiscal to fiscal  overall operating expenses increased by to million 
increased expenses in fiscal were primarily attributable to the following factors currency fluctuations continued expansion efforts in the asia pacific region increased depreciation and infrastructure expense increased sales and marketing efforts in europe selling  general and administrative sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal compared with in fiscal sg a expenses were million in fiscal  an increase of from million in fiscal increases in fiscal over include million due to currency fluctuations  million due to our continued expansion into the asia pacific geography  million due to increased expense for depreciation and distributed costs attributable to capital investments and facilities and it infrastructure costs  million due to increased selling and marketing efforts in europe

the increase was offset in part by million in currency fluctuations 
research and product development expenses were of net sales in fiscal compared with in fiscal research and product development expenses in fiscal of million increased by million compared with million in fiscal research and product development expenses have increased due to million of stock based compensation expense  and approximately million due to higher spending to develop our ic and hplc products introduced in fiscal interest income 
interest income in fiscal of million was lower than the million reported for fiscal and higher than the million reported in fiscal the decrease in fiscal from fiscal was due to lower yields on cash reserves held outside of the us  which reserves grew from fiscal to fiscal the increase from fiscal to fiscal was due to higher average cash balances and increasing interest rates in the united states and europe 
interest expense 
interest expense of million remained constant in fiscal  and the interest expense was primarily due to short term borrowings 

table of contents other income  net 
other income in fiscal was million  which was primarily due to the gains on foreign currency exchange 
we had other income in fiscal of million  which was attributable primarily to settlement of a patent litigation partially offset by losses on certain foreign currency contracts 
taxes on income 
our effective tax rate was for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal our effective tax rate is affected by the mix of taxable income among the various tax jurisdictions in which we do business 
the decrease in the effective tax rate from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to special tax charges incurred in fiscal resulting from the resolution of two tax audits 
earnings per share 
diluted earnings per share were  an increase of compared with the reported for fiscal net income for fiscal included costs of approximately  net of tax  or per share  related to the company s initiative to centralize some of its field related technical  administrative and support functions within north america and europe  and a discrete tax benefit from the extension of the federal research credit of approximately  or per share

earnings per share decreased between fiscal and fiscal due to higher costs in connection with our centralization in north america  special tax charges related to two unfavorable tax audits in europe  and due to stock based compensation expense in fiscal liquidity and capital resources 
at june   we had cash and equivalents and short term investments of million 
our working capital was million at june   compared with million at june  cash generated by operating activities was million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in operating cash flows was due to better operating results  increases in deferred revenue  increase in accrued liabilities due to higher accrued payroll costs and higher income taxes payable resulting from lower tax payments  partially offset by higher prepaid expenses 
the decrease in operating cash flows in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to decreases in net income  an increase in accounts receivable due to slower cash collections from customers and exclusion of tax benefits related to stock option exercises that are now reported under cash flows from financing activities as required by sfas r 
the decrease was partially offset by increases in accrued liabilities due to higher deferred revenue and income tax payable due to lower tax payments 
cash used for investing activities was million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decreases from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal were due to lower net proceeds from sale of marketable securities in fiscal and fiscal  partially offset by higher capital expenditures due to expansion of our hplc manufacturing and development facility in germany and the acquisition of the polymer based monolithic technology from teledyne isco  a subsidiary of teledyne technologies  inc our estimate is that capital expenditures will be approximately million in fiscal cash used for financing activities was million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal financing activities for all three years consisted primarily of common stock repurchases  partially offset by proceeds from issuances of shares pursuant to and the tax benefits related to stock option plans in fiscal we repurchased  shares of our common stock for million in fiscal under our repurchase program 
we repurchased  shares for million in fiscal and  shares for million in fiscal we have  remaining shares authorized for repurchase under our repurchase programs at june  at june   our available bank lines of credit totaled million  compared with million at june  we believe our cash flow from operations  our existing cash and cash equivalents and our bank lines of credit will be adequate to meet our cash requirements for at least the next months 
the impact of inflation on our financial position and results of operations was not significant during any of the periods presented

 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose  at specified election dates  to measure eligible items at fair value or fair value option and to report in earnings unrealized gains and losses on those items for which the fair value option has been elected 
sfas also requires entities to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities on the face of the balance sheet 
sfas establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
sfas is effective for us as of the first quarter of fiscal we are currently evaluating the impact of this pronouncement on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the changes to current practice resulting from the application of sfas no 
relate to the definition of fair value  the methods used to measure fair value  and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not believe that the adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
will materially impact our financial position and results of operations

critical accounting policies and estimates summary 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns and allowances  bad debts  inventory valuation  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  warranty and installation provisions  and contingencies  on an on going basis 

table of contents we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition policy 
we derive revenues from the sale of products and the delivery of services to our customers  including installation  training  time and material repairs  and maintenance  which consists of product repair obligations  telephone support  and or unspecified software upgrades 
we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  or service performed  the price is fixed or determinable  collection is probable and vendor specific objective evidence or objective reliable evidence of fair value  as applicable  exists to allocate revenue to the various elements of the arrangement 
in all cases  the portion of revenue allocated to the undelivered elements is deferred until those items are delivered to the customer or the services are performed 
delivery of the product is generally considered to have occurred when shipped 
undelivered elements in our sales arrangements  which are not considered to be essential to the functionality of a product  generally include maintenance  installation services and or training that are delivered after the related products have been delivered 
installation consists of system set up  calibration and basic functionality training and generally requires one to three days depending on the product 
fair value for training services is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately or  if not sold separately  when the price is established by authorized management 
the fair value of installation services is calculated by applying standard service billing rates to the estimate of the number of hours to install a specific product based on historical experience 
these estimated hours for installation have historically been accurate and consistent from product to product 
however  to the extent these estimates were to reflect unfavorable variability  our ability to maintain objective reliable evidence of fair value for such element could be impacted which in turn could delay the recognition of the revenue currently allocated to the delivered elements 
fair value of the maintenance contracts is based on the price charged when an element is sold separately or  if not yet sold separately  when the price is established by authorized management 
maintenance fees are recognized ratably over the period of the related maintenance contracts  which range from one to two years 
maintenance consists of product repair obligations  telephone support  and or unspecified software upgrades 
our sales are typically not subject to rights of return and  historically  actual sales returns have not been significant 
the ability to maintain fair value for undelivered elements and other judgments may affect our reported revenues 
product warranty 
our equipment typically includes a one year warranty 
the estimated cost of product warranty claims is accrued at the time the sale is recognized  based on historical experience 
while we believe our historical experience provides a reliable basis for estimating such warranty cost  unforeseen quality issues or component failure rates could result in future costs in excess of such estimates  or alternatively  improved quality and reliability in our products could result in actual expenses that are below those currently estimated 
loss provisions on accounts receivable and inventory 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of any of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors including  but not limited to  past transaction history with the customer  the credit worthiness of the customer  independent credit reports  industry trends and the macro economic environment 
sales returns and allowances are estimates of future product returns related to current period revenue 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period 
historically  we have not experienced significant sales returns or bad debt losses 
we value our inventory at the lower of standard cost which approximates cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
our estimated valuation provisions on inventory are based on technical obsolescence  historical demand  
table of contents projections of future demand and industry and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional valuation provisions may be required 
if demand or market conditions are more favorable than projected  higher margins could be realized to the extent inventory is sold which had previously been written down 
long lived assets  intangible assets with finite lives and goodwill 
we assess for the impairment of long lived assets  intangible assets with finite lives and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in addition  we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant changes or developments in strategic technology 
when we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets and intangible assets with finite lives may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above or other indicators  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair values of related reporting units to their carrying values 
we are required to perform an impairment review for goodwill at least annually 
taxes on income 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation  amortization and inventory reserves  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent management believes that recovery is more likely than not  a valuation allowance must be established 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  we may need to revise the valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
stock based compensation 
sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r requires that all share based payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair value 
we have used the black scholes model to determine the fair value of our stock option awards 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting periods 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date required judgment  including estimating stock price volatility and employee stock options exercise behaviors 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense recognized in our results of operations could be materially affected 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest  the amount of the expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas no 
r  the compensation expense that we record in the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and stock prices of marketable securities 
with the exception of the stock price volatility of our marketable equity securities  we manage our exposure to these and other risks through our regular operating and financing activities and  when appropriate  through our hedging activities 
our policy is not to use hedges or other derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
we deal with a diversified group of major financial institutions to limit the risk of nonperformance by any one institution on any financial instrument 
separate from our financial hedging 
table of contents activities  material changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and  to a lesser extent  commodity prices could cause significant changes in the costs to manufacture and deliver our products and in customers buying practices 
we have not substantially changed our risk management practices during fiscal and we do not currently anticipate significant changes in financial market risk exposures in the near future that would require us to change our current risk management practices 
foreign currency exchange 
revenues generated from international operations are generally denominated in foreign currencies 
we entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge against fluctuations of intercompany account balances 
market value gains and losses on these hedge contracts are substantially offset by fluctuations in the underlying balances being hedged  and the net financial impact is not expected to be material in future periods 
at june   we had forward exchange contracts to sell foreign currencies totaling million  including approximately million in euros  million in japanese yen  million in australian dollars and million in canadian dollars 
at june   we had forward exchange contracts to sell foreign currencies totaling million  including approximately million in euros  million in japanese yen   in australian dollars and  in canadian dollars 
the foreign exchange contracts at the end of each fiscal year mature within the first quarter of the following fiscal year 
additionally  contract values and fair market values are the same 
in march  we entered into a cross currency swap of japanese yen for million which matures in march this derivate instrument did not qualify for net investment hedge accounting and was deemed to be an ineffective hedge instrument  given that  at the inception of the hedge transaction  there was no formal documentation of the hedging relationship and our risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge 
therefore  we marked to market the increase in value of approximately  and this amount was recorded in other income  net 
a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to our hedging contracts and underlying balances being hedged at june  and indicated that these market movements would not have a material effect on the our business  operating results or financial condition 
foreign currency rate fluctuations can impact the us dollar translation of our foreign operations in our consolidated financial statements 
currency fluctuations increased sales by in fiscal and decreased sales by in fiscal currency fluctuations increased sales by in fiscal interest and investment income 
our interest and investment income is subject to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash equivalents and short term investments 
a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical movement in interest rates applied to our investment balances at june  and indicated that such market movement would not have a material effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
actual gains or losses in the future may differ materially from this analysis  depending on our actual balances and changes in the timing and amount of interest rate movements 
debt and interest expense 
at june   we had notes payable of  a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical movement in interest rates applied to our outstanding debt balance at june   indicated that such market movement would not have a material effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
actual gains or losses in the future may differ materially from this analysis  depending on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate movements and the level of borrowings maintained by us
