table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated net sales increased by million  or to  million in  from  million in the increase in net sales was attributable to the acquisition of amico in october  which provided an additional million in net sales in  and the acquisition of emc in november  which provided million in net sales in the decrease in net sales excluding the effect of these acquisitions was the result of sales declines in our historic building products business  the result of volume decreases due to softening in the domestic automotive and new build housing markets  along with the reduction in severe weather during as compared to  which drove volumes during at certain subsidiaries 
cost of sales increased million  or  to  million in from million in the increase was due to higher sales volumes due to acquisitions noted above 
the acquisitions of amico in october and emc in november added million to cost of sales in the million decrease in cost of sales for the remainder of the business was the result of product mix and lower material costs as a percentage of sales 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to in  from in the increase in gross margin is attributable mainly to lower material costs in the building products segment which more than offset higher material costs in the processed metals segment in compared to selling  general and administrative expenses increased approximately million  or  to million in  from million in the acquisition of amico in october and emc in november caused million of the increase in selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales increased  to in from in  due mainly to higher legal costs associated with acquisition activities  higher compensation costs and higher health insurance costs 
as a result of the above  income from operations increased by approximately million  to million in from million in interest expense increased or million  to million in from million in the increase in interest was the result of higher average borrowings in and higher weighed average interest rates 
equity in income loss of partnerships and other income decreased by million in this decline was due mainly to the impairment of our investment in gibraltar dfc strip steel  llc  a joint venture 
during december  the company determined that its investment in this joint venture was other than temporarily impaired  and recognized a million charge related to the joint venture

table of contents processed metal products 
net sales increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase in net sales was primarily the result of increased copper costs which resulted in higher selling prices 
income from operations declined million  or  to million in from million in income from operations as a percentage of net sales declined to in from in the decrease was the result of higher material costs partially offset by lower profit sharing expenses 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated net sales increased by approximately million  or  to  million in  from in the increase in sales was attributable to the acquisition of amico in october  which provided million  the acquisitions of the gutter helmet product line september  american wilcon october  and scm asia september provided an additional million in sales  and a full year s results from scm metal products inc scm acquired in june  which resulted in an additional million 
the remaining increase was the result of increases in both volume and selling prices 
the volume increases were driven by our strategy of using our national manufacturing  marketing and distribution capabilities to sell products from a greater number of our product lines to both new and existing customers  especially national customers  and from offering product extensions and design enhancements to existing product lines  particularly in the building products segment 
cost of sales increased by approximately million  or  to million in  from million in the increase was due mainly to the higher sales volumes resulting from acquisitions and expanded penetration noted above  along with the higher cost of steel and other materials used in our products 
the acquisitions of amico  the gutter helmet product line  american wilcon and scm asia  along with the acquisition of scm contributed million of the increase in cost of sales 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to in  from in the decrease in gross margins is attributable to higher raw material costs  and to a lesser extent  increased energy costs 
in particular  we had purchased extra steel in early to build up our inventory because we were concerned that rising steel prices at that time could lead to steel shortages 
these shortages did not materialize  and  when steel prices began to decline in mid  our margins were compressed as we sold relatively high cost inventory at the lower prices demanded by the market in the processed metal products segment and at prices in the building products segment that did not fully pass on the costs of inventory 
the decline in gross margins in was partially offset by better cost absorption due to higher volumes  as compared to the same period in the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased approximately million  or  to million in  from million in the primary reason for the increase was due to the acquisition of amico in october and a full year of expense at scm which contributed million of the increase 
excluding the effect of the acquisitions  selling  general and administrative costs were relatively flat as increases in salaries were more than offset by the decline in bonuses 
as a result  selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales decreased to in  from in as a result of the above  income from operations increased to approximately million in  from million in interest expense increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase was the result of prepayment penalties of million incurred in connection with the repayment of certain senior secured and private placement notes  with the remaining increase the result of higher average borrowings during  and higher weighted average interest rates 
equity in income of partnerships and other income decreased million to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to our share of the losses incurred during from our equity interest in 
table of contents gibraltar dfc strip steel llc  a joint venture 
the losses were incurred as the joint venture lost significant volume to a competitor that reduced selling prices and relatively high inventory costs at the joint venture 
income taxes related to continuing operations for approximated million based upon an effective tax rate of versus a effective tax rate in the qualified production activities deduction under the american jobs creation act of did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate 
income from discontinued operations for was million compared to million in segment information building products 
net sales increased by approximately million  or  to million in  from million in the increase in net sales was due primarily to the acquisition of amico in october  which accounted for million in sales 
the remaining increase in net sales was the result of expanded sales penetration due to the factors described under consolidated above and price increases 
income from operations increased million  or  to million in from million in operating margin increased to in from in the increase was driven by the acquisition of amico  which has slightly higher margins than the pre existing building products businesses  and a reduction in selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales  mainly a function of increased sales 
processed metal products 
net sales increased by approximately million  or  to million in  from million in the increase in net sales was primarily a function of higher average selling prices in driven by the rise in steel prices that occurred throughout  as well as the acquisition of scm in june  which accounted for million of the increase 
although steel prices declined in  our selling prices were still higher on average than our selling prices in income from operations as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in the decrease in operating margin was primarily the result of increased material costs partially offset by lower labor costs as percentage of net sales and a full year of operations of scm which has slightly higher operating margins than the remainder of our processed metals products business 
the reduction in margins was most notable in our service center business 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make decisions based upon estimates  assumptions  and factors it considers relevant to the circumstances 
such decisions include the selection of applicable principles and the use of judgment in their application  the results of which could differ from those anticipated 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies are described in note of the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
our most critical accounting policies include valuation of accounts receivable  which impacts selling  general and administrative expense  valuation of inventory  which impacts cost of sales and gross margin  revenue recognition  which impacts net sales  gross margin and net income  the allocation of the purchase price of our acquisition related assets and liabilities  which affects our depreciation and amortization costs  and 
table of contents the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and other intangible and long lived assets  which impacts write offs of goodwill  intangibles and long lived assets 
management reviews the estimates  including the allowance for doubtful accounts and inventory reserves on a regular basis and makes adjustments based on historical experience  current conditions and future expectations 
management believes these estimates are reasonable  but actual results could differ from these estimates 
valuation of accounts receivable 
our accounts receivable represent those amounts that have been billed to our customers but not yet collected 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the portion of those accounts receivable that we believe are potentially uncollectible based on various factors  including historical experience  creditworthiness of customers and current market and economic conditions 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
changes in judgments on these factors could impact the timing of costs recognized 
valuation of inventories 
we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we determine the cost basis of our inventory on a first in first out basis using either actual costs or a standard cost methodology that approximates actual cost 
we regularly review inventory on hand and record provisions for obsolete and slow moving inventory based on historical and current sales trends 
changes in product demand and our customer base may affect the value of inventory on hand  which may require higher provisions for obsolete inventory 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when all of the following have occurred products are shipped or service is provided  the customer takes ownership and assumes the risk of loss  collection of the relevant receivable is probable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
we treat sales returns  allowances and customer incentives as reductions to sales  and we accrue for those items based on historical experience and current estimates of future sales  revising our estimates throughout the year when necessary 
allocation to purchase price of acquired assets and liabilities 
when we acquire a new business  we must allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in the transaction at their respective estimated fair market values 
we record any premium over the fair market value of the net assets acquired as goodwill 
the allocation of the purchase price involves judgments and estimates both in characterizing the assets and in determining their fair market value 
the way we characterize the assets has important implications  as long lived assets  for example  are depreciated or amortized  whereas goodwill is tested annually for impairment  as explained below 
with respect to determining the fair market value of assets  the most difficult estimations of individual fair market values are those involving long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment and identified intangible assets 
we use all available information to make these fair market value determinations and  for major business acquisitions  engage an independent valuation specialist to assist in the fair market value determination of the acquired long lived assets 
due to the subjectivity inherent in determining the estimated fair market value of long lived assets and the significant number of business acquisitions that we have completed  we believe that the recording of acquired assets and liabilities is a critical accounting policy 
depreciation  amortization and impairment testing of long lived assets 
we depreciate long lived assets with estimated useful lives over those useful lives 
we amortize intangible assets with estimable useful lives which consist primarily of acquired customer lists  non competition agreements and unpatented technology over those estimated useful lives 
the specific lives are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item herein 
we test long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable and exceeds their fair market value 
this circumstance exists if the carrying amount of the asset in question exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
the impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair market value as determined by discounted cash flow method or in the case of negative cash flow  an independent market appraisal of the asset 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset impairment testing 
we test goodwill annually for impairment or more often if indicators of impairment exist at the reporting unit level by comparing the fair market value of the reporting unit with its carrying value 
a reporting unit is either the same as  or one level below  an operating segment 
we have 
table of contents more reporting units than operating segments  and our reporting units may change over time 
the primary valuation method for determining the fair market value of the reporting unit is a discounted cash flow analysis 
if the goodwill is indicated as being impaired ie  the fair market value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount  the fair market value of the reporting unit is then allocated to its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
this implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill  and  if it is less  we then recognize an impairment loss 
the company tests its indefinite lived assets from impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter  or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset could be below its carrying amount 
the impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset  determined using discounted cash flows  with its carrying amount 
an impairment loss would be recognized for the carrying amount in excess of its fair value 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal capital requirements are to fund its operations  including working capital  to purchase new facilities and fund improvements to its existing facilities  to purchase new and maintain existing machinery and equipment  and to fund acquisitions 
we regularly consider various strategic business opportunities including acquisitions 
we evaluate such potential acquisitions on the basis of our ability to enhance our existing products  operations  or capabilities  as well as provide access to new products  markets and customers 
if we enter into any future acquisition transaction  we may finance that acquisition through a number of sources  including internally available cash resources  new debt financing  the issuance of equity securities or any combination of the above 
working capital during  our company s working capital inclusive of the impact of working capital acquired from acquisitions of emc  home impressions and steel city increased by approximately million  or  to approximately million at december  from million at december  this increase in working capital was primarily the result of an increase in inventories of million  a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million  a decrease of million in other liabilities and increases in accounts receivable of million  partially offset by a million decrease in assets from discontinued operations and a million reduction in cash and cash equivalents 
our working capital also typically undergoes seasonal variations 
our net sales are generally lower in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter  and we usually begin the fourth quarter with lower inventory and higher accounts payable 
to address these fluctuations  we generally increase working capital in the second and third quarters  and working capital then generally decreases in the fourth quarter 
at december   our working capital was higher than normal due to a reduction in sales during the fourth quarter that reduced the rate of liquidation of our inventories that we would normally expect 
cash flows operating activities 
net cash used in continuing operations for the year ended december  was approximately million compared to net cash provided by continuing operations of approximately million for the year ended december  net cash used in continuing operations for the year ended december  was primarily the result of increases in inventories of million  decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million  and decreases of deferred taxes of million  partially offset by net income from continuing operations of million  depreciation and amortization of million  and equity in partnerships loss of million

financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million  consisting primarily of repayments of long term debt under our senior term facility of million and dividend payments of million  partially offset by proceeds of million under our revolving credit facility 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million  consisting primarily of borrowings of long term debt under our senior term facility of million and the proceeds of million from the issuance of senior subordinated notes  partially offset by payments of million under our revolving credit facility  in senior secured and private placement notes  the repayment of million in acquisition notes  the payment of million in deferred financing costs and dividend payments of million

at december   outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility were million  million of letters of credit were outstanding and million was available to be borrowed 
during  we repaid million of the term loan and at december   we had million outstanding on the term loan

 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
the statement focuses 
table of contents primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas no 
r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
this statement was effective as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period that began after june  and the company adopted the standard in the first quarter of implementation of this statement caused expense of approximately  as the company recognized expense related to unvested stock options 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  sfas which clarifies the types of costs that should be expensed rather than capitalized as inventory 
this statement also clarifies the circumstances under which fixed overhead costs associated with operating facilities involved in inventory processing should be capitalized 
the provisions of sfas no 
were effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and the company adopted this standard in the first quarter of implementation of this statement did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin or the interpretation which defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authority 
uncertainty in income taxes  as used in the title of the new interpretation  refers to uncertainty about how some transactions will be treated under the tax law 
this uncertainty leads to questions about whether tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns should be reflected in the financial statements before they are finally resolved with the taxing authorities 
fin applies to all tax positions  regardless of their level of uncertainty or the nature of the position 
however  the interpretation s recognition and measurement requirements are likely to have the most impact on positions for which current or future deductions may be disallowed or reduced in a tax examination 
the interpretation applies to situations where the uncertainty is about the timing of the deduction  the amount of the deduction  or the validity of the deduction 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and we will adopt this interpretation during the first quarter of we do not expect that this interpretation will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
fair value measurements sfas  which establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value  sets out a framework for measuring fair value  and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas applies only to fair value measurements that are already required or permitted by other accounting standards and is expected to increase the consistency of those measurements 
sfas is effective for fair value measures already required or permitted by other standards for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we have not yet evaluated the effect that this standard may have upon our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas  which requires employers to recognize on their balance sheets the funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
sfas no 
also requires companies to recognize actuarial gains and losses  prior service cost  and any remaining transition amounts from the initial application of statements and when recognizing a plan s funded status  with the offset to accumulated other comprehensive income 
the provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years ending after december  and we have adopted this standard effective december  adoption of this standard resulted in a million increase in other non current liabilities  a million decrease in other comprehensive income  and a 
million increase in deferred tax assets 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no
