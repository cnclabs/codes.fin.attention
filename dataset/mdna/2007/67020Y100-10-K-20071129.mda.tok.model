table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal cost of product and licensing revenue for fiscal increased million as compared to fiscal primarily due to costs relating to our acquisitions 
as a percentage of product and licensing revenue  cost of product and licensing revenue increased slightly in fiscal  largely due to our acquisitions products that have higher cost of goods sold relative to our other products 
the added costs of goods sold for the acquired products are primarily due to third party hardware that is included in the solutions licensed to customers

cost of professional services  subscription and hosting revenue in our organic business increased million  or as compared to the base  on organic revenue growth 
this significant improvement for the organic business was largely as a result of our ability to increase the utilization of existing resources in our healthcare and network professional service teams which drove an increase of percentage points in gross margin for the professional services  subscription and hosting revenue 
fiscal compared to fiscal cost of professional services  subscription and hosting revenue increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to million of costs due to our acquisitions  which have professional services organizations to support their revenue including the dictaphone subscription based licensing and hosted application customer base 
the growth in costs supports the growth in related revenue for fiscal cost of professional services as a percentage of the revenue  excluding share based payments which changed million  improved as synergies were realized from the merging of the service teams from our acquisitions 
these improvements were offset partially by increased expenses for the subscription and hosting services

this decrease in percentage is primarily attributable to lower costs relative to the revenue in our speech business  including our healthcare maintenance and support business following our acquisition of dictaphone and also in areas other than speech due to synergies we realized upon the combination of pre existing and acquired product lines following our acquisition of former nuance 
cost of revenue from amortization of intangible assets cost of revenue from amortization of intangible assets consists of the amortization of acquired patents and core and completed technology using the straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically or whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable 
the following table shows cost of revenue from amortization of intangible assets  in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue in millions change change fiscal fiscal fiscal vs vs cost of revenue from amortization of intangible assets as a percentage of total revenue fiscal compared to fiscal cost of revenue from amortization of intangible assets increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to million in amortization of intangible assets related to our acquisitions offset by a fiscal non recurring charge of million to write down technology licensed from a third party to its net realizable value 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of revenue from amortization of intangible assets declined from to largely because of a non recurring charge in fiscal as well as the effect of amortization expense over a larger revenue base 

table of contents based on the amortizable intangible assets as of september   and assuming no impairment or reduction in expected lives  we expect cost of revenue from amortization of intangible assets for fiscal to be million 
fiscal compared to fiscal cost of revenue from amortization of intangible assets increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to the million in amortization of intangible assets relating to our acquisitions and million incremental expense resulting from amortization of the december settlement and license from z technologies  inc in addition  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that we would not make additional investments to support a technology licensed from a non related third party in as a result  we revised the cash flow estimates related to the purchased technology and recorded an additional million in cost of revenue to write down the purchased technology to its net realizable value 
these increases were offset in part by the cessation of the amortization of technology and patents that was established in connection with our acquisitions consummated in and as they were fully amortized 
research and development expense research and development expense primarily consists of salaries and benefits and overhead relating to our engineering staff 
the following table shows research and development expense  in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue dollars in millions change change fiscal fiscal fiscal vs vs research and development expense as a percentage of total revenue fiscal compared to fiscal research and development expense increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal due to an increase of million in compensation expense due to increased headcount largely associated with our acquisitions  an additional million for contract labor and professional services to support ongoing research and development projects and an additional million of increased shared based payment expense 
to date  we have not capitalized any internal development costs as the cost incurred after technological feasibility but before release of products has not been significant 
the remaining increase relates to additional employee related travel  entertainment and infrastructure expenses 
while increasing in absolute dollars  research and development expense continued to decrease as a proportion of total revenue reflecting achievement of synergies following acquisitions and on going efforts to increase productivity 
we believe that the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products are essential to our success 
accordingly  we plan to continue to invest in research and development activities at approximately the same percentage of revenue in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal research and development expense increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal due to a million increase in compensation related expense due to increased headcount largely resulting from our acquisitions and an increase of million relating to share based payments 
the remaining increase was attributable to an increase in other headcount related expenses  including travel and infrastructure related expenses as we continued to invest in our products 
while continuing to increase in absolute dollars  research and development expense has decreased relative to our total revenue 
this decrease in expense as a percentage of total revenue reflects synergies following previous acquisitions 

table of contents sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense includes salaries and benefits  commissions  advertising  direct mail  public relations  tradeshows and other costs of marketing programs  travel expenses associated with our sales organization and overhead 
the following table shows sales and marketing expense  in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue dollars in millions change change fiscal fiscal fiscal vs vs sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenue fiscal compared to fiscal sales and marketing expense increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to an increase of million in salaries and other variable costs  such as commissions and travel expenses relating to increased headcount from our acquisitions and to support the organic business  an increase of million relating to share based compensation  and an increase of million relating to marketing programs and channel program expenses 
the remaining increase in expenses relates to employee related travel  temporary and professional services  recruiting and other expenses associated with the support of the sales and marketing organization 
while the expenses increased in absolute dollars  sales and marketing expenses continued to decrease as a percentage of total revenue due to synergies achieved from acquisitions and increased productivity of sales organization 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to pursue our strategic goals but remain relatively consistent as a percentage of revenue in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal sales and marketing expense increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to a million increase in our acquisitions and continued investment in the sales force for our existing products  an increase of million relating to share based payments and a million increase in marketing expenses primarily to support new product releases made during fiscal as well as marketing expenses associated with products acquired as part of our acquisitions 
while the expense in absolute dollars increased  sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue decreased as we achieved higher sales volumes while controlling our cost structure 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense primarily consists of personnel costs  including overhead  for administration  finance  human resources  information systems  facilities and general management  fees for external professional advisors including accountants and attorneys  insurance  and provisions for doubtful accounts 
the following table shows general and administrative expense  in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue dollars in millions change change fiscal fiscal fiscal vs vs general and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenue 
table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal general and administrative expense increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to increased compensation associated with our acquisitions  an increase of million relating to share based compensation  and a million increase in expenses relating to temporary employees and professional services to support our growing organization 
while expenses increased in absolute dollars  the expenses have decreased as a percent of total revenue primarily as we have realized synergies from the integration of general and administrative organizations of acquired companies into our general and administrative organization 
we expect general and administrative expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars but decrease slightly as a percentage of revenue as we continue to achieve synergies of scale 
fiscal compared to fiscal general and administrative expense increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal our acquisitions contributed million of this increase  including million paid to dictaphone staff for non recurring activities necessary to transition knowledge and processes post acquisition 
general and administrative expense  excluding those related to our acquisitions  increased million due primarily to compensation for increased employees and external contractors in the finance  human resources  legal and other general and administrative functions 
this increase in spending on staff and contractors was related to our need to comply with new regulations  such as the implementation of sfas r in fiscal these new initiatives were partially offset by a reduction in overall costs for staffing and contractors needed to comply with the provisions of sarbanes oxley in fiscal while the expense increased in absolute dollars  general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue decreased as we achieved higher sales volumes while controlling our cost structure 
amortization of other intangible assets amortization of other intangible assets into operating expense includes amortization of acquired customer and contractual relationships  non competition agreements and acquired trade names and trademarks 
customer relationships are amortized on an accelerated basis based upon the pattern in which the economic benefit of customer relationships are being utilized 
other identifiable intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
we evaluate these assets for impairment and for appropriateness of their remaining life on an ongoing basis 
the following table shows amortization of other intangible assets  in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue dollars in millions change change fiscal fiscal fiscal vs vs amortization of other intangible assets as a percentage of total revenue fiscal compared to fiscal amortization of intangible assets increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to million in amortization of intangible assets related to our acquisitions 
customer relationships compose the majority of the intangible assets amortized to operating expense  and are amortized to expense based upon patterns in which the economic benefits are expected to be utilized 
based on these patterns  the amortization relating to certain of our acquisitions consummated in fiscal acquisitions and before  was less in fiscal than in fiscal this decrease partially offset the increase from our acquisitions 
based on the amortizable intangible assets as of september   and assuming no impairment or reduction in expected lives  we expect cost of revenue from amortization of intangible assets for fiscal to be million 

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal amortization of intangible assets increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal largely attributable to the million of amortization of identifiable intangible assets related to our acquisitions and full year amortization relating to our fiscal acquisitions 
restructuring and other charges credits  net during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million reduction to existing restructuring reserves as a result of the execution of a favorable sublease agreement relating to one of the facilities included in our restructuring plan 
the amount was partially offset by other net adjustments of million associated with prior years restructuring programs 
in fiscal  we incurred restructuring charges of million 
the charges were related to the elimination of ten employees during the first quarter of  a plan of restructuring relative to certain of our facilities in june  and a september plan of restructuring to eliminate additional facilities and a reduction of approximately employees in connection with our acquisition of former nuance 
the facilities charges included million related to the write down of leasehold improvements based on their net book value relative to the fair market value for their shortened lives 
the reduction in personnel was primarily from the research and development and sales and marketing teams  and was based on the elimination of redundancies resulting from our acquisition of former nuance 
the following table sets forth the activity relating to the restructuring accruals in fiscal  and in millions personnel facilities asset related costs impairment total balance at september  restructuring and other charges non cash write off cash payments balance at september  restructuring and other charges credits cash payments balance at september  restructuring and other charges credits cash payments balance at september  other income expense  net the following table shows other income expense  net in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue dollars in millions change change fiscal fiscal fiscal vs vs interest income interest expense other income expense  net total other income expense  net as a percentage of total revenue 
table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal interest income increased million in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to higher cash and investment balances during fiscal as well as higher interest rates 
interest expense increased million during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to i interest related to the credit facility we entered into on march  having been outstanding for a full months  ii the april and august amendments to that facility that added million and million of debt  respectively  and iii the million convertible debentures that we issued in august additionally  we have recorded million of non cash interest expense mainly related to imputed interest in association with certain lease obligations included in our accrued business combination costs and accrued restructuring charges  the amortization of debt issuance costs associated with the credit facility we entered into on march  as well as to the accretion of the interest related to the note payable from our phonetic acquisition in february other income expense principally consisted of foreign exchange gains losses as a result of the changes in foreign exchange rates on certain of our foreign subsidiaries who have transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies  as well as the translation of certain of our intercompany balances 
we expect interest expense to increase during fiscal  relative to fiscal  as we pay interest on the credit facility  as amended  as well as on the new convertible debentures  and as we amortize the debt issuance costs and debt discount for the full year as compared to the partial year during which these items were outstanding in fiscal we will continue to record interest expense as it relates to certain lease obligations included in our accrued restructuring and accrued business combination costs 
fiscal compared to fiscal interest income increased million in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to higher cash and investment balances during fiscal  as compared to the prior year  and to a lesser degree to greater yields on our cash and investments 
interest expense increased million during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  mainly due to million of interest expense paid quarterly on the credit facility we entered into on march  other income expense principally consisted of foreign exchange gains losses as a result of the changes in foreign exchange rates on certain of our foreign subsidiaries whose operations are denominated in other than their local currencies  as well as the translation of certain of our intercompany balances 
provision for income taxes the following table shows the provision for income taxes  in absolute dollars and the effective income tax rate in thousands  except percentages change change fiscal fiscal fiscal vs vs income tax provision benefit effective income tax rate fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal the variance from the federal statutory rate in all periods was due primarily to the increase in our valuation allowance with respect to certain deferred tax assets 
valuation allowances have been established for the us net deferred tax asset  which we believe do not meet the more likely than not realization criteria established by sfas  accounting for income taxes 
due to a history of cumulative losses in the united states  a full valuation allowance has been recorded against the net deferred assets of our us entities 
at september   we had a valuation allowance for us net deferred tax assets of approximately million 
the us net deferred tax assets is composed of tax assets primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards resulting both from business combinations and from operations and tax credits  offset by deferred tax liabilities primarily related to intangible assets 
certain of these intangible assets have indefinite lives  and the resulting deferred tax liability 
table of contents associated with these assets is not allowed as an offset to our deferred tax assets for purposes of determining the required amount of our valuation allowance 
our utilization of deferred tax assets that were acquired in a business combination primarily net operating loss carryforwards will require the reversal of the deferred tax asset in accordance with the manner in which the deferred tax asset was originally recorded and will vary based upon the business combination whose deferred tax assets are being utilized 
our establishment of new deferred tax assets as a result of operating activities requires the establishment of valuation allowances based upon the sfas more likely than not realization criteria 
the establishment of a valuation allowance relating to operating activities is recorded as an increase to tax expense 
our tax provision also includes state and foreign tax expense  which is determined on either a legal entity or separate tax jurisdiction basis 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents totaled million as of september   an increase of million compared to million as of september  in addition  we had million of marketable securities as of september  we completed fiscal with working capital of million as compared to million at the end of fiscal as of september   total retained deficit was million 
we do not expect our retained deficit to impact our future ability to operate given our strong cash and financial position 
our increase in cash and cash equivalents was composed of million provided by operating activities  partially offset by the net impact of cash provided by financing activities and cash used in investing activities 
cash provided by operating activities cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was million  an increase of million  or  from million provided by operating activities in fiscal the increase was primarily composed of changes relating to the net loss after adding back non cash items such as depreciation and amortization and share based compensation 
in fiscal this amount was million compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
this increase in fiscal was augmented by changes in working capital accounts of million  which was composed primarily of a million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses  offset by a million increase in accounts receivable 
the increase in accounts receivable represents a increase as compared to the september  balance of million  while the accounts payable and accrued expenses represent a increase to the september  balance of million 
each of the accounts receivable and the accounts payable and accrued expenses grew in support of our business which grew considerably in fiscal  with revenue increasing as compared to fiscal cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was million  an increase of million  or  from million provided by operating activities in fiscal the increase was primarily composed of changes relating to the net loss after adding back non cash items such as depreciation and amortization and share based compensation 
in fiscal this amount was million compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
this increase in the comparable annual periods was offset by net changes to working capital accounts of million 
beginning in fiscal  sfas r requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of the tax affected compensation that would have been recognized as if we had always accounted for our share based compensation activity under sfas r to be reported as a cash flow from financing activities  rather than as a cash flow from operating activities  as was prescribed under accounting rules applicable through fiscal under sfas r  these excess tax benefits from share based compensation activity generated in and  are reported as a cash flow from financing activities with an offsetting cash flow used in operating activities 
the benefits of tax deductions in excess of the tax affected compensation could fluctuate significantly from period to period based on the number of share based compensation exercised  sold or vested  the tax benefit realized and the tax affected compensation recognized 

table of contents cash used in investing activities cash used in investing activities for fiscal was million  an increase of million  or  as compared to million for fiscal the increase in cash used in investing was primarily driven by a million increase in cash paid relating to our acquisitions

critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  nuance evaluates its estimates  assumptions and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts and returns  accounting for patent legal defense costs  the costs to complete the development of custom software applications  the valuation of goodwill  other intangible assets and tangible long lived assets  accounting for acquisitions  share based payments  obligation relating to pension and post retirement benefit plans  interest rate swaps which are characterized as derivative instruments  income tax reserves and valuation allowances  and loss contingencies 
nuance management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
nuance believes the following critical accounting policies most significantly affect the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations and require its most difficult and subjective judgments 
revenue recognition 
nuance recognizes product and licensing revenue in accordance with statement of position  or sop   software revenue recognition  and sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  and related authoritative literature 
the application of sop requires judgment  including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value exists for those elements 
nuance s software arrangements generally include software and post contract support which includes telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades enhancements on a when and if available basis  typically for one to three years 
changes to the elements in a software arrangement  the ability to identify vsoe for those elements and the fair value of the respective elements could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue 
judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products 
in accordance with sop  revenue is recognized when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the fee is fixed or determinable and iv collectibility is probable 
non software revenue is recognized in accordance with  the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin  or sab   revenue recognition in financial statements 
under sab  nuance recognizes revenue when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the fees are fixed or determinable and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
professional services revenue is recognized in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain performance type contracts on the percentage of completion method 
nuance generally determines the percentage of completion by comparing the labor hours incurred to date to the estimated 
table of contents total labor hours required to complete the project 
nuance considers labor hours to be the most reliable  available measure of progress on these projects 
adjustments to estimates to complete are made in the periods in which facts resulting in a change become known 
when the estimate indicates that a loss will be incurred  such loss is recorded in the period identified 
significant judgments and estimates are involved in determining the percent complete of each contract 
different assumptions could yield materially different results 
nuance makes estimate of sales returns based on historical experience 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  revenue recognition when right of return exists  the provision for these estimated returns is recorded as a reduction of revenue and accounts receivable at the time that the related revenue is recorded 
nuance also makes estimates and reduces revenue recognized for price protection and rebates  and certain marketing allowances at the time the related revenue is recorded 
if actual results differ significantly from nuance s estimates  such differences could have a material impact on nuance s results of operations for the period in which the actual results become known 
nuance s revenue recognition policies require management to make significant estimates 
management analyzes various factors  including a review of specific transactions  historical experience  creditworthiness of customers and current market and economic conditions 
changes in judgments based upon these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue and cost recognized and thus affects nuance s results of operations and financial condition 
capitalized patent defense costs 
nuance monitors the anticipated outcome of legal actions  and if nuance determines that the success of the defense of a patent is probable  and so long as nuance believes that the future economic benefit of the patent will be increased  nuance then capitalizes external legal costs incurred in the defense of these patents  up to the level of the expected increased future economic benefit 
if changes in the anticipated outcome occur  nuance writes off any capitalized costs in the period the change is determined 
as of september  and  capitalized patent defense costs totaled million 
additional costs had been capitalized in fiscal relating to our historic litigation with voicesignal  upon the consummation of our acquisition of voicesignal we reclassified million of previously capitalized patent defense costs  of which the majority were recorded into goodwill as a component of the purchase price of voicesignal 
research and development costs 
nuance accounts for the internal costs relating to research and development activities in accordance with sfas  accounting for research and development costs  and sfas  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
research and development costs incurred for new software products and enhancements to existing products  other than certain software development costs that qualify for capitalization  are expensed as incurred 
software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility  but prior to the general release of the product  are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated useful life of the related products 
judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established 
nuance has determined that technological feasibility for its software products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing 
costs incurred after technological feasibility is established have not been material  and accordingly  nuance has expensed the internal costs relating to research and development when incurred 
licensed technology 
the cost of technology which we have licensed to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed by us is capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated useful life of the related products 
at each balance sheet date  nuance evaluates these assets for impairment by comparing the unamortized cost to the net realizable value 
amortization expense was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
included in the fiscal amortization expense was an additional million of expense representing an impairment determined to exist in order to value the licensed technology at its net realizable value 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the net unamortized licensed technology included in other intangible assets at september  and were million and million  respectively 
valuation of long lived tangible and intangible assets and goodwill 
nuance has significant long lived tangible and intangible assets  including goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  which are susceptible to valuation adjustments as a result of changes in various factors or conditions 
the most significant long lived tangible and intangible assets are fixed assets  patents and core technology  completed technology  customer relationships and trademarks 
all finite lived intangible assets are amortized based upon patterns in which the 
table of contents economic benefits of customer relationships are expected to be utilized 
the values of intangible assets  with the exception of goodwill  were initially determined by a risk adjusted  discounted cash flow approach 
nuance assesses the potential impairment of identifiable intangible assets and fixed assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable and at least annually 
factors nuance considers important  which could trigger an impairment of such assets  include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of or use of the acquired assets or the strategy for nuance s overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in nuance s stock price for a sustained period  and a decline in nuance s market capitalization below net book value 
future adverse changes in these or other unforeseeable factors could result in an impairment charge that would materially impact future results of operations and financial position in the reporting period identified 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  nuance tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis as of july  and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist 
the impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  to assess whether impairment is present 
nuance has reviewed the provisions of sfas with respect to the criteria necessary to evaluate the number of reporting units that exist 
based on its review  nuance has determined that it operates in one reporting unit 
based on this assessment  nuance has not had any impairment charges during its history as a result of its impairment evaluation of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets under sfas in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  nuance periodically reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of those assets are no longer appropriate 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flows to the recorded carrying value for the asset 
if impairment is indicated  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
no impairment charges were taken in fiscal  or  based on the review of long lived assets under sfas significant judgments and estimates are involved in determining the useful lives of nuance s long lived assets  determining what reporting units exist and assessing when events or circumstances would require an interim impairment analysis of goodwill or other long lived assets to be performed 
changes in nuance s organization or its management reporting structure  as well as other events and circumstances  including but not limited to technological advances  increased competition and changing economic or market conditions  could result in a shorter estimated useful lives  b additional reporting units  which may require alternative methods of estimating fair values or greater disaggregation or aggregation in nuance s analysis by reporting unit  and or c other changes in previous assumptions or estimates 
in turn  this could have a significant impact on nuance s consolidated financial statements through accelerated amortization and or impairment charges 
accounting for acquisitions 
we have completed a number of significant business and other asset acquisitions over the preceding five years which have resulted in significant goodwill and other intangible asset balances 
our future business strategy contemplates that we may continue to pursue additional acquisitions in the future 
our accounting for acquisitions involves significant judgments and estimates primarily  but not limited to the fair value of certain forms of consideration  the fair value of acquired intangible assets  which involve projections of future revenue and cash flows  the fair value of other acquired assets and assumed liabilities  including potential contingencies  and the useful lives and  as applicable  the reporting unit  of the assets 
our financial position or results of operations may be materially impacted by changes in our initial assumptions and estimates relating to prior or future acquisitions 
additionally  under sfas  we determine the fair value of the reporting unit  for purposes of the first step in our annual goodwill impairment test  based on our market value 
if prior or future acquisitions are not accretive to our results of operations as expected  our market value declines dramatically  or we determine we have more than one 
table of contents reporting unit  we may be required to complete the second step which requires significant judgments and estimates and which may result in material impairment charges in the period in which they are determined 
accounting for long term facility obligations 
we have historically acquired companies which have previously established restructuring charges relating to lease exit costs  and we have recorded restructuring charges of our own that include lease exit costs 
we follow the provisions of eitf recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination or sfas accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities as applicable 
in accounting for these obligations  we are required to make assumptions relating to the time period over which the facility will remain vacant  sublease terms  sublease rates and discount rates 
we base our estimates and assumptions on the best information available at the time of the obligation having arisen 
these estimates are reviewed and revised as facts and circumstances dictate  changes in these estimates could have a material effect on the amount accrued on the balance sheet 
accounting for share based payments 
we account for share based payments in accordance with sfas r  share based payment 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating expected dividends  share price volatility and the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  share based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
pension and post retirement benefit plans 
we have defined benefit pension plans that were assumed as part of the acquisition of dictaphone corporation  which provide certain retirement and death benefits for former dictaphone employees located in the united kingdom and canada 
nuance also assumed a post retirement health care and life insurance benefit plan  which is frozen relative to new enrollment  and which provides certain post retirement health care and life insurance benefits  as well as a fixed subsidy for qualified former employees in the united states and canada 
we use several actuarial and other factors which attempt to estimate the ultimate expense  liability and assets values related to our pension and post retirement benefit plans 
these factors include assumptions about discount rates  expected return on plan assets and the rate of future compensation increases 
in addition  subjective assumptions  such as withdrawal and mortality rates  are also utilized 
the assumptions may differ materially from actual results due to the changing market and economic condition or other factors  and depending on their magnitude  could have a significant impact on the amount we recorded 
pension and post retirement benefit plan assumptions are included in note of notes to our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
nuance does not provide for us income taxes on the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries  which nuance considers to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the us in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for income taxes special areas 
nuance makes judgments regarding the realizability of its deferred tax assets 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes  the carrying value of the net deferred tax assets is based on the belief that it is more likely than not that nuance will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize these deferred tax assets after consideration of all available evidence 
nuance regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability  projected future taxable income  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies 
valuation allowances have been established for us deferred tax assets  which nuance believes do not meet the more likely than not criteria established by sfas if nuance is subsequently able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been established  then nuance may be required to recognize these deferred tax assets through the reduction of the valuation allowance which would result in a material benefit to its results of operations in the period in which the benefit is determined  excluding the recognition of the portion of the valuation allowance which relates to net deferred tax assets acquired in a business combination and created as a result of share based payments 
the recognition of the portion of the valuation allowance which relates to net deferred tax assets resulting from share based payments will be recorded as additional paid in capital 
the recognition of the 
table of contents portion of the valuation allowance which relates to net deferred tax assets acquired in a business combination will reduce goodwill  other intangible assets  and to the extent remaining  the provision for income taxes 
loss contingencies 
we are subject to legal proceedings  lawsuits and other claims relating to labor  service and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business  as discussed in note of notes to our consolidated financial statements 
quarterly  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas has as its objective to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently

the primary foreign currency denominated transactions include revenue and expenses and the resulting accounts receivable and accounts payable balances reflected on our balance sheet 
therefore  the change in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies will have either a positive or negative effect on our financial position and results of operations 
historically  our primary exposure has related to transactions denominated in the euro  british pound  canadian dollar  japanese yen  israeli new shekel  and hungarian forint 
assuming a appreciation or depreciation in foreign currency exchange rates from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at september   the impact to our revenue  operating results or cash flows could be adversely affected 
occasionally  we have entered into forward exchange contracts to hedge against foreign currency fluctuations 
these foreign currency exchange contracts are entered into as economic hedges  but are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes as defined under sfas the notional contract amount of these outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts was not material at september  and a hypothetical change of in exchange rates would not have a material impact on the financial results 
during the fiscal year ended and  the company recorded foreign exchange gains of million and a loss of million  respectively 
interest rate sensitivity we are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of our significant cash and cash equivalents  and the outstanding debt under the expanded credit facility 
at september   we held approximately million of cash and cash equivalents primarily consisting of cash and money market funds and million of short term marketable securities 
due to the low current market yields and the short term nature of our investments  a hypothetical change in market rates is not expected to have a material effect on the fair value of our portfolio or results of operations 
at september   our total outstanding debt balance exposed to variable interest rates was million 
to partially offset this variable interest rate exposure  nuance entered into a million interest rate swap derivative contract 
the interest rate swap is structured to offset period changes in the variable interest rate without changing the characteristics of the underlying debt instrument 
a hypothetical change in market rates would have a significant impact on the interest expense and amounts payable relating to the million of debt that is not offset by the interest rate swap  assuming a change in interest rates  the interest expense would increase million per annum
