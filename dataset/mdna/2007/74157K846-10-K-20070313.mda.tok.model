see why we use the term segment ebitda below 
background primedia was a broad based media enterprise resulting from a series of acquisitions and comprised of numerous disparate assets 
since  the company has been opportunistically divesting and acquiring selective properties in order to better focus on its core businesses and de leverage the company 
at december   the company s net debt was approximately  versus net debt and preferred stock of approximately  at december  the company has been positioning itself as a highly focused targeted media company and has invested in its businesses to drive growth 
additionally  to counter the effects of the weakness in the print advertising environment  the company has aggressively attacked its cost structure 
the company also realigned and reorganized its management structure to better reflect its emphasis on delivering products and brands to the marketplace to achieve organic growth 
these initiatives have resulted in charges for restructuring costs to integrate company operations and consolidate many back office functions and facilities  resulting in a significant reduction in the number of employees and office space  creating operational and financial efficiencies 
overall  these actions have made the company a more efficient organization with a strengthened balance sheet and improved liquidity 
business trends the print media industry continues to be adversely affected by the shift to alternative forms of advertising  an overall advertising environment that is softer than historical norms and declining newsstand sales of consumer magazines 
additionally  high levels of condominium conversions  coupled with lower mortgage rates have spurred housing purchases and limited existing and potential customers for apartment guide markets  while some markets experienced decreased vacancy rates and lower advertising spending

enthusiast media s strategy is to attract an increasing number of enthusiasts to its media properties  to capture a larger share of ad revenue and ultimately  to capture a growing portion of the thousands of dollars that enthusiasts spend on their avocations each year 
in the past  enthusiast media generated revenue primarily through advertising and magazine sales 
by adding automotive 
com and equine 
com to its portfolio  the business has extended its model to include fees for connecting buyers and sellers 
enthusiast media has positioned itself to capitalize on the shift away from mass advertising to targeted media 
the business strategy is to focus on its core targeted media businesses and to grow by leveraging and expanding its market leading brands 
enthusiast media has made organic growth its top priority  bolstered by select  opportunistic acquisitions 
consumer guides continued focusing on bringing the auto guide launches to profitability  and expanding its presence in the online marketplace for small unit rental properties with the acquisition of rentclicks 
com in early this segment of the market  which consists of rental houses  town homes  condos and single unit apartment accounts for approximately of the total rental market 
consumer guides believes that it can capture a new segment of the rental marketplace as well as recapture a portion of the apartment guide revenue lost to condominium conversion 
enthusiast media enthusiast media the enthusiast media segment produces and distributes content through magazines and via the internet to consumers in various niche and enthusiast markets 
it includes the company s automotive  recreation and lifestyles magazine groups  internet sites  events  and licensing and merchandising

expand internet operations and continue to diversify its revenue model enthusiast media has already successfully extended its print brands online  with over websites that have a combined million unique visitors and over million page views per month 
enthusiast media is now in the process of creating vertical specific portals that group its digital assets by vertical and provide its visitors with enhanced features and new online services 
enthusiast media s acquisitions in of automotive 
com and equine 
com were an important step in this direction 
both online properties are leading players in their respective verticals  with experienced management teams and state of the art platforms that can be leveraged across enthusiast media s portfolio of online assets 
improve product quality and optimize distribution enthusiast media continues to enhance the quality of the senior editorial and art director team 
in  over new staff members joined the editorial and art departments  including two new editors and two new art directors that were hired from outside the country 
historically  editorial oversight was managed by having the editors of individual titles report directly to publishers or business heads 
to ensure that enthusiast media realized the maximum benefit from its top editorial talent  the editorial reporting structure was modified  with like subject matter titles organized into groups 
each group is managed by a senior editor and art director 
these individuals are responsible for editing the largest publication in the group and for providing direction and support to the editors and art directors of the other publications in the group 
enthusiast media s strategic initiative to improve the product and editorial content of its magazines increased revenue  which well exceeded the redesign costs 
product and editorial content improvement and redesigns are expected to lead to additional improvement in both newsstand and subscription performance 
there are significant opportunities to apply this proven process to the remainder of the portfolio  particularly in the truck  motorcycle  marine and action sports segments  where none of the titles have gone through the process to date 
building on enthusiast media s redesign program  it has established a more coordinated effort to capitalize on the advertising  content and design expertise to increase efficiencies  manage costs and appropriately utilize talent 
the company continues to optimize circulation draw and distribution to improve profitability 
during  primedia reduced draw by million copies  or 
based on the success of the program  the company is implementing further reductions in capitalize on well known brands through product extensions and spin off publications due to management s lack of focus on product extensions up until  enthusiast media has only just begun to leverage its highly recognized brands and valued content through product and distribution channel extensions such as events  television  radio and licensing 
enthusiast media s auto shows and motorcycle events have resonated with enthusiasts across the country and enthusiast media is considering expanding the model further 
enthusiast media recently partnered with multicast networks group in its first television network  motor trend tv  which is scheduled to launch in if successful  enthusiast media could consider launching additional enthusiast media branded tv shows 
with household names like motor trend or hot rod  enthusiast media has also partnered with consumer product companies such as procter gamble and manufacturers such as auto trade and alltrade tools to co brand a wide variety of products  including car care products and automotive accessories 
enthusiast media plans to pursue these types of partnerships more aggressively  as part of its strategy to diversify its revenue base 
contribution margins on licensing are very high  so by further pursuing these opportunities  management expects to be able to achieve incremental bottom line growth with very little risk 
leverage the male audience to attract further non endemic national advertisers as one of the few media companies that reaches men between the ages of and through both print and digital media formats  enthusiast media continues to attract non endemic advertisers that target this highly valued demographic 
enthusiast media s major non endemic advertisers include geico  canon  procter gamble and campbell s 
non endemic advertising represents of total print advertising for the segment s business 
enthusiast media boasts entrenched relationships with several fortune companies 
as evidenced by the charts below  which show enthusiast media s advertising revenue from its top clients  enthusiast media enjoys a well diversified revenue base from its leading advertising clients  with the top advertisers accounting for less than of total revenue in enthusiast media s automotive groups also have a highly diversified client base  with us original equipment manufacturers oem s representing only of total print advertising sales 
non us oem advertising sales represent only of total print advertising revenue 
complement organic growth with a targeted and disciplined merger and acquisition strategy since its founding  enthusiast media has successfully grown its product portfolio through a disciplined approach of identifying and acquiring relatively small niche media businesses 
enthusiast media s business model is highly scalable and offers a unique platform for growth through add on acquisitions 
enthusiast media has focused on acquiring complementary titles and businesses that serve targeted customer bases within specific market segments 
acquisitions in these smaller  relatively less visible niches are typically below the radar screen of major media players and  therefore  are completed at comparatively low multiples because of the lack of competition 
in acquiring these businesses  enthusiast media prefers to retain management teams who are often highly entrepreneurial 
by retaining management talent and through the exchange and implementation of best practices  as well as cost savings directly attributable to economies of scale  enthusiast media has rapidly expanded its reach and improved its ability to serve a variety of customers

critical accounting policies critical accounting policies and estimates 
the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts  reserves for sales returns and allowances  provisions for restructuring costs  purchase price allocations  impairments of investments  divestiture reserves  the recoverability of long lived assets including goodwill and the valuation of equity instruments and allowances for income taxes 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates or assumptions form the basis of its judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates which would affect its reported results from operations 
the company believes the following is a description of the critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life are not amortized and are subject to impairment tests  at least annually 
the company does not amortize goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets primarily trademarks 
the company tests goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  and has established october as the annual impairment test date  using a fair value approach at the reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed regularly by management 
assets and liabilities of the company have been assigned to the reporting units to the extent that they are employed in or are considered a liability related to the operations of the reporting unit and are considered in determining the fair value of the reporting unit 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and for further discussion on sfas no 
long lived assets 
whenever significant events or changes occur  such as those affecting general market conditions or pertaining to a specific industry or an asset category  the company reviews the long lived assets for impairment 
when such factors  events or circumstances indicate that long lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment  the company uses an estimate of undiscounted cash flows over the remaining lives of the assets to measure recoverability 
if the estimated cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds fair value 
income taxes 
income taxes are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
management has determined that the company is not likely to realize the income tax benefit of its net deferred tax assets 
therefore  as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
in  the company continues to record a valuation allowance in excess of its net deferred tax assets to the extent the difference between the book and tax basis of indefinite lived intangible assets is not expected to reverse during the net operating loss carryforward period 
since amortization of tax deductible goodwill and trademarks ceased on january   the company will have deferred tax liabilities that will arise each quarter because the taxable temporary differences related to the amortization of these assets will not reverse prior to the expiration period of the company s deductible temporary differences unless the related assets are sold or an impairment of the assets is recorded 
stock based compensation 
the company has a stock based employee compensation plan 
prior to january   the company accounted for stock based compensation using the financial accounting standards board s sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  under the prospective method 
upon adoption  the company began expensing the fair value of stock based compensation for all grants  modifications or settlements made on or after january  effective january   the company adopted the provisions of  and accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
revised sfas no 
r  share based payment  which replaced sfas no 
and superseded apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
the company elected the modified prospective transition method  under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
the modified prospective transition method requires recognition of compensation expense from the beginning of the fiscal period in which the recognition provisions are first applied as if the fair value based accounting method had been used to account for all employees awards granted  modified  or settled after the effective date and to any awards that were not fully vested as of the effective date 
the adoption of sfas no 
r did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue when delivery has occurred  persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
advertising revenues for all consumer magazines are recognized as income at the on sale date  net of provisions for estimated rebates  adjustments and discounts 
other advertising revenues are generally recognized based on the publications cover dates 
online advertising is generally recognized when advertisements are run 
newsstand sales are recognized as revenue at the on sale date for all publications  net of provisions for estimated returns 
subscriptions are recorded as deferred revenue when received and recognized as revenue over the term of the subscription 
sales of books and other items are recognized as revenue upon shipment  net of an allowance for returns 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs  distribution costs charged to customers are recognized as revenue when the related product is shipped 
the company also derives revenue from various licensing agreements  which grant the licensee rights to use the trademarks and brand names of the company in connection with the manufacture and sale of certain designated products 
licensing revenue is generally recognized by the company pro rata over the life of the license agreement or as licenced products are sold 
from time to time  the company enters into multiple element arrangements whereby it may provide a combination of services including print advertising  content licensing  customer lists  on line advertising and other services 
in accordance with eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  revenue from each element is recorded when the following conditions exist the product or service provided represents a separate earnings process  the fair value of each element can be determined separately  and the undelivered elements are not essential to the functionality of a delivered element 
if the conditions for each element described above do not exist  revenue is recognized as earned using revenue recognition principles applicable to those elements as if it were one arrangement  generally on a straight line basis 
allowances for doubtful accounts allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated losses resulting from the company s customers failure to make required payments 
the company continually monitors collections from customers and provides a provision for estimated credit losses 
the company aggressively pursues collection efforts on these overdue accounts and upon collection reverses the write off in future periods 
if future payments by its customers were to differ from its estimates  the company may need to increase or decrease its allowances for doubtful accounts 
reserves for sales returns and allowances reserves for sales returns and allowances are primarily related to the company s newsstand sales 
the company estimates and maintains these reserves based primarily on its distributors historical return practices and its actual return experience 
if actual sales returns and allowances were to differ from its estimates  the company may need to increase or decrease its reserve for sales returns and allowances 
provision for restructuring costs reserves for restructuring costs are estimated costs resulting from management s plans and actions to integrate the company and consolidate certain back office functions 
if the future payments of these costs were to differ from its estimates  the company may need to increase or decrease its reserves 
divestiture reserves reserves for estimated obligations relating to divestitures may arise as a result of the sale of certain titles or business units 
these reserves are established for such items that the company remains liable for after the sale is completed and are recorded at the time of the divestiture as part of the gain or loss on the sale of the divested asset or business 
if the future payments for such items differ from its estimates  there could be a change in the determination of the gain or loss on sale
