item a risk factors the following is a discussion of significant risk factors relevant to grainger s business that could adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations 
a slowdown in economic activity could negatively impact grainger s sales growth 
economic and industry trends affect grainger s business environments 
grainger s sales growth has tended to correlate with commercial activity  manufacturing output and non farm employment levels 
thus  a slowdown in economic activity could negatively impact grainger s sales growth 
the facilities maintenance industry is a highly fragmented industry  and competition could result in a decreased demand for grainger s products and services 
there are several large competitors in the industry  although most of the market is served by small local and regional competitors 
grainger faces competition in all markets it serves  from manufacturers including some of its own suppliers that sell directly to certain segments of the market  wholesale distributors  catalog houses and retail enterprises 
competitive pressures could adversely affect grainger s sales and profitability 
unexpected product shortages could negatively impact customer relationships  resulting in an adverse impact on results of operations 
grainger s competitive strengths include product selection and availability 
products are purchased from approximately  key suppliers  no one of which accounts for more than of purchases 
historically  no significant difficulty has been encountered with respect to sources of supply 
if grainger were to experience difficulty in obtaining products  there could be a short term adverse effect on results of operations and a longer term adverse effect on customer relationships and reputation 
in addition  grainger has strategic relationships with key vendors 
in the event grainger was unable to maintain those relations  there might be a loss of competitive pricing advantages which could in turn adversely affect results of operations 
a delay in the implementation of grainger s multiyear market expansion program could negatively affect anticipated future sales growth 
in  grainger launched a six phase market expansion program to strengthen its presence in top metropolitan markets and better position itself to serve the local customer 
the program is being implemented in these markets in a phased approach 
the success of the market expansion program is expected to be a driver of growth in and beyond 
the first phase of the market expansion program was completed in phases two through six were in various stages of completion at december  a delay in the implementation of the program or lower than projected results from the program could negatively impact anticipated future sales growth 
the addition of new product lines could impact future sales growth 
grainger  from time to time  expands the breadth of its offerings by increasing the number of products it distributes 
in  grainger launched a multiyear product line expansion program 
the success of the expansion program is expected to be a driver of growth in and beyond 
the success of these expansions will depend on grainger s ability to accurately forecast market demand and to obtain product from suppliers 
interruptions in the proper functioning of information systems could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs or decreases in revenues  or both 
the proper functioning of grainger s information systems is critical to the successful operation of its business 
although grainger s information systems are protected through physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities exist  information systems are still vulnerable to natural disasters  power losses  unauthorized access  telecommunication failures and other problems 
if critical information systems fail or are otherwise unavailable  grainger s ability to process orders  identify business opportunities  maintain proper levels of inventories  collect accounts receivable and pay expenses could be adversely affected 
in order to compete  grainger must attract  retain and motivate key employees  and the failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
in order to compete and have continued growth  grainger must attract  retain and motivate executives and other key employees  including those in managerial  technical  sales  marketing and support positions 
there is no assurance that grainger will continue to be able to hire or retain key employees 
grainger competes to hire employees  and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies 
granger s operating results could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees  higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs

item legal proceedings grainger has been named  along with numerous other nonaffiliated companies  as a defendant in litigation in various states involving asbestos and or silica 
these lawsuits typically assert claims of personal injury arising from alleged exposure to asbestos and or silica as a consequence of products purportedly distributed by grainger 
as of january   grainger is named in cases filed on behalf of approximately  plaintiffs in which there is an allegation of exposure to asbestos and or silica 
in addition  five cases alleging exposure to cotton dust were amended during to add allegations relating to asbestos  but during the pleadings in those cases were amended and no longer contain allegations of asbestos exposure 
grainger has denied  or intends to deny  the allegations in all of the above described lawsuits 
in  lawsuits relating to asbestos and or silica and involving approximately plaintiffs were dismissed with respect to grainger  typically based on the lack of product identification 
if a specific product distributed by grainger is identified in any of these lawsuits  grainger would attempt to exercise indemnification remedies against the product manufacturer 
in addition  grainger believes that a substantial number of these claims are covered by insurance 
grainger is engaged in active discussions with its insurance carriers regarding the scope and amount of coverage 
while grainger is unable to predict the outcome of these lawsuits  it believes that the ultimate resolution will not have  either individually or in the aggregate  a material adverse effect on grainger s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in addition to the foregoing  from time to time grainger is involved in various other legal and administrative proceedings that are incidental to its business  including claims relating to product liability  general negligence  environmental issues  employment  intellectual property and other matters 
as a government contractor  from time to time grainger is also subject to governmental or regulatory inquiries or audits  including current inquiries relating to pricing compliance and trade agreement act compliance 
it is not expected that the ultimate resolution of any of these matters will have  either individually or in the aggregate  a material adverse effect on grainger s consolidated financial position or results of operations

critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses in the financial statements 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions  which it believes are reasonable 
if actual amounts are ultimately different from these estimates  the revisions are included in grainger s results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
accounting policies are considered critical when they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and when different estimates than those management reasonably could have made have a material impact on the presentation of grainger s financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates follow 
actual results in these areas could differ materially from management s estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
postretirement healthcare benefits 
postretirement obligations and net periodic costs are dependent on assumptions and estimates used in calculating such amounts 
the assumptions used include  among others  discount rates  assumed rates of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates 
changes in assumptions caused by conditions in equity markets or plan experience  for example could have a material effect on grainger s postretirement benefit obligations and expense  and could affect its results of operations and financial condition 
these changes in assumptions may also affect voluntary decisions to make additional contributions to the trust established for funding the postretirement benefit obligation 
the discount rate assumptions used by management reflect the rates available on high quality fixed income debt instruments as of december  the measurement date  of each year in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and net periodic postretirement benefit costs 
as of december   grainger increased the discount rate used in the calculation of its postretirement plan obligation from to to reflect the increase in market interest rates 
grainger estimates that the increase in the expected discount rate will increase pretax earnings by approximately million  although other changes in assumptions may increase  decrease or eliminate this effect 
grainger considers the long term historical actual return on plan assets and the historical performance of the standard poor s index in developing its expected long term return on plan assets 
in  grainger maintained the expected long term rate of return on plan assets of net of tax at based on the historical average of long term rates of return 
grainger may terminate or modify the postretirement plan at any time  subject to the provisions of the employee retirement income security act of erisa and the internal revenue code  as amended 
in the event the postretirement plan is terminated  all assets of the group benefit trust inure to the benefit of the participants 
the foregoing assumptions are based on the presumption that the postretirement plan will continue 
were the postretirement plan to terminate  different actuarial assumptions and other factors might be applicable 
grainger has used its best judgment in making assumptions and estimates and believes such assumptions and estimates used are appropriate 
changes to the assumptions may be required in future years as a result of actual experience or new trends and  therefore  may affect grainger s retirement plan obligations and future expense 
for additional information concerning postretirement healthcare benefits  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
insurance reserves 
grainger retains a significant portion of the risk of certain losses related to workers compensation  general liability and property losses through the utilization of deductibles and self insured retentions 
there are also certain other risk areas for which grainger does not maintain insurance 
grainger is responsible for establishing policies on insurance reserves 
although it relies on outside parties to project future claims costs  it retains control over actuarial assumptions  including loss development factors and claim payment patterns 
grainger performs ongoing reviews of its insured and uninsured risks  which it uses to establish the appropriate reserve levels 
the use of assumptions in the analysis leads to fluctuations in required reserves over time 
any change in the required reserve balance is reflected in the current period s results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
grainger uses several factors to estimate the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable including the age of the receivables and the historical ratio of actual write offs to the age of the receivables 
the analyses performed also take into consideration economic conditions that may have an impact on a specific industry  group of customers or a specific customer 
write offs could be materially different than the reserves provided if economic conditions change or actual results deviate from historical trends 
inventory reserves 
grainger establishes inventory reserves for shrinkage and excess and obsolete inventory 
provisions for inventory shrinkage are based on historical experience to account for unmeasured usage or loss 
actual inventory shrinkage could be materially different from these estimates affecting grainger s inventory values and cost of merchandise sold 
grainger regularly reviews inventory to evaluate continued demand and identify any obsolete or excess quantities of inventory 
grainger records provisions for the difference between excess and obsolete inventory and its estimated realizable value 
estimated realizable value is based on anticipated future product demand  market conditions and liquidation values 
actual results differing from these projections could have a material effect on grainger s results of operations 
income taxes 
grainger accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the tax balances and income tax expense recognized by grainger are based on management s interpretations of the tax laws of multiple jurisdictions 
income tax expense reflects grainger s best estimates and assumptions regarding  among other items  the level of future taxable income  interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities 
future rulings by tax authorities and future changes in tax laws and their interpretation  changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could impact the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by grainger 
other 
other significant accounting policies  not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above  are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements 
policies relating to revenue recognition  depreciation  intangibles  long lived assets and warranties require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple external sources of authoritative guidance such as the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission 
possible changes in estimates or assumptions associated with these policies are not expected to have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of grainger 
more information on these additional accounting policies can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements

see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of new accounting standards 
inflation and changing prices inflation during the last three years has not had a significant effect on operations 
the predominant use of the last in  first out lifo method of accounting for inventories and accelerated depreciation methods for financial reporting and income tax purposes result in a substantial recognition of the effects of inflation in the financial statements 
the major impact of inflation is on buildings and improvements  where the gap between historic cost and replacement cost continues for these long lived assets 
the related depreciation expense associated with these assets increases if adjustments were to be made for the cumulative effect of inflation 
grainger believes the most positive means to combat inflation and advance the interests of investors lies in the continued application of basic business principles  which include improving productivity  increasing working capital turnover and offering products and services which can command appropriate prices in the marketplace
