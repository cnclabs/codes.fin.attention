asset management segment business segment overview we operate an asset management business through our deephaven subsidiary 
deephaven is the registered investment manager and sponsor of certain private  unregistered funds commonly referred to as hedge funds the deephaven funds 
generally  hedge funds are defined as pools of capital that may invest in any asset class  including derivatives  and may use long and short positions  derivative instruments  and leverage in order to generate returns for investors 
a distinguishing feature of hedge funds is their use of long or short positions to seek to offset market risks and isolate arbitrage opportunities 
deephaven is based in minnetonka  mn  and also has offices in london and hong kong 
below is a summary of our assets under management at december   and  and the blended fund returns for each of the years then ended year end assets under management billions annual fund return to investors annual fund return represents the blended annual return across all assets under management 
we earn fees from managing the deephaven funds  which consist of annual management fees  calculated as fixed percentages of assets under management  and incentive fees  which  in general  are calculated as a percentage of the funds annual profits  if any 
the deephaven funds pay the trading and operating expenses associated with the deephaven funds 
in  the company entered into long term employment contracts with certain senior managers of deephaven 
these employment agreements  which became effective on january   had a three year term which expired on december  the agreements provided for profit sharing bonuses based on the financial performance of deephaven  which  for and  represented of pre tax earnings prior to the profit sharing bonuses 
the employment agreements also included an option for renewal by the deephaven managers through under identical financial terms  however  the renewal option was not exercised 
pursuant to the terms of a simultaneously executed option agreement between the company and these senior deephaven managers  in the event of a change of control of the company during the initial three year employment term  the deephaven senior managers had the option to obtain a interest in deephaven in exchange for the termination of their employment contracts and associated profit sharing bonuses 
as the company did not experience a change of control during the term of these employment contracts  this option expired 
in december  the company entered into new long term employment agreements with three senior managers of deephaven the deephaven managers  two of whom were parties to the agreements 
the new agreements  which became effective on january   are for three year terms and include a right of renewal by the deephaven managers through under certain circumstances 
the new employment agreements provide profit sharing bonuses based on the financial performance of deephaven 
according to the terms of the contracts  the deephaven managers will receive of the first million  and thereafter  of pre tax earnings prior to the profit sharing bonuses 
the deephaven managers also received one million shares of knight restricted common stock  which vest ratably over three years 
effective january   the deephaven managers were also granted an option the option  exercisable after january  and until december   and conditioned on meeting certain requirements  to obtain a interest in deephaven or a new limited liability company to which the company s interests in deephaven 
table of contents would be contributed in exchange for the termination of their new employment agreements and associated profit sharing bonuses 
the agreement also provides that in the event of a change of control of the company following january  and prior to december   the deephaven managers would have the option the change of control option  in exchange for the termination of their new employment contracts and associated profit sharing bonuses  to obtain a interest in deephaven or  if the option has already been exercised  to increase their interest resulting from the exercise of the option by an additional 
following any exercise of the option or change of control option by the deephaven managers  pre tax earnings prior to profit sharing will be allocated between knight and the deephaven managers in the same manner as under the new employment agreements 
during the life of the option  the agreements provide that the company may not sell deephaven without the approval of the deephaven managers 
clients and products investors in the deephaven funds include banks  insurance companies  funds of hedge funds  corporate and public pension plan sponsors  trusts  endowments and private clients among others 
we differentiate ourselves based on our reputation  client relationships  experience of the management team  investment strategies  risk profile and historical fund returns 
included within deephaven s billion of assets under management as of december  is a corporate investment of approximately million held by the company and approximately million of investments held by employee deferred compensation plans and certain officers  directors and employees of the company 
as of december   no investor accounted for more than of the deephaven funds assets under management 
as of december   approximately of the deephaven funds assets under management were in the deephaven market neutral funds market neutral fund 
the investment philosophy for the market neutral fund is to seek to produce returns for its investors using various investment strategies focusing on delivering attractive risk adjusted rates of return 
the performance of the market neutral fund is intended to be substantially non correlated with the general debt and equity markets  as well as with a number of other non traditional investment strategies 
its returns are primarily dependent upon equity trading volumes  equity volatility  mergers and acquisitions and secondary offering activity in the capital markets  and credit spread relationships  among other factors 
within the market neutral fund  deephaven generally employs a variety of investment strategies  including event driven  volatility driven  fundamental equity  credit driven and global macro strategies  among others 
there is no material limitation on the types of investment strategies that may be employed by the market neutral fund 
in the second quarter of  deephaven launched a new single strategy fund  the deephaven event fund event fund 
the investment strategy of the event fund is event arbitrage  which involves investing in securities of issuers subject to event driven situations  such as  mergers  acquisitions  corporate restructurings  spin offs  or trade opportunities from market imbalances created by these types of transactions 
the arbitrage aspects of the event fund s strategy involve an assessment of the likelihood that the transaction will be consummated and the resulting determination of how large an exposure to acquire  as well as how and when to hedge such exposure 
as of december   the event fund held approximately billion in assets under management  or approximately of the deephaven funds assets under management 
the employment contract of the portfolio manager of the event fund and event driven strategies expired on december  deephaven hired a new portfolio manager for the event fund and event driven strategies effective january  deephaven also manages other single strategy funds as well as several separately managed accounts for institutional investors 
as of december   these single strategy funds and all separately managed accounts had  in aggregate  approximately million of assets under management  comprising approximately of the deephaven funds assets under management 
in order to offer additional product choices for its investor base  deephaven may  in the future  look to increase the number of single strategy funds it manages 
deephaven is continuing to increase the allocation of its assets under management invested in europe and asia 

table of contents asset management competition deephaven competes primarily with other asset management companies that manage and sponsor multi strategy  event driven  credit driven  long short equity and volatility driven portfolios 
as deephaven launches new single strategy funds  it will compete with other asset management companies with similar investment strategies 
competition is primarily based on reputation  client relationships  the experience of the management team  investment strategies  risk profile  fee structures and historical fund returns 
we believe that deephaven s status as a voluntary registered investment adviser also differentiates our product offering and may enable deephaven to attract additional assets under management from investors who previously would not invest in hedge funds managed by non registered investment advisers 
there has been an on going trend among fund management companies and institutions to allocate more of their assets to hedge fund investments 
this has influenced the growth of the hedge fund industry  as shown in the table below 
the continued growth of the hedge fund industry may provide for greater competition in the future 
estimated number of hedge funds estimated total assets under management millions source hedge fund research  inc industry report asset management infrastructure in managing the deephaven funds  asset management uses both an in house developed proprietary order management system and a third party portfolio management system 
deephaven has business continuity capabilities in place in the event it is unable to access or operate in its current locations 
global markets segment business segment overview we offer superior execution quality through natural liquidity  capital facilitation and trading technology  with comprehensive products and services that support the capital formation process 
we make a market or trade in nearly every us equity security and provide trade execution services in a large number of international securities  futures  options  foreign currencies and fixed income instruments 
our business model focuses on providing comprehensive trade execution services as well as superior client service 
to do so  the model requires that we manage risk effectively as well as maintain efficient and reliable trading technology 
substantially all of our global markets revenues and profitability come from our operations in the us the majority of our global markets revenue comes from making markets and providing trade execution services in us equities 
generally  market makers display the prices at which they are willing to bid  meaning buy  or offer  meaning sell  securities and adjust their bid and offer prices in response to the forces of supply and demand for each security 
as a market maker operating in nasdaq  the nasdaq intermarket  the over the counter otc market for new york stock exchange nyse and american stock exchange amex listed securities  and the otc bulletin board  we provide trade executions by offering to buy securities from  or sell securities to  institutions and broker dealers

we also provide trade executions on an agency or riskless principal basis  generating commissions or commission equivalents  respectively 
we execute the majority of our equity transactions as principal 

table of contents our domestic global markets activities are primarily transacted out of six subsidiaries  knight equity markets  lp kem  knight capital markets llc kcm  direct trading institutional  lp direct trading  direct edge ecn llc direct edge  hotspot fx  inc and its subsidiaries hotspot and valubond securities  inc valubond

our international global markets activities are primarily operated through knight equity markets international limited kemil  a uk registered broker dealer authorized and regulated by the financial services authority fsa that provides execution services for predominately european institutional and broker dealer clients in us  european and international equities 
we intend to continue to expand our institutional business and product offerings in europe in over the past two years  we have completed the following acquisitions of complementary businesses to strengthen our global markets business segment and expand our product offerings in june  the company acquired  for cash  the business of direct trading  a privately held firm specializing in providing institutions with direct market access trading through an advanced electronic platform  now known as knight direct

clients and products clients within global markets  we offer products and provide services primarily to two main client groups broker dealers and institutions 
our broker dealer clients primarily include global  national and regional broker dealers and on line brokers 
our institutional clients primarily include mutual funds  pension plans  plan sponsors  hedge funds  trusts and endowments 
based on our internal allocation methodologies  our institutional clients which include our direct market access  soft dollar and commission recapture clients and our broker dealer clients which include our direct edge ecn clients each generated approximately of our global markets revenues in 
table of contents in  our largest broker dealer client accounted for approximately of the global market s us equity dollar value traded 
no other client accounted for over of our us equity dollar value traded 
products and services our strategy for our global markets segment is to continue to differentiate ourselves from competitors by providing high quality and competitive trade execution services with superior client service 
over the past three years  we have worked to aggressively expand our product offering 
we offer institutions comprehensive  unbundled trade execution services covering the depth and breadth of the market 
we handle large  complex trades  accessing liquidity from our order flow as well as other sources 
when liquidity is not naturally present in the market  we offer capital facilitation to complete our clients trades 
our institutional products include equity  futures  options and foreign currency trade execution solutions  block trading  program trading  international equities  special situations risk arbitrage  soft dollar and commission recapture programs donaldson  corporate services  technical research knight technical research  direct market access knight direct and crossing networks knight match 
the majority of our revenues from institutional clients are commissions on agency transactions or commission equivalents on riskless principal transactions 
we seek to provide broker dealers with high quality and competitive trade executions that enable them to satisfy their fiduciary obligations to their customers to seek and obtain the best execution reasonably available in the marketplace 
most of our equity order flow comes from providing market making and execution services to our broker dealer clients 
we execute the majority of the order flow from broker dealer clients as principal 
the majority of the revenues we earn from broker dealer clients are net trading revenues  generated from the difference between the price paid when securities are bought and the price received when those securities are sold 
we also provide fixed income and foreign currency trade executions to our broker dealers clients 
global markets competition the securities industry is constantly evolving and intensely competitive  a trend that we expect will continue 
our market making product competes primarily with similar products offered by global  national  and regional broker dealers  the nyse  the amex  nasdaq  regional exchanges and alternative trading systems  such as ecns and dark books 
we have also experienced greater competition from market making firms with highly automated  electronic trading models 
another source of competition comes from broker dealers who execute portions of their client flow through internal market making desks rather than sending the client flow to third party execution destinations  such as knight 
we compete primarily on the basis of our execution standards including price  liquidity and speed  client relationships  client service  payments for order flow and technology 
over the past several years  regulatory changes  competition and the continued focus by regulators and investors on execution quality and overall transaction costs have resulted in a market environment characterized by narrowed spreads and reduced revenue capture metrics 
consequently  maintaining profitability has become extremely difficult for many market makers 
generally  improvements in execution quality  such as faster execution speed and greater price improvement  negatively impact the ability to derive revenues from executing broker dealer order flow 
for example  we have made  and continue to make  changes to our execution protocols  which have had  or could have  a significant impact on our profitability 
to remain profitable  some market makers have limited or ceased activity in illiquid or marginally profitable securities or  conversely  have sought to execute a greater volume of trades at a lower cost by increasing the automation and efficiency of their operations 
in and  we significantly increased the amount of automation in our market making business  and we now execute most of our trades on an automated basis 
competition for order flow in the us equity markets continues to be intense in connection with publicly disclosed execution metrics  ie  sec rules and these rules  applicable to broker dealers  add greater 
table of contents disclosure to execution quality and order routing practices 
rule requires market centers that trade national market system securities to make available to the public monthly electronic reports that include uniform statistical measures of execution quality on a security by security basis 
rule requires broker dealers that route equity and option orders on behalf of their customers to make publicly available quarterly reports that describe their order routing practices and disclose the venues to which customer orders are routed for execution 
these statistics on execution quality vary by order sender based on their mix of business 
this rule also requires the disclosure of payment for order flow arrangements as well as internalization practices 
the intent of this rule is to encourage routing of order flow to destinations based primarily on the demonstrable quality of executions at those destinations  supported by the order entry firms fiduciary obligations to seek to obtain best execution for their customers orders 
commission rates have been under pressure for a number of years  and the ability to execute trades electronically through the internet and through other alternative trading systems for example  through ecns  direct market access or crossing networks has increased the pressure on trading commissions 
it appears that this trend toward alternative trading systems will continue 
we may experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing prices 
competition for business from institutional clients is based on a variety of factors  including execution quality  equity research  reputation  soft dollar and commission recapture services  technology  client relationships  client service  cost and capital facilitation 
based on industry surveys  approximately of institutional equity commissions have historically been allocated to broker dealers in exchange for either research or soft dollar and commission recapture services 
these industry surveys also indicate that execution quality is one of the primary reasons why institutions allocate commissions to broker dealers other than for research or soft dollar and commission recapture services 
with our acquisition of the business of donaldson co 
donaldson in  we strengthened the soft dollar and commission recapture services we provide to our clients 
in  we also established a new research division  knight technical research  to provide unbundled market analysis to our institutional client base 
in the future  due partly to the regulatory scrutiny over the past few years relating to equity research and the continued focus by investors on execution quality and overall transaction costs  we believe that a greater percentage of institutional commissions will be allocated based on the quality of executions 
however  there is no guarantee that this will occur 
another factor contributing to the increase in competition for order flow is the significant mergers among us market centers over the past several years  and the launch of independent ecns and joint ventures with regional stock exchanges 
the effects of these mergers and the launch of new competition  as well as the expected consolidation of certain us and international stock exchanges  will be seen in the coming years 
global markets infrastructure we have invested a significant amount of resources in order to expand our execution capacity and upgrade our trading systems and infrastructure and plan to continue to make additional investments in technology in our ability to identify and deploy emerging technologies that facilitate the execution of trades is key to the successful execution of our business model 
not only has technology enhanced our capacity and ability to handle order flow faster  it has also been an important component of our strategy to comply with government regulations  achieve competitive execution standards  increase trading automation and provide superior client service 
in  we automated the majority of our execution services for broker dealer order flow through our internally developed quantitative models 
we continued this process in which contributed to the improvement of global markets financial results 
we plan to enhance our use of technology and quantitative models to further automate our execution services 
we use our proprietary technology and technology licensed from third parties to execute trades  monitor the performance of our traders  assess our inventory positions  manage risk and provide ongoing information to our clients 
we are electronically linked to institutions and broker dealers to provide immediate access to our trading operations and to facilitate the handling of client orders 
our business to business portal and our proprietary direct market access technology  knight direct  provide our clients with an array of web based tools to interact 
table of contents with our global markets trading systems and most us equity  futures and options market centers 
broker dealers  both foreign and domestic  use this portal to send us order flow  access reports and use the other tools it offers to facilitate their business 
alternative trading and data center facilities are in place for our primary domestic global markets operations 
these facilities have been designed to allow us to continue a substantial portion of our operations if we are prevented from accessing or utilizing our primary office locations for an extended period of time 
corporate segment the corporate segment includes all costs not associated with our two primary operating segments  primarily corporate overhead expenses 
corporate overhead expenses primarily consist of compensation for certain senior executives and other individuals employed at the corporate holding company  legal and other professional expenses relating to corporate matters  director s fees  investor and public relations expenses and directors and officers insurance 
this segment also includes the investment income earned on our strategic investments and our corporate investment in the deephaven funds 
the results from our corporate segment were positively impacted in and by realized gains from the sales of our strategic equity investments in the international securities exchange  inc ise and the nasdaq stock market  inc nasdaq 
intellectual property and other proprietary rights our success and ability to compete are dependent to a degree on our intellectual property  which includes our proprietary technology  trade secrets and client base 
we rely primarily on trade secret  trademark  domain name  patent and contract law to protect our intellectual property 
it is our policy to enter into confidentiality  intellectual property ownership and or non competition agreements with our employees  independent contractors and business partners  and to control access to and distribution of our intellectual property 
government regulation and market structure most aspects of the company s business are subject to extensive securities regulation under federal  state and international laws 
the sec  nasd  fsa  cftc  msrb  nfa  other self regulatory organizations commonly known as sros  and other regulatory bodies  such as state securities commissions  promulgate numerous rules and regulations 
as a matter of public policy  regulatory bodies are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of investors in those markets 
regulated entities are subject to regulations concerning all aspects of their business  including trade practices  best execution practices  capital structure  record retention and the conduct of officers  supervisors and registered employees 
failure to comply with any of these laws  rules or regulations could result in administrative or court proceedings  censures  fines  the issuance of cease and desist orders or injunctions  or the suspension or disqualification of the entity and or its officers  supervisors or registered employees 
we  and certain of our past and present officers  directors and employees  have in the past been subject to claims alleging the violation of such laws  rules and regulations 
we are subject to several of these matters as further described in legal proceedings in part i  item herein 
certain aspects of the company s public disclosure  corporate governance principles  internal control environment and the roles of auditors and counsel are subject to the sarbanes oxley act of and related regulations and rules of the sec and nasdaq 
rule making by the sec  nasd  cftc  msrb  nfa and corresponding market structure changes  can have  and have had an impact on the company s regulated subsidiaries by directly affecting our method of operation and profitability 
legislation such as the usa patriot act of has imposed significant obligations on broker dealers and mutual funds 
these increased obligations require the implementation and maintenance of internal practices  procedures and controls which have increased our costs and may subject us to regulatory inquiries  claims or penalties 
the regulatory environment in which we operate our global markets business segment is subject to constant change 
our business  financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected as a result of new or 
table of contents revised legislation or regulations imposed by the us congress  the sec  cftc  other united states or foreign governmental regulatory authorities  the nasd  the nfa and other sros or regulatory bodies 
additional regulations  changes in existing laws and rules  or changes in interpretations or enforcement of existing laws and rules often directly affect the method of operation and profitability of regulated broker dealers 
we cannot predict what effect  if any  such changes might have 
for example  in june  the sec adopted rules under its regulation nms designed to modernize and strengthen the regulatory structure of the us equity markets 
although many components of regulation nms may strengthen our national market system  certain components of the proposal ie  the trade through rule may have the potential for causing greater harm than good to the marketplace 
moreover  it is possible that regulation nms and its associated rules could negatively impact our global markets business 
regulation nms is scheduled to begin implementation in march the recent expansion of many regional exchanges  in which several exchanges are seeking to create their own alternative trading systems eg  ecns and compete in the otc and listed trading venues  as well as other independent ecns  could also negatively impact our global markets business 
we have foreign based subsidiaries 
the brokerage industry in many foreign countries is heavily regulated  much like the us the varying compliance requirements of these different regulatory jurisdictions and other factors may limit our ability to conduct business or expand internationally 
for example  the markets in financial instruments directive mifid adopted by the european commission  is scheduled for implementation in november mifid represents one of the more significant changes to take place in the operation of european capital markets 
it is possible that mifid and its associated rules and directives could negatively impact our global markets business 
our asset management subsidiary  deephaven  became registered as an investment adviser with the sec in registration as an investment adviser has resulted in additional regulatory responsibilities and obligations on deephaven s business compared to those prior to registration 
deephaven is also registered with the cftc and is a member of the nfa as a commodity pool operator and a commodity trading adviser 
due to the nature of deephaven s client base  however  deephaven is exempt from many of the cftc nfa regulations 
deephaven s uk subsidiary is regulated by the fsa and deephaven s hong kong subsidiary is regulated by the hong kong securities and futures commission 
the company believes that it is in material compliance with applicable regulations 
net capital requirements certain of our subsidiaries are subject to the sec s net capital rule 
this rule  which specifies minimum net capital requirements for registered broker dealers  is designed to measure the general financial integrity and liquidity of a broker dealer and requires that at least a minimum part of its assets be kept in relatively liquid form 
in general  net capital is defined as net worth assets minus liabilities  plus qualifying subordinated borrowings and certain discretionary liabilities  less certain mandatory deductions that result from excluding assets that are not readily convertible into cash and from valuing conservatively certain other assets 
among these deductions are adjustments  commonly called haircuts  which reflect the possibility of a decline in the market value of an asset before disposition  and non allowable assets 
failure to maintain the required net capital may subject a firm to suspension or revocation of registration by the sec  and suspension or expulsion by the nasd and other regulatory bodies  and ultimately could require the firm s liquidation 
the net capital rule prohibits payments of dividends  redemption of stock  the prepayment of subordinated indebtedness and the making of any unsecured advance or loan to a stockholder  employee or affiliate  if such payment would reduce the firm s net capital below required levels 
a change in the net capital rule  the imposition of new rules or any unusually large charges against net capital could limit those operations that require the intensive use of capital and also could restrict our ability to withdraw capital from our broker dealer subsidiaries 
a significant operating loss or any unusually large charge against net capital could adversely affect our ability to expand or even maintain our present levels of business 

table of contents certain of our foreign subsidiaries are subject to capital adequacy requirements set by their respective regulators 
during  our significant broker dealer subsidiaries  including kem and kcm  were in compliance with their capital adequacy requirements 
for additional discussion related to net capital  see footnote net capital requirements included in part ii
