item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this report includes forward looking statements 
generally  the words believes  anticipates  may  will  should  expect  intend  estimate  continue  and similar expressions or the negative thereof or comparable terminology are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties  including the matters set forth in this report or other reports or documents we file with the securities and exchange commission from time to time  which could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those projected 
undue reliance should not be placed on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date hereof 
we undertake no obligation to update these forward looking statements 
to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with gaap  we discuss our results in terms of financial measures that may be deemed to be non gaap financial measures under the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission 
our management believes that these measures provide meaningful information regarding the company s performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses that may not be indicative of its core operating results and facilitate comparisons to its historical operations and competitors operating results 
to the extent such measures are not readily reconcilable to the comparable gaap financial measures contained in its consolidated financial statements  we provide detailed reconciliations that permit investors to determine how such non gaap financial measures have been derived 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto and other financial information contained elsewhere in this form k 
overview headquartered in shandong province  prc  new dragon asia corp 
is engaged in the milling  sale and distribution of flour and related products  including instant noodles and soybean derived products  to retail and wholesale customers throughout china 
with a well known brand name called long feng  we market our well established product line through a countrywide network of more than key distributors and regional offices in chinese provinces 
we have six manufacturing plants in the prc with an aggregate production capacity of approximately  tons of flour and approximately billion packets of instant noodles and  tons of soybean powder 
operation plan our current strategies are to acquire additional plants to enlarge our capacity  and to build strategic alliances with multinational food groups to enhance product range and capitalize on our china distribution network 
plans for expansion of the existing plants are expected to be funded through current working capital from ongoing sales 
a significant acquisition will require additional funds in the form of debt or equity  or a combination of both 
however  there can be no assurance these funds will be available 
establishment and acquisitions in delta link limited chengdu plant on february   the company acquired of the equity interest shares of delta link ltd 
delta link for a cash consideration of  delta link is a holding company  which owns a equity interest in a noodle manufacturing facility in chengdu  sichuan province 
the chengdu plant serves the western china market 
this acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method pursuant to sfas no 
 business combinations 
the consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of these acquired companies commencing as of the acquisition date 
no pro forma information is presented due to the immaterial effect of this acquisition on the consolidated result of operations 
in connection with the acquisition  the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed from delta link and the chengdu plant were recorded at their fair values on the consolidated balance sheet 
based on the initial purchase price allocation  the company recorded goodwill in the amount of approximately  the long lived assets and goodwill are subject to periodic review to determine if impairment has occurred and  if so  the amount of such impairment 
if the company determines that impairment exists  the company will be required to reduce the carrying value of the impaired assets by the amount of impairment and to record a corresponding charge to operations in the period of impairment

ndapm is principally engaged in the manufacturing and sale of packing materials  with a registered capital of  year ended december  compared to year ended december  selected information from the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december  net revenue cost of goods sold selling and distribution expenses general and administrative expenses including stock based compensation of  for loss on fair value adjustments to embedded derivatives vat refund net income loss ebitda ebitda margin on revenue the company uses ebitda as an operating performance measure 
ebitda is defined as net earnings loss before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization expense and in our case loss gain on fair value adjustments to embedded derivatives 
ebitda is not a measure of operating performance under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and should not be considered as an alternative or substitute for gaap profitability measures such as operating earnings loss and net earnings loss 
ebitda as an operating performance measure has material limitations since it excludes  among other things  the statement of operations impact of depreciation and amortization expense  interest expense  the provision benefit for income taxes and loss gain on fair value adjustments to embedded derivatives and therefore does not necessarily represent an accurate measure of profitability  particularly in situations where a company is highly leveraged or has a disadvantageous tax structure 
the company uses a significant amount of capital assets and depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of the company s costs and ability to generate revenue and therefore its exclusion from ebitda is a material limitation 
the company generally incurs significant income taxes each year and the provision benefit for income taxes is a necessary element of the company s costs and therefore its exclusion from ebitda is a material limitation 
as a result  ebitda should be evaluated in conjunction with net earnings loss for a more complete analysis of the company s profitability  as net earnings loss includes the financial statement impact of these items and is the most directly comparable gaap operating performance measure to ebitda 
as ebitda is not defined by gaap  the company s definition of ebitda may differ from and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies  thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
because of the limitations that ebitda has as an analytical tool  investors should not consider it in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of the company s operating results as reported under gaap

inflation and changing prices the company does not foresee any adverse effects on its earnings as a result of inflation or changing prices 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made  and if different estimates that reasonable could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
management believes that the following reflect the more critical accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition our revenues are generated from sales of flour and instant noodle 
all of our revenue transactions contain standard business terms and conditions 
we determine the appropriate accounting for these transactions after considering whether a contract exists  when to recognize revenue on the deliverables  and whether all elements of the contract have been fulfilled and delivered 
in addition  our revenue recognition policy requires an assessment as to whether collection is reasonably assured  which inherently requires us to evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers 
changes in judgments on these assumptions and estimates could materially impact the timing or amount of revenue recognition 
accounting for derivative instruments statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  requires all derivatives to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
these derivatives  including embedded derivatives in our series a b preferred stock  are separately valued and accounted for on our balance sheet 
where market prices are not readily available  fair values are determined using market based pricing models incorporating readily observable market data and requiring judgment and estimates 
the pricing model we use for determining fair values of our derivatives is a combination of the black scholes and binomial pricing models 
valuations derived from this model are subject to ongoing internal and external review 
the model uses market sourced inputs such as interest rates  exchange rates  and option volatilities 
selection of these inputs involves management s judgment and may impact net income 
the company has obtained a valuation report from a valuation firm to support its estimates 
in september  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  eitf which requires freestanding contracts that are settled in a company s own stock  including common stock warrants  to be designated as an equity instrument  asset or a liability 
under the provisions of eitf  a contract designated as an asset or a liability must be carried at fair value on a company s balance sheet  with any changes in fair value recorded in the company s results of operations 
a contract designated as an equity instrument must be included within equity  and no fair value adjustments are required 
in accordance with eitf  in august  we determined that several of the outstanding warrants to purchase our common stock and the embedded conversion feature of our financial instruments  should be separately accounted for as liabilities 
we have recorded the fair value of these warrants and conversion features on our balance sheet and record unrealized changes in the values of these derivatives in our consolidated statement of operations as loss on fair value adjustments to embedded derivatives for the year ended december  stock based compensation on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on the grant date fair value of the award 
sfas no 
r was to be effective for interim or annual reporting periods beginning on or after june   but in april the sec issued a rule that will permit most registrants to implement sfas no 
r at the beginning of their next fiscal year  instead of the next reporting period as required by sfas no 
r 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no 
no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
under sfas no 
r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive options  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas no 
r  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
we have adopted the requirements of sfas no 
r for the fiscal year beginning on december   and recorded the compensation expense for all unvested stock options 
contractual joint ventures a contractual joint venture is an entity established between the company and another joint venture partner  with the rights and obligations of each party governed by a contract 
currently  the company has established three contractual joint ventures with three chinese partners in china  with percentage of ownership ranging from to 
pursuant to each chinese joint venture agreement  each chinese joint venture partner is entitled to receive a pre determined annual fee and is not responsible for any profit or loss  regardless of the ownership in the contractual joint venture 
in view of such contracted profit sharing arrangement  the three contractual joint ventures are regarded as owned by the company 
hence  the company s consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the contractual joint ventures 
allowance for doubtful accounts management provides for an allowance for doubtful accounts for those third party trade accounts that are not collected within one year 
we base our estimate one year on historical experience and on continuous monitoring of customers credit and settlement 
we believe we have reasonable basis for making judgments on the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we normally grant up to days credit to our customers 
we monitor our allowance for doubtful accounts on a monthly basis 
the provisions and write offs during and reflect the estimates made by management approximate to the actual results 
the net profit and loss impact of the provision and write off on and are and  respectively  which have an insignificant impact on the net income of both years 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost  determined on a weighted average basis  or net realizable value 
costs of work in progress and finished goods are composed of direct material  direct labor and an attributable portion of manufacturing overhead 
net realizable value is the estimated selling price  in the ordinary course of business  less estimated costs to complete and dispose 
recent accounting pronouncements on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment revised  using the modified prospective transition method as described in note in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
this interpretation prescribes a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on recognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  ie  the beginning of our fiscal year 
we do not expect that the adoption of fin will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value instruments 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements  but applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  our fiscal 
we believe that implementation of sfas will have little or no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas 
sfas requires plan sponsors of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans collectively  postretirement benefit plans to fully recognize the funded status of their postretirement benefit plans in the statement of financial position  measure the fair value of plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the fiscal year end statement of financial position and provide additional disclosures 
we believe that implementation of sfas will have little or no impact on our consolidated financial statements since we have no applicable plans 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab  to address diversity in practice in quantifying financial statement misstatements 
sab requires that we quantify misstatements based on their impact on each of our financial statements and related disclosures 
on december   we adopted sab our adoption of sab did not impact our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we may be exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of business 
market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur as a result of movements in interest rates and equity prices 
we currently do not use financial instruments in the normal course of business that are subject to changes in financial market conditions 
currency fluctuations and foreign currency risk the majority of our operations are conducted in the prc except for some minor export business and limited overseas purchases of raw materials 
most of our sales and purchases are conducted within the prc in chinese renminbi 
hence  the effect of the fluctuations of exchange rate is considered minimal to our business operations 
substantially all of our revenues and expenses are denominated in renminbi  which is the official currency of china 
however  we use the united states dollar for financial reporting purposes 
conversion of renminbi into foreign currencies is regulated by the people s bank of china through a unified floating exchange rate system 
although the prc government has stated its intention to support the value of renminbi  there can be no assurance that such exchange rate will not again become volatile or that renminbi will not devalue significantly against the us dollar 
exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect the value  in us dollar terms  of the our net assets and income derived from its operations in the prc 
interest rate risk the company does not have significant interest rate risk  as our debt obligations are primarily short term in nature  with fixed interest rates 
our embedded derivatives liabilities are revalued each accounting period and their fair value can be affected by interest rate fluctuations based on changes in the risk free interest rate generally the interest rate on intermediate term obligations of the united states government 
credit risk we have not experienced significant credit risk as most of our customers are long term customers with outstanding payment records 
our receivables regularly by monitored by our credit manager
