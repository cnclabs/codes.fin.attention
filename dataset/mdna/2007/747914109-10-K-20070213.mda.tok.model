the ohms cvd system continuously monitors the care process  and thus  results are reported as outcomes 
at november   we had contracts with the center for medicare and medicaid services and health plans to provide disease management services in multiple health plan markets in states 
the number of members under contract was as follows at november  approximate members under contract at november   of the approximately  plan members under contract  we had approximately  commercial members and  medicare advantage members 
the reduction in members under contract in was related to the contract terminations with alere medical and the bipa medicare disease management project see medicare demonstration projects section that occurred at the end of december and february  respectively 
medicare demonstration projects the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms selected us to participate in two demonstration projects medicare coordinated care demonstration mccd  and bipa medicare disease management demonstration cms is a federal agency within the us department of health and human services 
cms runs the medicare and medicaid programs two national health care programs that benefit millions of americans 
cms  with the departments of labor and treasury  helps millions of americans and small companies get and keep health insurance coverage  and eliminate discrimination based on health status for people buying health insurance 
cms spends billions of dollars a year buying health care services for beneficiaries of medicare  medicaid and schip 
cms among other things assures that the medicaid  medicare and schip programs are properly run by its contractors and state agencies  establishes policies for paying health care providers  conducts research on the effectiveness of various methods of health care management  treatment  and financing  and assesses the quality of health care facilities and services and takes enforcement actions as appropriate 
medicare coordinated care demonstration in fiscal  we received a contract award to participate in the medicare mccd project 
our ohms cad program is the only one under this demonstration that will be evaluated specifically for management of cad 
cms designed mccd to evaluate the cost effectiveness of reimbursing disease management services in the medicare fee for service model 
in accordance with the balanced budget act of  which mandated the demonstration  cms may issue regulations to implement  on a permanent basis  the components of the demonstration projects that are proven to be cost effective for the medicare program 
under the award  we are implementing our ohms cad disease management technology in a controlled randomized study of medicare beneficiaries who have been diagnosed previously with cad 
patient enrollment in california commenced in early as a result of our success in the initial enrollment stage of the project  cms authorized doubling the patient base of the project with commensurate remuneration 
this project was originally scheduled to end in january but has been extended by cms through june  bipa medicare disease management demonstration on october   cms selected qmed  inc  pacificare health systems  inc  with its subsidiary  prescription solutions  and alere medical  inc operating jointly as heartpartners to participate in its bipa disease management demonstration project 
the heartpartners program provided disease management services and a comprehensive tiered prescription drug plan for chronically ill medicare fee for service beneficiaries suffering from congestive heart failure 
the program also addressed the significant co morbidities of coronary artery disease and diabetes 
pacificare health systems  inc notified cms that pacificare intended to terminate this project not later than february  and cms agreed to allow pacificare to terminate this contract effective february  this termination resulted in a reduction in disease management revenue of approximately million in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year qmedcare  inc as a result of the medicare modernization act of mma  new business opportunities were created by the creation of special needs plans for chronically ill medicare beneficiaries 
we have entered this market through our wholly owned subsidiary qmedcare  inc qmedcare  inc acts as a management company that will assist with the operations of a series of specialty managed care products serving a high risk population of medicare beneficiaries 
qmedcare  inc leverages considerable capabilities including the disease and care management services of the parent company  qmed  inc  in managing medical risk within a medicare population 
qmedcare  inc is the sole investor in qmedcare dakota  llc  a company specifically formed to administer a medicare advantage coordinated care special needs plan for dakotacare  a health maintenance organization in south dakota 
the special needs plan is marketed as heartline plus and provides exclusive health coverage for heart and stroke patients 
this plan is operated as a strategic alliance between qmedcare dakota  llc and dakotacare 
the goal of this alliance is to reduce disease complications  hospitalizations  and emergency room visits for members  and to improve their quality of life 
as part of its initiatives  qmedcare  inc established a captive insurance company in south carolina  lakeshore captive insurance company  to provide reinsurance for the special needs plan in south dakota 
through a retrocessional reinsurance agreement with ace american insurance company and its related agreements with dakotacare  effective january  through january   lakeshore captive insurance company assumes of the risk associated with the operations of the special needs plan in south dakota 
we reduce our exposure by insuring levels of coverage through reinsurance in excess of the first  of loss to a limit of  arising from claims by any one original insured 
we remain liable in the event the reinsurer is unable to pay their portion of the losses 
in an effort to minimize credit risk  we have reinsured our risk with an accredited reinsurance company having a strong financial rating am be a 
a ceding commission is paid by lakeshore captive insurance company at a ceding commission rate as determined by the agreement  approximately  which is recorded as an expense 
the agreement also has aggregate excess layers that function along with the related specific excess of loss layers 
upon termination of the agreement  the underlying policies in force at the time of the reinsurance coverage termination continue during the run off period until they expire 
subsequent to the dates of these financial statements  lakeshore captive insurance company arranged for a new agreement covering the term january  through january   with essentially similar terms 
additionally  the company executed a second snp contract with dakotacare for members who are dually eligible for both medicare and medicaid 
we anticipate the commencement of enrollment in april qmedcare of new jersey  inc was incorporated in january this organization is a licensed health maintenance organization in certain counties in new jersey established for the purpose of operating a medicare special needs plan designed specifically for medicare beneficiaries suffering from certain chronic conditions 
the company commenced enrollment in january positive directions  inc positive directions  inc is a wholly owned subsidiary of qmed  inc 
in may of  qmed  inc acquired positive directions  inc  formerly health e monitoring  inc  a privately owned firm offering a comprehensive program for healthy weight and lifestyle management 
in october  qmed  inc acquired all of the assets of disease management technologies  inc dmt 
dmt has developed a website for aa health and wellness program 
its program focuses on the role of wellness and prevention to establish healthy lifestyle habits  dietary and nutrition education  exercise regimens and behavioral modifications 
since the direction of this program will be primarily focused on our care coordination programs for our snp initiatives  we expect that minimalrevenue will be derived from third parties 
business strategy our strategy is to develop additional contracts with cms within the special needs plans snp provisions of the medicare modernization act  pursue additional company owned health maintenance organization licenses  pursue opportunities within the employer marketplace for our health and wellness  and weight management programs  pursue strategic alliances with other health plans within the special needs arena for patients suffering from chronic cardiovascular diseases  pursue contract opportunities with new health plans to provide disease management services  add disease states to our platform  and pursue other opportunities within the healthcare industry 
we anticipate that we will utilize our medical information communication technologies to gain and maintain competitive advantage in delivering care coordination and its narrower subset  disease management services 
we anticipate that significant investments will continue to be made during fiscal in the further development of our own hmo and related expansion opportunities  our operation of an snp in south dakota 
it is anticipated that some of these new capabilities and technologies may be added through strategic alliances with other entities 
marketing we market our disease management services to health plans  large physician practice groups  and governmental agencies through our sales staff 
a key to our success in marketing our services is the relationships we develop with providers  physicians and patients 
qmed builds the critical links among them that result in improved patient outcomes and reduced costs 
we have developed a comprehensive medicare strategy  and we project that a large portion of our future business will be in contracts with the federal and state governments 
in our current medicare projects  our relationships with physicians have given us a key advantage in identifying patients for the projects 
we will continue to promote these relationships  as they are critical to patient enrollment 
contracting efforts are conducted and coordinated by senior management personnel  with the aid  where appropriate  of certain independent consultants 
we generally pursue business opportunities through the traditional competitive process where a request for proposals rfp or a request for qualifications rfq is issued by a managed care  employer or government organization  to which a number of companies respond 
we utilize demographic and cost of service data from the organization as well as statistical information to conduct an initial cost analysis to determine program feasibility 
as part of our sales efforts  management meets with appropriate personnel from the organization making the request to best determine the organization s needs 
in the rfq process  the requesting agency selects a firm it believes is the most qualified to provide the requested services and then negotiates the terms of the contract with that firm  including the price at which its services are to be provided 
competition we believe ohms cvd offers a unique solution for cardiovascular disease management 
however  there are several entities  including pharmaceutical companies  pharmacy benefit managers and independent companies that are pursuing disease management  which we consider to be competition 
we believe we have competitive advantages because our clinical platform links the physician  patient and nurse to a coordinated plan of care therefore improving adherence to evidence based medicine and reducing gaps in care 
we have a specialty field management team dedicated to working directly with physicians and their office staff to promote the benefits of our disease management program 
the entire management system and its components are proprietary and patented 
we have documented improvements  for a health plan customer  in its hedis health plan employer data and information set audit  a competitive advantage for each customer  and the financial and clinical outcomes for our programs 
however  we cannot assure you that we can compete effectively with these other entities in the marketplace 
with the creation of the special needs plans program  we expect there will be significant competition from existing hmo s and there may be new entries into this field 
competition may increase and such competition could come from companies that are considerably larger and have greater financial and marketing resources 
consolidation has been  and may continue to be  an important factor in all aspects of the health care industry 
we cannot assure you that we can effectively compete with companies formed as a result of industry consolidation or that we can retain existing customers if they are acquired by other health plans which already have or are not interested in health and care support programs 
research and development in fiscal  and  we expended approximately   and  respectively  for research and development 
during these years  research and development was primarily focused on the development of patient care programs and advanced algorithms which coordinate care more rigorously and cost effectively  and systems which improve our patient out reach capabilities 
we plan to continue to enhance our existing systems and products to support the new initiatives within our managed care and health and wellness segments in anticipation of increasing revenues from these segments in fiscal patent protection and proprietary information we maintain a policy of seeking patent protection in the united states and other countries in connection with certain elements of our technology 
our monitor one technology has been granted patents in the united states patent no 
 canada patent no 
 and spain patent no 

we received a us patent for the ndx technology on march  patent no 
and a patent for the ohms cad system patent no 
 on march  certain patents relating to our technology began expiring in in october  qmed filed an application for a patent for certain elements of our technology related to the collection of medical information and its identification in relation to patient diagnoses 
the patent application is currently pending 
the patent laws of foreign countries may differ from those of the united states as to the patentability of our products and  accordingly the degree of protection afforded by the pendency or issuance of foreign patents may be different than the protection afforded under corresponding united states patents 
there can be no assurance that patents will be obtained in foreign jurisdictions with respect to our products or that the united states patents and any foreign patents will significantly protect or be commercially beneficial to us 
we do not intend to rely solely on patent protection for our proprietary technology 
we also rely upon trade secrets  copyright protection  confidentiality agreements with employees  know how  expertise  and lead time to attain and maintain our competitive position 
to the extent that we rely upon these measures  there can be no assurance that others might not independently develop similar technology or that secrecy will not be breached 
privacy issues because our applications and services are utilized to transmit and manage highly sensitive and confidential health information  the security and confidentiality concerns of our customers and their patients are a primary concern 
in order to enable our applications and services to transmit sensitive and confidential medical information  we utilize advanced technologies designed to ensure a high degree of security 
these technologies generally include security that requires a password to access our systems  user access restrictions that allow our customers to determine the individuals who will have access to data and what level of access each individual will have  encryption of data relating to our applications and services  and a mechanism for preventing outsiders from improperly accessing private data resources on our internal network and our applications commonly referred to as a firewall 
our customers also implement their own procedures to protect the confidentiality of information being transferred into and out of their computer network 
despite these efforts  it is not possible to assure data security 
internally  we work to ensure the safe handling of confidential data by employees by using individual user names and passwords for each employee handling electronic data  and requiring each employee to sign an agreement to comply with all company policies including our policy regarding handling confidential information 
we monitor proposed regulations that might affect our applications and services  in order to ensure that we are in compliance with such regulations when and if they are affected 
government regulation healthcare regulation 
as a participant in the healthcare industry  our operations and relationships are subject to regulation by federal and state laws and regulations and enforcement by federal and state governmental agencies 
sanctions may be imposed for violation of these laws 
we believe our operations are in substantial compliance with existing laws that are material to our operations 
the cost of complying with our contractual privacy obligations has not  to date  had a material negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
in  health plans  most health care providers and certain other entities were required to comply with federal security regulations issued pursuant to hipaa  which require the use of administrative  physician  and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality  integrity and availability of electronic individually identifiable health information 
fda regulation 
the food and drug administration  or fda  generally has the authority to regulate medical devices including computer applications when devices are indicated  labeled or intended to be used in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions  or in the cure  mitigation  treatment or prevention of disease  or are intended to affect the structure or function of the body 
we do not believe that any of our current services are subject to fda regulation as medical devices  however  expansion of our application and service offerings could subject us to fda regulation 
our products  to the extent they may be deemed medical devices  are regulated by the fda under the federal food  drug and cosmetics act the fdca and related regulations 
all medical devices sold in interstate commerce are subject to fda clearance 
our monitors are subject to pre market notification k  pursuant to which the fda determines whether a new medical product is substantially equivalent to a product that was on the market prior to may  products found to be substantially equivalent to those products may thereafter be sold 
the fda has the authority  which it has not yet exercised  to issue performance standards for the type of monitors manufactured by us 
regulations by the fda  known as good manufacturing practices gmp  provide standards for manufacturing processes  facilities  and record keeping requirements with which our contract manufacturers and we must also comply 
we believe that the manufacturing and quality control procedures employed by us and our contract manufacturers meet the gmp requirements 
if the fda should determine that our monitors were not manufactured in accordance with gmp s  it has the authority to order us to cease production and could require us to recall products already sold by us 
in addition  any facilities used to manufacture or assemble our products will be subject to inspection by the fda at least biannually 
the fdca is not the exclusive source of regulation of medical devices and  by its terms  allows state and local authorities to adopt more stringent regulations for medical devices 
regulation of the internet 
laws and regulations applicable to communications or commerce over the internet may be adopted covering user privacy  pricing  content  copyright  distribution  and characteristics and quality of products and services 
in addition  some states or foreign countries could apply existing laws concerning issues such as property ownership  sales tax  libel  and personal privacy to transactions conducted over the internet 
additional laws or regulations or application of laws to transactions over the internet could require us to change our operations and or increase our cost of doing business 
to our knowledge and other than what we have described in this report and other than occupational health and safety laws and labor laws which are generally applicable to most companies  our products are not subject to governmental regulation by any federal  state or local agencies that would affect the manufacture  sale or use of our products 
we cannot  of course  predict what sort of regulations of this type may be imposed in the future  but we do not anticipate any unusual difficulties in complying with governmental regulations that may be adopted in the future 
insurance we maintain managed care errors and omissions  product liability  directors and officers  reinsurance  and general liability insurance for our locations and operations 
while we believe our insurance policies to be adequate in amount and coverage for our current operations  there can be no assurance that coverage is sufficient to cover all future claims 
in recent years  the cost of liability and other forms of insurance have increased significantly 
there is no assurance that such insurance will continue to be available in adequate amounts or at reasonable costs 
our liability insurance coverage provides for certain deductible levels to be paid by us 
we also maintain property and workers compensation insurance for each of our locations with commercial carriers on relatively standard commercial terms and conditions 
employees we had employees as of november   none of which are subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
we believe our relations with employees are good

critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies are described in note of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended november  the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments involved in preparing the financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
revenue recognition we enter into contractual arrangements with health plans and government agencies to provide disease management services 
fees under our health plan contracts are generally determined by multiplying a contractually negotiated rate per health plan member per month pmpm by the number of health plan members covered by our services during the month 
the pmpm rates usually differ between contracts due to the various types of health plan product groups eg ppo  hmo  medicare advantage 
these contracts are generally for terms of one to three years with provisions for subsequent renewal  and typically provide that all or a portion of our fees may be performance based 
performance based contracts have varying degrees of risk associated with our ability to deliver the guaranteed financial cost savings 
in most cases  we guarantee a percentage reduction of disease costs compared to a prior baseline year determined by actuarial analysis and other estimates used as a basis to measure performance objectives 
the measurement of our performance against the base year information is a data intensive and time consuming process that is typically not completed until six to eight months after the end of the contract year 
we bill our customers each month for the entire amount of the fees contractually due based on previous months membership  which always includes the amount  if any  that may be subject to refund for retroactive member terminations and a shortfall in performance 
we adjust or defer revenue for contracts where we believe performance is short of contractual obligations  possibly resulting in a refund of fees or where fees generated may be subject to further retroactive adjustment associated with a contract or plan s decision to completely terminate its coverage in a geographic market as well as general membership changes 
for example  general terminations can be due to a member s death  member change of health plan  etc 
we recognize revenue  in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletins no 
and no 
 as follows we recognize the fixed portion of our monthly fee as revenue during the period we perform the services  we recognize the performance based portion of the monthly fees based on indicators of performance to date in the contract year  and we recognize previously recorded deferred revenue upon final settlement of the contract measurement year 
adjustments for shortfalls in performance targets under the terms of the contracts or other factors affecting revenue recognition are accrued on an estimated basis in the period the services are provided and are adjusted in future periods when final settlement is determined 
we assess our estimates by analyzing various information including but not limited to  medical claims data  prior performance under the contract and review of physician and patient participation levels 
we review these estimates periodically and make adjustments  as interim information is available 
we determine our level of performance at interim periods based on medical claims data  achievement of physician and patient participation levels  or other data supplied by the health plan 
in the event these interim performance measures indicate that performance targets are not being met or sufficient data is unavailable  fees  which could be subject to refund  are not recorded as revenue but rather are recorded as a current liability entitled contract billings in excess of revenues 
under performance based arrangements  the ability to make estimates at interim periods can be challenging due to the inherent nature of the medical claims process and the lag time associated with it 
in most cases  complete paid claims data is not available until up to six months after claims are incurred 
although interim data measurements are indicative of performance objectives  actual results could differ from our estimates 
the settlement process under a contract  which includes the settlement of any performance based fees and involves reconciliation of health care claims and clinical data  is generally not completed until after the end of the contract year 
data reconciliation differences between the company and the customer can arise due to health plan data deficiencies  omissions and or data discrepancies  for which the company negotiates with the customer until agreement is reached with respect to identified issues 
during the fiscal year ended november   approximately of disease management services were derived from two health plans that each comprised more than of the company s revenues 
during the fiscal year ended november   approximately of disease management services were derived from three health plans that each comprised more than of the company s revenues 
during the fiscal year ended november   approximately of disease management services were derived from four health plans that each comprised more than of the company s revenues 
the company continues to anticipate a concentration of revenues from a limited number of customers in fiscal year in  the pacificare contract and bipa medicare demonstration project were terminated resulting in a reduction in revenue of approximately million 
in a letter dated october   the company was notified by healthsuite partners  a joint venture with alere medical  airlogix and the company  that the healthsuite partners contract with healthpartners  a minnesota managed care organization  would not be extended beyond april  this notice of nonrenewal will result in a reduction in revenue of approximately million in managed care services the company s captive insurance company entered into an agreement with a reinsurer whereby the captive insurance company assumes of the risk associated with the operations of a special needs plan snp in south dakota 
the snp offers comprehensive health care coverage and prescription drug benefits for chronically ill medicare recipients 
the company receives a fixed monthly member premium and a medicare risk adjusted premium  which is based upon the diagnoses of the enrolled member as billed by the physician 
the cost of health care provided is accrued in the period it is dispensed to the enrolled members  based in part on estimates for services and other health care costs that have been incurred but not yet reported ibnr  classified as medical claims reserve on the condensed consolidated balance sheet 
since this is a new plan  the company estimates its ibnr based upon an independent actuarial analysis of expected costs 
as the plan matures  the company will develop these estimates using standard actuarial methods which may include  among other factors  the average interval between the dates services are rendered and the date claims are paid  denied claims activity  disputed claims activity  expected health care cost inflation  utilization  seasonality patterns and changes in membership 
the company records its best estimate of the liability for incurred claims  however  such estimates could materially understate or overstate our actual liability for medical and benefits payable 
the estimates for submitted claims and ibnr claims liabilities are made on an accrual basis and adjusted in future periods as required 
adjustments to prior period estimates or financial results  if any  are included in current operations 
the company records revenue from health care premiums received in the month that enrollees are entitled to coverage 
the company also entered into an agreement with dakotacare  a health maintenance organization  to administer the snp in south dakota 
in accordance with the agreement  the company records revenue on a monthly basis as services are rendered 
impairment of intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company is required to review intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the company amortizes other identifiable intangible assets  such as acquired technologies  customer contracts  and other intangibles  on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  except for trade names  which have an indefinite life and are not subject to amortization 
the company reviews intangible assets not subject to amortization on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
the company also assesses the potential impairment of intangible assets subject to amortization whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable 
if the company determines that the carrying value of other identifiable intangible assets may not be recoverable  the company calculates any impairment using an estimate of the asset s fair value based on the projected net cash flows expected to result from that asset  including eventual disposition 
during the year ended november   the company recorded an impairment charge of approximately  related to a write down of the assembled workforce 
future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that acquired intangible assets are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
share based compensation on december   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires the company to measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards based on estimated fair values at the date of grant 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions  which involve a number of variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and expected stock option exercise behavior 
in addition  it requires judgment in estimating the number of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
the company contracts with a third party to assist in developing the assumptions used in estimating the fair values of stock options

r share based payments  and iv an increase of approximately  related to the medical claims associated with the south dakota snp program since the commencement of operations on january  the decrease in gross profit margins was offset by a decrease of approximately  of labor costs associated with the reduction in workforce and operating costs related to the non renewal of contracts 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year increased by approximately million over fiscal year the increase was attributable to i an increase of approximately  in salaries related to new executives and additional new hires for the operations of qmedcare  inc  qmedcare of new jersey  inc  and positive directions  inc

included within selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year which incorporates the expenses noted above was approximately  of costs incurred related to the managed care segment  of which  was related to the implementation costs of the snp project in new jersey and the remaining costs related to the implementation and operation of the snp in south dakota 
additionally  approximately  of costs recorded during fiscal year of which  was included within selling  general and administrative expenses were incurred as implementation costs of positive directions  inc research and development expenses for fiscal year increased approximately  or over fiscal year our accounting policy is to capitalize certain software development costs during development and amortize them upon implementation 
subsequent to implementation any further costs ie maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
the increase in expenses is primarily attributable to i an increase of approximately  in salaries and related costs associated with new hires  and ii approximately  in compensation costs associated with the adoption of sfas no 
r share based payments 
the increase in expenses was offset by i a decrease of approximately  in consulting costs 
during fiscal year  there was an increase of approximately  in capitalization of costs  which include salaries and consultant fees  incurred for development as compared to fiscal year we continue to focus our efforts on the development of new  advanced software programs to assist in the identification and evaluation of patients who are at risk for developing various disease conditions 
these programs incorporate state of the art telecommunications  data management  and security and information technology 
certain costs associated with the development of new product software to be incorporated into our disease management and snp programs are capitalized and amortized over a two to five year useful life 
we intend to continue to improve and expand the capabilities of all of our technologies 
interest income for fiscal year was approximately  as compared to  for fiscal year this increase is attributable to the investment of the funds that were generated by the private placements in the first six months of fiscal year along with the cash generated from operations in fiscal loss on operations of joint ventures for fiscal year decreased approximately  as compared to fiscal year the decrease is primarily attributable to reduction in costs incurred associated with the settlement with the regence group and centre insurance in fiscal and the dissolution of the respective joint venture in december the decrease in costs was offset by costs related to a joint venture entered into with two partners to provide services under a disease management contract in minnesota 
other income for fiscal year increased approximately  as compared to fiscal year the increase was attributable to the sale of a patent for  to a third party in may our effective tax rate for fiscal year is 
the difference in the company s effective tax rate from the federal statutory rate is primarily due to a valuation allowance provided for all deferred tax assets and the adoption of sfas no 
r share based payments 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenue for fiscal year increased approximately million or over fiscal year this increase is attributable to i an increase of approximately million of revenue related to the increase in enrollment related to contracts entered into during fiscal year  ii the recognition of approximately million of previously deferred revenue and bonuses earned under contracts with healthpartners  summacare and pacificare where performance measurements were achieved or surpassed  iii an increase in revenue of  representing a return of funds previously paid under the guarantee in connection with the settlement of its arbitration with the regence group and centre insurance  iv a reduction of revenue in fiscal year of approximately  representing an increase in management s deferred revenue estimate in connection with its settlement with the regence group  and v a reduction of  in revenue during fiscal year as a result of the reconciliation process for one of our smaller health plans 
these increases were offset by a reduction in revenue of approximately million from the termination of one disease management program  market exits and reductions in membership under existing disease management programs 
gross profit margins for fiscal year increased to from for fiscal year this increase is related to i an increase in revenue attributable to an increase in enrollment in contracts entered into in fiscal year while direct costs associated with the initial implementation costs on these contracts were incurred in fiscal year  the incremental costs associated with the increased enrollment in fiscal year were not as significant as the initial implementation costs incurred in fiscal year  ii an increase in revenue in fiscal year of  without a corresponding increase in costs  representing a return of funds previously paid under the guarantee in connection with the settlement of its arbitration with the regence group and centre insurance  iii a decrease in revenue in fiscal year of approximately  without a corresponding decrease in costs  which represented an increase in management s deferred revenue estimate in connection with its settlement with the regence group  iv the recognition of approximately million of revenue  without a corresponding increase in costs  related to the recognition of previously deferred revenue and bonuses earned under contracts with healthpartners  summacare and pacificare where performance measurements were achieved or surpassed  and v approximately million in labor and related cost reductions associated with efficiencies related to enhancements in our programs 
the increase in gross profit margins was offset by an increase of approximately  related to the outsourcing of certain call center services and  in equipment costs for our disease management programs 
we expect a significant reduction in gross profits in fiscal year as a result of the reduction in revenue related to the termination of contracts and the increase in costs of sales as a result of the share based payments required to be expensed under sfas no 
r  shared based payment 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year increased by approximately million or over fiscal year the increase was attributable to i an increase of approximately  in salaries and related expenses primarily related to two new executives for qmedcare  inc and positive directions  inc 
and additional new hires throughout the company  ii an increase of approximately  in travel expenses primarily related to business development for qmedcare  inc and positive directions  inc 
ii a  increase in consulting services  iii a  increase in advertising in connection with our snp project in south dakota  iv a  increase in costs associated with trade shows during fiscal year  v a  increase in depreciation and amortization primarily attributable to the intangibles associated with the acquisition of positive directions  inc in the second quarter of fiscal year and disease management technologies  inc in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and an increase in amortization of product software development  and vi a  increase in accounting and legal fees for compliance services 
these increases were offset by a decrease of approximately  in commissions related to new contracts with health plans entered into in fiscal year and a decrease in insurance costs of  included within selling  general and administrative expenses outlined above was approximately million of costs incurred as implementation costs of qmedcare inc relating to the snp project in south dakota and approximately  of costs were incurred as implementation costs of positive directions  inc we expect to continue to incur implementation costs for both qmed care inc and positive directions  inc 
in fiscal year and anticipate these costs to increase during this time period 
research and development expenses for fiscal year increased approximately  or over fiscal year our accounting policies are to capitalize certain software development costs during development and amortize them upon implementation 
subsequent to implementation any further costs ie maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we completed the primary development of one of our new systems and therefore all subsequent costs are being expensed  which accounts for a portion of the increase in research and development expense 
in addition  we incurred expenses in connection with the development of the positive directions  inc web based wellness program 
we continue to focus our efforts on the development of new advanced software programs  web based applications  and tools to assist in the identification and evaluation of patients who are at risk for developing various disease conditions 
these programs incorporate state of the art telecommunications  data management  and security and information technology 
certain costs associated with the development of new product software to be incorporated into our disease management programs are capitalized and amortized over a year useful life 
we intend to continue to improve and expand the capabilities of all of our technologies 
interest income for fiscal year was approximately  as compared to approximately  for fiscal year this increase is attributable to the investment of the funds that were primarily generated by the private placements in the first six months of fiscal year along with the cash generated from operations throughout fiscal year loss on operations of joint ventures for fiscal year increased approximately  over fiscal year the expense for fiscal year primarily represents legal fees for the arbitration and settlement with the regence group and centre insurance  and costs related to a joint venture entered into with two partners to provide services under a disease management contract in minnesota 
our effective tax rate for fiscal year is 
the difference in the company s effective tax rate from the federal statutory rate is primarily due to a valuation allowance provided for all deferred tax assets and the sale of certain state tax benefits 
current period income tax expense represents federal and state tax liabilities attributable to the reported net income 
liquidity and capital resources to date  our principal sources of working capital have been the proceeds from public and private placements of securities 
since our inception  sales of securities  including the proceeds from the exercise of outstanding options and warrants  have generated approximately  less applicable expenses 
we had working capital of approximately million at november  compared to approximately million at november  and ratios of current assets to current liabilities of as of november  and as of november  the working capital decrease of approximately million was primarily due to the net loss of approximately million resulting in cash used in operations of approximately million along with capital expenditures of million 
in september  we entered into a  line of credit agreement with wachovia bank  national association 
the agreement is collateralized by securities owned by the company and was to expire on september  the line had been extended for days and management decided not to renew the line of credit and requested a release of the collateral 
outstanding balances under the loan bear interest at an annual rate equal to the lower of the bank s reference rate minus or libor plus 
as of november   no funds had been drawn 
in december  the company established a  letter of credit with wachovia bank  na to establish the capital required by regulation for the company s captive insurance company in south carolina 
on may  the company received approval of their application to obtain a license to operate as a health maintenance organization within the state of new jersey from the department of banking and insurance 
in accordance with statutory requirements  the company was required to establish a statutory reserve and must maintain a minimum net worth requirement 
accordingly  the company deposited funds deposited approximately  in the statutory reserve account and made a capital contribution of million to qmedcare of new jersey in june in december  the company funded an additional million representing an insolvency reserve established for qmedcare of new jersey  inc as required by the state of new jersey department of banking and insurance 
these funds will be classified as noncurrent assets as the cash is not available for current operations 
the funds are held in trust currently invested in certificates of deposit 
as the company s premiums increase from growth in membership  it is anticipated that the company will incur additional statutory requirements 
in fiscal year  we anticipate that we will expend cash to fund our current operations  fund our continuing implementation costs associated with our managed care and wellness segments  and for establishing and maintaining certain levels of capital reserves as required by regulatory agencies in connection with the operations of our insurance subsidiary 
although we expect to incur these expenditures  we believe that our cash and investments  and availability under our credit line will be sufficient to fund our current level of growth and our existing and anticipated commitments 
however  to the extent the expansion of our operations requires significant additional resources or certain other forms of financial guarantees  we may be required to seek additional financing 
no assurance can be given that such financing would be available on terms that would be acceptable to us 
material commitments the following schedule summarizes our contractual cost obligations as of november  in the periods indicated 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt capital lease obligations    operating leases    unconditional purchase obligations   other long term obligations employment agreements    total contractual cash obligations   risk factors you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this md a or elsewhere in the form k 
these risks and other factors may affect forward looking statements including those in this md a or made by the company elsewhere  such as in investor calls or conference presentations 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business 
if any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into an actual event  this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could decline materially 
future operating results 
future operating results  which reflect management s current expectations may be impacted by a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated herein 
these factors include worldwide economic and political conditions  terrorist activities  industry specific factors  and regulatory change 
new business segment special needs plans we have commenced operations of our new business segment as the administrator for a medicare advantage coordinated care special needs plan for dakotacare  a large health maintenance organization in south dakota 
we will commence with operations of our new jersey special needs plan in january the special needs plans will be marketed as heartline plus in south dakota and qmedcare in new jersey and will provide exclusive health coverage for heart and stroke patients 
our company will be faced with all of the risks of establishing a new business  including significant start up costs  uncertainty as to the timing and number of enrollees in the plan  effectively managing health care costs  and ability to achieve and maintain profitable operations 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause volatility in the price of our common stock 
given the nature of the markets in which we participate  we cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability 
our quarterly revenue and operating results depend upon a number of factors including  but not limited to  the timing of contracts signed  enrollment of plan members and progress of programs implemented during the quarter  which are difficult to forecast 
in addition  a portion of our operating expenses is fixed in nature due to our revenue  research and development costs  to the extent that projected revenue does not meet forecast  these fixed cost would impact operating results 
we are in the process of implementing new information systems  problems with the redesign and implementation of these new systems could interfere with our operations 
we are in the process of implementing new information systems to enhance our current infrastructure in order to improve operating efficiency and expand the range of the care management services we offer 
we may not be successful in implementing these new systems and transitioning data 
as part of this effort  we are implementing software applications to manage our business operations 
failure to smoothly and successfully convert to this and or other systems could temporarily interrupt our operations and adversely impact our ability to run the business 
in addition  any failure or significant downtime in our new information systems could prevent us from efficiently implementing care management programs  reconciling cost savings timely and accurately  and could harm our business 
our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel 
our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research  engineering  sales  marketing  insurance  executive  and administrative personnel 
if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel  we will not be able to maintain or expand our business 
acquisitions  strategic alliances  and joint ventures may result in financial results that are different than expected 
we engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions  strategic alliances  and joint ventures 
as a result of such transactions  our financial results may differ from the investment community s expectations in a given quarter 
in addition  acquisitions and strategic alliances may require us to integrate a different company culture  management team  and business infrastructure 
we may have difficulty developing  manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines to realize the value from expected synergies 
depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition  our successful integration of the entity would depend on a variety of factors  including the retention of key employees  the management of facilities and employees in separate geographic areas  the retention of key customers  and the integration or coordination of different research and development  product manufacturing  and sales programs and facilities all of these efforts require varying levels of management resources  which may divert our attention from other business operations 
if we do not realize the expected benefits from such transactions  our financial position results and stock price could be negatively impacted 
we and our customers are subject to various governmental regulations  compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses  and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations  we may be forced to curtail operations  and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 
our businesses are subject to various significant federal  state  and local health and safety  health information disclosure  and labor regulations 
these regulations are complex  change frequently  and have tended to become more stringent over time 
we may be required to incur significant expenses in order to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations 
any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our operations  or portions of our operations  or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations 
litigation regarding patents or intellectual property could be costly and time consuming 
any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations 
the complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks 
claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements 
however  we may not be able to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain of our products 
third parties may infringe our intellectual property  and we may expend significant resources enforcing our rights or suffer competitive injury 
our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets  confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights  our competitive position could suffer  which could harm our operating results 
our pending patent and trademark registration applications may not be allowed  or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of these patents or trademark registrations 
in addition  our patents may not provide us a meaningful competitive advantage 
we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights 
we may not be able to detect infringement and our competitive position may be harmed 
in addition  competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies 
intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries  which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share 
we depend on payments from cms and health plans  and cost reductions within those entities may adversely affect our business and results of operations 
the healthcare industry in which we operate is currently subject to significant cost reduction pressures as a result of constrained revenues from governmental and private sources as well as from the increasing underlying cost of medical care 
we believe that these pressures will continue and possibly intensify 
while we believe that our services are geared specifically to assist health plans and governmental agencies in controlling the high costs associated with the treatment of chronic diseases  the pressures to reduce costs immediately may have a negative effect  in certain circumstances  on the ability of or the length of time required for us to sign new contracts 
in addition  this focus on cost reduction may result in increased focus from health plans on contract restructurings that reduce the fees paid to us for our services 
there can be no assurance that these financial pressures will not have a negative impact on our operations 
compliance with new federal and state legislation and regulation could adversely affect our results of operations or may require us to invest substantial amounts acquiring and implementing new information systems and or modifying existing systems 
health plans and employers are subject to considerable state and federal government regulation 
many of these regulations are vaguely written and subject to differing interpretations that may  in certain cases  result in unintended consequences that may impact our ability to effectively deliver our services 
the focus on regulatory and legislative efforts to protect the confidentiality of patient identifiable medical information  as evidenced by the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa  is one such example 
we believe that our ability to obtain from health plans and cms patient identifiable medical information for disease management purposes is protected in federal regulations governing medical record confidentiality 
state legislation or regulation of this information may be more restrictive 
we are continually determining the extent to which specific state legislation or regulations govern our health plan operations 
new federal or state legislation or regulation in this area  which prohibitively restricts the availability of certain critical information to us  would have a material negative impact on our operations 
the disease management industry experiences a lengthy sales cycle for new contracts 
the disease management industry has many entrants marketing various services and products labeled as disease management 
the generic label of disease management has been utilized to characterize a wide range of activities from the sale of medical supplies and drugs to services aimed at disease management 
as a result  health plan purchasers of these services have had a challenging experience purchasing  evaluating  or monitoring such services  this generally results in a lengthy sales cycle for new health plan contracts 
in addition  with the reduction in revenue of million resulting from the termination of the pacificare contract and bipa medicare demonstration project  we continue to anticipate a concentration of revenues in fiscal resulting from a limited number of customers 
until we sign and implement additional health plan contracts  the loss or a downward restructuring of a contract would negatively and materially impact our results of operations and financial condition 
the disease management industry depends on effectively using information systems and the failure of these systems could adversely affect our business 
the disease management industry is dependent on the effective use of information technology 
while we believe that our state of the art technology provides us with a competitive advantage in the industry  we expect to continually invest in updating and expanding this technology 
in addition  these system requirements expose us to technology obsolescence risks 
accordingly  we amortize our computer software and hardware over three to five years 
we depend on the timely receipt of accurate data from our health plan customers and our accurate analysis of this data 
the measurement of our performance under our health plan contracts is highly dependent upon the timely receipt of accurate data from our health plan customers and the accuracy of the analysis of such data 
data acquisition  data quality control  and data analysis are intense and complex processes subject to error 
untimely  incomplete or inaccurate data from a customer or flawed analysis of such data could have a material adverse impact on our revenues from that contract 
our revenue is subject to seasonal pressure resulting from the disenrollment process of our health plan clients 
the membership enrollment and disenrollment processes of our health plan customers can result in a cyclical reduction of lives under management  especially during our first quarter 
employers typically make decisions about health insurance carriers at the end of each calendar year 
health plans also periodically assess the types of markets they service as well as the contractual arrangements of medical groups within those markets 
in any event  all of these factors will have an effect on membership as of january of each year 
a health plan s decision to exit markets or non renewal of contracts with its medical groups will result in a loss of covered lives under management as of january although these decisions may also result in a gain of members  the process of identification and enrollment will typically lag by six months or longer 
the result of these cyclical changes has not  to date  had a material impact on the company s revenues or results of operations but could have such an effect in the future 
a potential seasonal impact on covered membership could be caused by a decision by a health plan to withdraw or expand coverage thereby automatically disenrolling previously covered members or enrolling new members  and or would significant shifts in employer s participation in the plans 
contract renewals no assurances can be given that results from contract restructurings and possible terminations at or prior to renewal would not have a material negative impact on our operations and financial condition 
share prices of healthcare companies and our share price in particular may be volatile 
the volatility may be influenced by the market s perceptions of the healthcare sector in general  or of other companies believed to be similar to us or by the market s perception of our operations and future prospects 
many of these perceptions are beyond our control 
health care regulation general the federal and state governments have adopted laws and regulations that govern our business activities in various ways 
these laws and regulations restrict how we conduct our business and result in additional burdens and costs to us 
areas of governmental regulation include licensure policy forms  including plan design and disclosures premium rates and rating methodologies underwriting rules and procedures benefit mandates eligibility requirements service areas market conduct utilization review activities payment of claims  including timeliness and accuracy of payment member rights and responsibilities sales and marketing activities quality assurance procedures disclosure of medical and other information provider rates of payment surcharges on provider payments provider contract forms delegation of risk and other financial arrangements producer licensing and compensation financial condition including reserves and corporate governance these laws and regulations are different in each jurisdiction 
states generally require health insurers and hmos to obtain a certificate of authority prior to commencing operations 
to establish a new insurance company or an hmo in a state  we generally would have to obtain such a certificate 
the time necessary to obtain such a certificate varies from state to state 
each health insurer and hmo must file periodic financial and operating reports with the states in which it does business 
in addition  health insurers and hmos are subject to state examination and periodic license renewal 
legislative and regulatory initiatives there has been a continuing trend of increased health care regulation at both the federal and state levels 
the federal government and many states have enacted or are considering additional legislation or regulation related to health care plans 
legislation  regulation  and initiatives relating to this trend include among other things  the following amending or supplementing erisa to impose greater requirements on the administration of employer funded benefit plans or limit to the scope of current erisa pre emption  which would among other things expose health plans to expanded liability for punitive and other extra contractual damages 
imposing assessments on or to be collected by health plans or health carriers  such as assessments for insolvency  assessments for uninsured or high risk pools  assessments for uncompensated care  or assessments to defray provider medical malpractice insurance costs 
extending malpractice and other liability exposure for decisions made by health plans 
mandating coverage for certain conditions and or specified procedures  drugs  or devices eg infertility treatment  experimental pharmaceuticals 
mandating direct access to specialists for patients with chronic conditions  and direct access to ob gyns  chiropractors  or other practitioners 
mandating expanded employer and consumer disclosures and notices 
mandating expanded coverage for emergency services 
prohibiting or limiting certain types of financial arrangements with providers including  among other things  incentives based on utilization of services or various other performance metrics 
imposing substantial penalties for failure to pay claims within specified time periods 
regulating the composition of provider networks  as occurs with willing provider and pharmacy laws which generally provide that providers and pharmacies cannot be denied participation in a managed care plan where the providers and pharmacies are willing to abide by the terms and conditions of that plan 
imposing a fee schedule for out of network care 
exempting physicians from the antitrust laws that prohibit price fixing  group boycotts  and other horizontal restraints on competition 
restricting health plan claim and related procedures 
requiring the application of treatment and financial parity between mental health benefits and medical benefits within the same health plan 
extending benefits available to workers who lose their jobs and others who are uninsured 
mandating liberalized definitions of medical necessity 
mandating internal and external grievance and appeal procedures including expedited decision making and access to external claim review 
enabling the creation of new types of health plans or health carriers  which in some instances would not be subject to the regulations or restrictions that govern our operations 
allowing individuals and small groups to collectively purchase health care coverage without any other affiliations 
imposing requirements and restrictions on operations of pharmacy benefit managers  including restricting or eliminating the use of formularies for prescription drugs 
making health plans responsible for provider payments in the event of financial failure by a capitated physician group or other intermediary 
creating or expanding state sponsored health benefit purchasing pools  in which we might be required to participate 
creating a single payer system where the government oversees or manages the provision of health care coverage 
imposing employer or individual health coverage mandates 
it is uncertain whether we can counter the potential adverse effects of such potential legislation or regulation  including whether we can recoup  through higher premiums or other measures  the increased costs of mandated benefits or other increased costs due to regulatory change 
we also may be adversely impacted by court and regulatory decisions that expand the interpretations of existing statutes and regulations or impose medical malpractice or bad faith liability 
among other issues  the courts  including the us supreme court and federal and state courts  continue to consider cases addressing the pre emptive effect of erisa on state laws 
in general  limitations to this pre emption have the effect of increasing our costs  liability exposures  or both 
legislative initiatives discussed above include proposals in the us congress to restrict the pre emptive effect of erisa and legislative activity in several states that  should it result in enacted legislation that is not preempted by erisa  could increase our liability exposure and could result in greater state regulation of our operations 
patients rights legislation various state legislatures and the us congress continue to debate legislation containing various patient protection initiatives  including provisions that could expose the company to unlimited economic damages and certain punitive damages  for making a determination denying benefits or for delaying members receipt of benefits as a result of medical necessity or other coverage determinations 
the company cannot predict whether these measures will be enacted into law in or what form any such legislation might take 
erisa the provision of services to certain employee benefit plans including certain health care  group insurance and large case pensions benefit plans  is subject to erisa  a complex set of laws and regulations subject to interpretation and enforcement by the internal revenue service and the department of labor the dol 
erisa regulates certain aspects of the relationships between us and employers who maintain employee benefit plans subject to erisa 
some of our administrative services and other activities may also be subject to regulation under erisa 
in addition  some states require licensure or registration of companies providing third party claims administration services for benefit plans 
dol regulations under erisa set standards for claim payment and member appeals along with associated notice and disclosure requirements 
we have invested significant time and attention to compliance with these new standards  which represent an additional regulatory burden for us 
we face a wide range of risks  and our success depends on our ability to identify  prioritize and appropriately manage our enterprise risk exposures 
operating in a complex industry  we expect to encounter a variety of risks 
the risks we face include  among other matters  the range of industry  competitive  regulatory  operational or external risks identified in this risk factor discussion 
failure to appropriately identify  manage and or mitigate these risks can affect our profitability  our ability to retain or grow business  or  in the event of extreme circumstances  our financial condition or viability 
our ability to forecast and manage health care costs affects profitability 
in the special needs plan business segment  profitability depends in large part on accurately forecasting health care costs and on our ability to appropriately manage future health care costs through underwriting criteria  product design  negotiation of favorable provider contracts and medical management programs 
the aging of the population and other demographic characteristics  and advances in medical technology and other factors continue to contribute to rising health care costs 
government imposed limitations on medicare and medicaid reimbursement have also caused the private sector to bear a greater share of increasing health care costs 
changes in health care practices  inflation  new technologies  the cost of prescription drugs and direct to consumer marketing by pharmaceutical companies  adverse selection  changes in the regulatory environment  health care provider or member fraud and numerous other factors affecting the cost of health care are beyond any health plan s control and may adversely affect our ability to predict and manage health care costs  as well as our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the profitability of our business will depend on our ability to effectively manage health care costs for our chronically ill members 
the number of individual services rendered and the cost of each service affect total health care costs 
although we believe our disease management expertise will allow us to control costs effectively  inflation  regulations and other factors may cause actual costs to exceed estimates 
these factors include  but are not limited to  increased use of services  increased cost of individual services  catastrophes  epidemics  the introduction of new or costly treatments  technology  new mandate benefits or other regulatory changes  insured population characteristics and seasonal changes in the level of health care use 
in addition  since we are just entering this managed care segment and are likely to have a low enrollment base in the early stages  we are potentially at financial risk from individuals who may incur abnormally high medical costs 
since a large portion of the premiums are utilized for medical costs  relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs can result in significant changes in our financial results 
there can be no assurance regarding the accuracy of medical cost projections assumed for pricing purposes and if the rate of increase in medical costs in were to exceed the levels of medicare reimbursement  our results would be materially adversely affected 
we expect that management will need to focus simultaneously on multiple strategic and operational initiatives as we seek to further improve our financial performance  profitably grow our business  and differentiate our products and services  if we do not successfully implement these initiatives  or if these initiatives do not achieve their objectives  our results could be materially adversely affected 
management will need to continue to focus on executing multiple strategic and operational projects and initiatives at the same time  including  among other things  new customer market approach  further improving the efficiency of operations  certain significant technology projects  further improving relations with health care providers  customer or provider contracting changes  or other business process improvements 
the future performance of our business will depend in large part on our ability to design and implement these initiatives 
if these initiatives do not achieve their objectives or result in increased medical costs  our results could be adversely affected 
refer to overview for more information 
we would be adversely affected if there were a significant loss or significant shift in the type of our managed care insurance initiatives 
failure to achieve profitable membership growth in our managed care insurance initiatives could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
terrorism or the continued threat of terrorism  epidemics or other extreme events could materially increase health care utilization and pharmacy costs and group insurance life and disability claims  although we cannot predict whether any such increases will occur 
terrorism can affect the us economy in general  but also the healthcare industry and qmed specifically 
beyond obtaining coverage for our facilities  there are few  if any  commercial options through which to transfer the exposure from terrorism away from the company 
in particular  in the event of bioterrorism epidemics or other extreme events  we could face significant health care costs depending on the government s actions and the responsiveness of public health agencies and insurers 
success of our business depends in part on effective information technology systems and on continuing to develop and implement improvements in technology  certain significant multiyear strategic information technology projects are currently in process 
we need to continue to improve our systems to meet current standards and keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology  evolving industry and regulatory standards  and customer demands 
our success is dependent in large part on maintaining the effectiveness of existing systems  on implementing improvements  and on continuing to develop and enhance information systems that support our business processes in a cost efficient manner 
in the future  we expect to hold reserves for expected claims  which are estimated 
these estimates are highly judgmental  if actual claims exceed reserve estimates our results could be materially adversely affected 
reserves will be established to reflect estimates of the ultimate cost of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported or reported but not yet paid 
these reserves will be estimated periodically  and any resulting adjustments will be reflected in current period operating results 
these reserves will be based on a number of factors  including those derived from actuarial assumptions and analysis 
we expect that a large portion of health care claims will typically not be submitted until after the end of the quarter in which providers render services to members 
as a result  subject matter knowledge is used in this estimation process  considerable variability is inherent in such estimates  and the adequacy of the estimate is highly sensitive to changes in medical claims payment patterns and changes in medical cost trends the rate of increase in medical costs 
a worsening or improvement of medical cost trend or changes in claim payment patterns from assumptions used to estimate the reserves would cause such estimates to change in the near term  and such a change could be material 
our profitability may be adversely affected if we are unable to contract with providers on favorable terms and otherwise maintain favorable provider relationships 
our profitability is dependent in part upon our ability to contract on favorable terms with hospitals  physicians and other health benefits providers 
this ability to contract is affected both by the rates for provider services  and by our provider payment and other provider relations practices 
the sufficiency and quality of our networks of available providers is also an important factor when customers consider our products and services 
the failure to maintain or to secure new cost effective health care provider contracts may result in a loss in membership and or higher medical costs 
we must demonstrate that our products and processes facilitate access by members to quality care delivered by their providers 
failure to demonstrate that our products and processes such as disease management programs  provider credentialing and other quality of care and information management initiatives facilitate access by members to quality care by providers would adversely affect our ability to differentiate our product and or service offerings from those of competitors 
we outsource and obtain certain information technology systems or other services from independent third parties 
although we will take steps to monitor and regulate the performance of independent third parties who provide services to us or to whom we delegate selected functions  these arrangements may make our operations vulnerable if those third parties fail to satisfy their obligations to us  whether because of our failure to adequately monitor and regulate their performance  changes in their own financial condition  or other matters outside our control 
certain legislative authorities have  in recent periods also discussed or proposed legislation that would restrict outsourcing and  if enacted  could materially increase our costs 
government payors can determine premiums 
in our government funded health programs  such as our snp programs  the government payor determines the premium levels 
if the government payor reduces the premium levels or increases premiums by less than our costs of service increase  and if we cannot offset these with supplemental premiums and changes in benefit plans  then we could be materially adversely affected 
our future business activities will be highly regulated  further regulation could also materially adversely affect our business 
our future business will be subject to extensive regulation and oversight by state and federal governmental authorities 
the federal and many state governments have enacted and continue to consider legislative and regulatory changes related to health products 
at this time  we are unable to predict the impact of future changes  although we anticipate that some of these measures  if enacted  could adversely affect health operations through affecting premium rates  reducing our ability to manage medical costs  increasing medical costs and operating expenses  increasing our exposure to lawsuits  regulating levels and permitted lines of business  imposing financial assessments  and regulating business practices 
recently  there has been heightened review by regulators of the health care insurance industry s business practices  these include utilization management and claim payment practices as well as review of the general insurance industry s brokerage practices 
these regulatory reviews could result in changes to or clarifications of our business practices  and also could result in material fines  penalties  or other sanctions 
our business also may be adversely impacted by judicial and regulatory decisions that expand the interpretations of existing statutes and regulations  impose medical or bad faith liability  increase our responsibilities under erisa  or reduce the scope of erisa pre emption of state law claims 
we also face other risks that could adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition  which include any requirement to restate financial results in the event of inappropriate application of accounting principles  financial loss from inadequate insurance coverage due to self insurance levels or unavailability of coverage for credit or other reasons  failure of our processes to prevent and detect unethical conduct of employees  a significant failure of internal controls over financial reporting  failure of our prevention and control systems related to employee compliance with internal policies  provider fraud that is not prevented or detected and impacts our medical costs or those of self insured customers  and failure of corporate governance policies and procedures 
we undertake no obligation to update or revise any such forward looking statements
