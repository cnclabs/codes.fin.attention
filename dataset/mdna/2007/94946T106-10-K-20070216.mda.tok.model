item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data beginning on page and our combined and consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management s expectations 
factors that could cause such differences include those set forth under risk factors  forward looking statements  business and elsewhere in this report 

back to table of contents overview we provide managed care services exclusively to government sponsored healthcare programs  focusing on medicare and medicaid 
we offer a variety of medicare and medicaid plans  including health plans for families  children  the aged  blind and disabled and prescription drug plans  as of december  serving over  members nationwide 
medicaid was established under the us social security act of to provide medical assistance to low income and disabled persons 
it is state operated and implemented  although it is funded by both the state and federal governments 
our medicaid plans include plans for individuals who are dually eligible for both medicare and medicaid  and recipients of the temporary assistance to needy families tanf programs  supplemental security income ssi programs  state children s health insurance s chip programs  and the family health plus fhp programs 
the tanf program generally provides assistance to low income families with children and the ssi program generally provides assistance to low income aged  blind or disabled individuals 
families who exceed the income thresholds for medicaid may be able to qualify for the state s chip and fhp programs 
medicare is a federal program that provides eligible persons age and over and some disabled persons a variety of hospital  medical insurance and prescription drug benefits 
medicare is administered and funded by the federal centers for medicare medicaid services cms 
our medicare plans include stand alone prescription drug plans pdp and medicare advantage plans which include both medicare coordinated care mcc plans and medicare private fee for service pffs plans 
medicare advantage is medicare s managed care alternative to original medicare fee for service which individuals enroll into directly through cms 
mcc plans are plans that are administered through a health maintenance organization hmo and generally require members to seek health care services from a network of health care providers 
pffs plans are open access plans that allow members to be seen by any physician or facility that participates in the medicare program 
we believe that our experience in managing healthcare for this broad range of beneficiaries better positions us to capitalize on growth opportunities across all of these programs 
in addition  unlike many other managed care organizations that attempt to serve the general population through commercial health plans  we focus exclusively on serving individuals in government programs 
we believe that this focus allows us to better serve our members and providers and to more efficiently manage our operations 
we have centralized core functions  such as claims processing and medical management  combined with localized marketing and strong provider relationships 
we believe that this approach will allow us to continue effectively growing our business  both through organic growth and through acquisitions 
through our licensed subsidiaries  as of december   we operated our medicaid plans in florida  new york  connecticut  illinois  indiana  missouri  georgia and ohio and our mcc plans in florida  new york  connecticut  illinois  louisiana and georgia 
we also operate stand alone medicare pdp plans in all states and the district of columbia 
on january   we ceased offering medicaid plans in indiana  but began offering pffs plans to medicare beneficiaries in counties in states and washington  dc the following tables summarize our membership by segment and line of business as of december  and december  december  medicaid tanf s chip ssi fhp medicare ma pdp total 
back to table of contents on august   we were notified by the indiana office of medicaid policy and planning ompp that we were not selected for a new contract to provide managed care benefits to indiana medicaid recipients in our contract with the state expired on december  as a result  the associated indiana market intangible assets were deemed to have no further economic value 
accordingly  the remaining amortization on the assets with a net value of  that were purchased in was accelerated 
expense of  is included in depreciation and amortization expense in the annual statement of income 
our indiana membership and revenue represent and of total membership and annual revenue as of december   respectively 
management does not believe that the loss of this contract will have a material impact on our future operations 
we enter into contracts with government agencies that administer health benefits programs 
these contracts generally are subject to renewal every one to three years 
we receive premiums from state and federal agencies for the members that are assigned to or have selected us to provide healthcare services under each benefit program 
the amount of premiums we receive for each member is fixed  although it varies according to demographics  including the government program  and the member s geographic location  age and gender  and the premiums are subject to periodic adjustments 
our largest expense is the cost of medical benefits that we provide  which is based primarily on our arrangements with healthcare providers 
our profitability depends on our ability to predict and effectively manage medical benefits expense relative to the fixed premiums we receive 
our arrangements with providers fall into two broad categories capitation arrangements  where we pay the capitated providers a fixed fee per member  and fee for service and risk sharing arrangements  where we assume all or part of the risk of the cost of the healthcare provided 
generally  capitation payments represent or less of our total medical benefits expense 
other components of medical benefits expense are variable and require estimation and ongoing cost management 
estimation of medical benefits expense is our most significant critical accounting estimate 
see critical accounting policies 
we use a variety of techniques to manage our medical benefits expense  including payment methods to providers  referral requirements  quality and disease management programs  reinsurance and member co payments and premiums for some of our medicare plans 
national healthcare costs have been increasing at a higher rate than the general inflation rate  however  and relatively small changes in our medical benefits expense relative to premiums that we receive can create significant changes in our financial results 
changes in healthcare laws  regulations and practices  levels of use of healthcare services  competitive pressures  hospital costs  major epidemics  terrorism or bio terrorism  new medical technologies and other external factors could reduce our ability to manage our medical benefits expense effectively 
one of our primary tools for measuring profitability is our medical benefits ratio  the ratio of our medical benefits expense to the premiums we receive 
changes in the medical benefits ratio from period to period result from  among other things  changes in medicaid and medicare funding  changes in the mix of medicaid and medicare membership  our ability to manage medical costs and changes in accounting estimates related to incurred but not reported claims 
we use medical benefits ratios both to monitor our management of medical benefits expense and to make various business decisions  including what healthcare plans to offer  what geographic areas to enter or exit and the selection of healthcare providers 
although medical benefits ratios play an important role in our business strategy  we may be willing to enter into provider arrangements that might produce a less favorable medical benefits ratio if those arrangements  such as capitation or risk sharing  would likely lower our exposure to variability in medical costs 
basis of presentation the consolidated results of operations include the accounts of wellcare health plans  inc and all of its subsidiaries 
significant inter company accounts and transactions have been eliminated 
segments we have two reportable business segments medicaid and medicare 
medicaid medicaid  a state administered program  was enacted in to make federal matching funds available to all states for the delivery of healthcare benefits to eligible individuals  principally those with incomes below specified levels who meet other state specified requirements 
medicaid is structured to allow each state to establish its own eligibility standards  benefits package  payment rates and program administration under broad federal guidelines 
most states determine threshold medicaid eligibility by reference to other federal financial assistance programs including the tanf and ssi programs 

back to table of contents the tanf program provides assistance to low income families with children and was adopted to replace the aid to families with dependent children program 
ssi is a federal program that provides assistance to low income aged  blind or disabled individuals 
however  states can broaden eligibility criteria 
s chip  developed in  is a federal state matching program that provides healthcare coverage to children in low income families not otherwise covered by medicaid or other insurance programs 
it must be reauthorized by congress this year 
s chip enables a segment of the large uninsured population in the united states to receive healthcare benefits 
states have the option of administering s chip through their medicaid programs 
fhp is a new york state program that provides health insurance for certain adults and their families between the ages of and who do not have health insurance on their own  but have income too high to qualify for medicaid 
medicare medicare is a federal program that provides eligible persons age and over and some disabled persons a variety of hospital  medical insurance and prescription drug benefits 
most individuals eligible for medicare are entitled to receive inpatient hospital care without the payment of any premium  but are required to pay a premium to the federal government  which is adjusted annually  to be eligible for physician care and other services 
under the ma program  managed care plans can contract with cms to provide health insurance coverage in exchange for a fixed monthly payment per member based on the geographic area in which the member resides 
the fixed monthly payment per member is subject to periodic adjustments determined by cms based upon a number of factors  including retroactive changes in members status such as medicaid eligibility  and risk measures based on demographic factors such as age  gender  county of residence and health status 
the weighting of the risk measures in the determination of the amount of the periodic adjustments to the fixed monthly payments was phased in over time  and first became fully implemented in individuals who elect to participate in the ma program are relieved of the obligation to pay some or all of the deductible or coinsurance amounts required under the original medicare fee for service program  but  in the case of mcc plans  are generally required to use services provided by the ma plan s network providers  and may be required to pay a premium to the federal medicare program unless the ma plan chooses to pay the premium as part of its benefit package 
as part of the medicare reform legislation known as the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  or mma  beginning in january  medicare recipients were provided the opportunity to select a prescription drug plan through medicare part d  largely funded by the federal government 
the medicare part d benefit is available to medicare managed care enrollees as well as medicare fee for service enrollees 
mcc plans are required to offer a plan that includes part d drug benefits  called a ma pd plan  in every region in which they operate 
the medicare part d benefit  which provides prescription drug benefits  is available to medicare advantage enrollees as well as original medicare fee for service enrollees 
mcc plans are required to offer a part d drug benefit  whereas pffs plans have the option of providing a part d benefit  but are not required to do so 
most of our pffs products offer a part d benefit 
mcc plans and pffs plans that include a part d drug benefit are also known as ma pd plans 
original medicare fee for service beneficiaries and pffs enrollees are able to purchase a stand alone prescription drug plan  called a pdp plan  from a list of cms approved pdp plans  such as ours 
we have experienced and continue to expect seasonality and fluctuations in our pdp earnings on a quarterly basis resulting from the design of our benefits and the interaction of various product features  such as deductibles  co payments  the coverage gap  catastrophic coverage  risk corridors and reinsurance arrangements  all of which will impact our pdp earnings 
our pdp medical costs will be higher in the first half of the year than in the second half of the year 
as a result  our net income margins to be lower in the first half of the year and to increase in the second half of the year 
we purchased a one year  nonrenewable  aggregate reinsurance policy for calendar year to mitigate the risks associated with our new pdp product by complementing the risk corridor protection and catastrophic coverage provided by cms under the medicare part d program 
the terms of this aggregate reinsurance policy resulted in higher recoveries in periods of higher medical benefits ratios and lower or no recoveries in periods of lower medical benefits ratios 
the recoveries and net reinsurance impact under this aggregate reinsurance policy were cumulative over the one year term of the policy 
the medical benefits ratio of our pdp business in fiscal year resulted in a net reinsurance expense of million which unfavorably impacted the year to date gross profit on our medicare segment 
the results of our pdp business in the fourth quarter of were favorably impacted by increased membership coupled with favorable medical utilization and cost trends  resulting in lower medical benefits ratios 
as a result  the gross profit on our medicare segment in the fourth quarter was favorably impacted by a refund of premium of million based on our favorable experience for the three month period ended december  our net income was reduced by million of net reinsurance expense 
in light of the pdp bid results and our experience with the pdp product  we have not purchased a similar reinsurance arrangement in 
back to table of contents critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of our results of operations and financial condition in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the accounting policies discussed below are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition 
our medicaid contracts with state governments are generally multi year contracts subject to annual renewal provisions 
our medicare advantage and pdp contracts with cms generally have terms of one year 
we generally receive premiums in advance of providing services  and recognize premium revenue during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members 
premiums are billed monthly for coverage in the following month and are recognized as revenue in the month for which insurance coverage is provided 
we estimate  on an ongoing basis  the amount of member billings that may not be fully collectible based on historical trends and other factors 
an allowance is established for the estimated amount that may not be collectible 
this allowance has not been significant to premium revenue 
the payment we receive monthly from cms for our pdp program generally represents our bid amount for providing prescription drug insurance coverage 
we recognize premium revenue for providing this insurance coverage ratably over the term of our annual contract 
however  our cms payment is subject to i risk corridor adjustments and ii subsidies in order for us and cms to share the risk associated with financing the ultimate costs of the part d benefit 
the amount of revenue payable to a plan by cms is subject to adjustment  positive or negative  based upon the application of risk corridors that compare a plan s revenues targeted in their bids target amount to actual prescription drug costs 
variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in cms making additional payments to us or require us to refund to cms a portion of the premiums we received 
actual prescription drug costs subject to risk sharing with cms are limited to the costs that are  or would have been  incurred under the cms defined standard benefit plan allowable risk corridor costs 
we estimate and recognize an adjustment to premium revenues related to the risk corridor payment adjustment based upon pharmacy claims experience to date as if the annual contract were to terminate at the end of each reporting period 
accordingly  this estimate provides no consideration to future pharmacy claims experience 
premiums collected in advance are deferred and reported as unearned premiums in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  any amounts that have not been received by the end of the period remain on the balance sheet classified as premium receivables 
premium payments that we receive are based upon eligibility lists produced by the government 
from time to time  states require us to reimburse them for premiums that we received from the states based on an eligibility list that a state later discovers contains individuals who were not eligible for any government sponsored program or are eligible for a different premium category or a different program 
we record adjustments to revenues based on member retroactivity 
these adjustments reflect changes in the number of and eligibility status of enrollees subsequent to when revenue was billed 
we estimate the amount of outstanding retroactivity each period and adjust premium revenue accordingly  if appropriate 
the estimates of retroactivity adjustments are based on historical trends  premiums billed  the volume of member and contract renewal activity and other information 
our government contracts establish monthly rates per member  but may have additional amounts due to us based on items such as age  working status or specific health issues of the member 
for example  cms has implemented a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all medicare plans according to the health status of each beneficiary enrolled 
the cms risk adjustment model pays more for medicare members with predictably higher costs 
under this risk adjustment methodology  diagnosis data from inpatient and ambulatory treatment settings are used to calculate the risk adjusted premium payment to us 
we collect  capture and submit the necessary diagnosis data to cms within prescribed deadlines 
we estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted to cms and ultimately accepted by cms 

back to table of contents cms transitioned to the risk adjustment model while the old demographic model was being phased out 
the demographic model based the monthly premiums paid to medicare plans on factors such as age  gender and disability status 
the monthly premium amount for each member was separately determined under both the risk adjustment and demographic model  and these separate payment amounts were blended according to a transition schedule 
is the first year in which risk adjusted payment for health plans is fully phased in 
the pdp payment methodology is based on the risk adjustment model which began in as a result of this process and the phasing in of the risk adjustment model  our cms monthly premium payments per member may change materially  either favorably or unfavorably 
estimating medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable 
the cost of medical benefits is recognized in the period in which services are provided and includes an estimate of the cost of medical benefits that have been incurred but not yet reported 
we contract with various healthcare providers for the provision of certain medical care services to our members and generally compensate those providers on a fee for service or capitated basis or pursuant to certain risk sharing arrangements 
capitation represents fixed payments generally on a per member per month  or pmpm  basis to participating physicians and other medical specialists as compensation for providing comprehensive healthcare services 
by the terms of our capitation agreements  capitation payments we make to capitated providers alleviate any further obligation we have to pay the capitated provider for the actual medical expenses of the member 
participating physician capitation payments for the years ended december   and were  and  respectively  of total medical benefits expense 
medical benefits expense has two main components direct medical expenses and medically related administrative costs 
direct medical expenses include amounts paid to hospitals  physicians and providers of ancillary services  such as laboratory and pharmacy 
medically related administrative costs include items such as case and disease management  utilization review services  quality assurance and on call nurses 
medical benefits payable represents amounts for claims fully adjudicated awaiting payment disbursement and estimates for incurred  but not yet reported claims 
the following table provides a reconciliation of the total medical benefits payable balances as of december  and december  of total december  of total in thousands claims adjudicated  but not yet paid ibnr total medical benefits payable we have used the same methodology for estimating our medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable since our acquisition of the wellcare group of companies in our policy is to record management s best estimate of medical benefits payable 
monthly  we estimate ultimate benefits payable based upon historical experience and other available information as well as assumptions about emerging trends  which vary by business segment 
the process for preparing the estimate utilizes standard actuarial methodologies based on historical data 
these standard actuarial methodologies include  among other factors  contractual requirements  historical utilization trends  the interval between the date services are rendered and the date claims are paid  denied claims activity  disputed claims activity  benefit changes  expected health care cost inflation  seasonality patterns and changes in membership 
in developing the estimate  we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated 
for the more recent months  which constitute the majority of the amount of the medical benefits payable  we estimate our claims incurred by applying observed trend factors to the pmpm costs for prior months  which costs have been estimated using completion factors  in order to estimate the pmpm costs for the most recent months 
we validate our estimates of the most recent pmpm costs by comparing the most recent months utilization levels to the utilization levels in older months  actuarial techniques that incorporate a historical analysis of claim payments  including trends in cost of care provided  and timeliness of submission and processing of claims 
also included in medical benefits payable are estimates for provider settlements due to clarification of contract terms  out of network reimbursement and claims payment differences  as well as amounts due to contracted providers under risk sharing arrangements 
many aspects of the managed care business are not predictable with consistency 
these aspects include the incidences of illness or disease state such as cardiac heart failure cases  cases of upper respiratory illness  the length and severity of the flu season  diabetes  the number of full term versus premature births and the number of neonatal intensive care babies 
therefore  we must rely upon our historical experience  as continually monitored  to reflect the ever changing mix  needs and growth of our members in our trend assumptions 
among the factors considered by management are changes in the level of benefits provided to members  seasonal variations in utilization  identified industry trends and changes in provider reimbursement arrangements  including changes in the percentage of reimbursements made on a capitated  as opposed to a fee for service  basis 
these considerations are aggregated in the trend in medical benefits expense 
other external factors such as government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes  catastrophes and epidemics may impact medical cost trends 
other internal factors such as system conversions and claims processing interruptions may impact our ability to accurately predict estimates of historical completion factors or medical cost trends 
medical cost trends potentially are more volatile than other segments of the economy 
management is required to use considerable judgment in the selection of medical benefits expense trends and other actuarial model inputs 

back to table of contents we record reserves for estimated referral claims related to healthcare providers under contract with us who are financially troubled or insolvent and who may not be able to honor their obligations for the costs of medical services provided by other providers 
in these instances  we may be required to honor these obligations for legal or business reasons 
based on our current assessment of providers under contract with us  such losses have not been and are not expected to be significant 
changes in estimates of medical benefits payable are primarily the result of obtaining more complete claims information that directly correlates with the claims and provider reimbursement trends 
volatility in members needs for medical services  provider claims submission and our payment processes results in identifiable patterns emerging several months after the causes of deviations from assumed trends occur 
since our estimates are based upon pmpm claims experience  changes cannot typically be explained by any single factor  but are the result of a number of interrelated variables  all influencing the resulting experienced medical cost trend 
deviations  whether positive or negative  between actual experience and estimates used to establish the liability are recorded in the period known 
the following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of medical benefits payable for the following periods year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  in thousands balances as of beginning of period opening medical benefits payable related to harmony acquisition medical benefits incurred related to current period prior periods total medical benefits paid related to current period prior periods total balances as of end of period medical benefits payable recorded at december  developed favorably by approximately million 
this favorable development was primarily due to realized medical benefits expense trends that were less than initially assumed trends 
we initially assumed a medical benefits expense trend increase of and an increase of for the medicaid and medicare segments  respectively  at december  due to data available at the time of the estimate utilized in developing assumptions that suggested less favorable product benefit design and increased member utilization 
based upon payments made subsequent to december   for dates of service prior to december   the realized trends were an increase of for the medicaid segment and an increase of for the medicare segment 
medical benefits payable recorded at december  developed favorably by approximately million 
this favorable development was primarily due to realized medical benefits expense trends that were less than initially assumed trends 
we initially assumed a medical benefits expense trend increase of and a decrease of for the medicaid and medicare segments  respectively  at december  due to data available at the time of the estimate utilized in developing assumptions that suggested less favorable product benefit design and increased member utilization 
based upon payments made subsequent to december   for dates of service prior to december   the realized trends were an increase of for the medicaid segment and a decrease of for the medicare segment 
we believe that the amount of medical benefits payable as of december  is adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims as of that date  however  actual payments may differ from established estimates 
during the past five years  we have experienced favorable deviations from our estimated amounts in a range of to of total medical expenses  which would increase current year net income by approximately million to million if historical deviations remain consistent 
however  if we were to experience unfavorable trends within the same range  current year net income would decrease by approximately million to 
back to table of contents goodwill and intangible assets 
we obtained goodwill and intangible assets as a result of the acquisitions of our subsidiaries 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired 
intangible assets include provider networks  membership contracts  trademark  noncompete agreements  state contracts  licenses and permits 
our intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to years 
we evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets 
we must make assumptions and estimates  such as the discount factor  in determining the estimated fair values 
while we believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate  other assumptions and estimates could be applied and might produce significantly different results 
in august  we were notified by the indiana ompp that our medicaid contract would not be renewed in as a result  we performed a review of our intangible assets associated with the indiana market and deemed them to have no further economic value 
accordingly  the remaining amortization on the assets with a net value of million that were purchased in was accelerated 
expense of million is included in depreciation and amortization expense in our statement of income 
we review goodwill and intangible assets for impairment at least annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances occur that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill or intangible assets 
events or changes in circumstances would include significant changes in membership  state funding  medical contracts and provider networks 
we have selected the third quarter for our annual impairment test  which generally coincides with the finalization of state and federal rate and benefit negotiations and our initial budgeting process 
during the third quarter ended september   we assessed the earnings forecast for our two reporting units and concluded that the fair value of the individual reporting units  based upon the expected present value of future cash flows and other qualitative factors  was in excess of net assets of each reporting unit 
as of december   we believe that there is no impairment to the value of goodwill or intangible assets 
the purchase of our florida subsidiaries was partially financed through a contingent note payable to the former shareholders of those subsidiaries 
the principal amount of this note  which was paid in full on september   was subject to adjustment for various contingencies 
adjustments to the note resulted in an increase in the purchase price and the amount of goodwill acquired of million 
in june  we acquired harmony health systems  inc  a provider of medicaid managed care plans in illinois and indiana 
the purchase price for the acquisition was approximately million in cash  after deducting i pre closing cash distributions made by harmony to its equityholders and ii certain transaction expenses incurred by harmony or its shareholders 
in june  we made a subsequent payment of million as an adjustment in the purchase price to account for excess reserves for medical claims as of december  the payment was recorded as an addition to goodwill 
goodwill and other intangibles associated with the harmony acquisition were million 
we have acquired of the stock of three life and health insurance companies during through which we operate our pffs business 
the purchase price allocated to intangible assets consisted of state insurance licenses in the amount of million

back to table of contents one of our primary management tools for measuring profitability is our medical benefits ratio  the ratio of our medical benefits expense to the premiums we receive 
changes in the medical benefits ratio from period to period result from  among other things  changes in medicaid and medicare funding  changes in the mix of medicaid and medicare membership  our ability to manage medical costs and changes in accounting estimates related to incurred but not reported claims 
we use medical benefits ratios both to monitor our management of medical benefits expense and to make various business decisions  including what healthcare plans to offer  what geographic areas to enter or exit and the selection of healthcare providers 
although medical benefits ratios play an important role in our business strategy  we may be willing to enter into provider arrangements that might produce a less favorable medical benefits ratio if those arrangements  such as capitation or risk sharing  would likely lower our exposure to variability in medical costs 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  premium revenue 
for the year ended december   premium revenue increased  million  or  to  million from  million for the same period last year due to the addition of members  the mix of these members between our product lines and the demographic mix of our membership 
the increase is primarily attributable to the addition of members from membership growth in both our medicaid and medicare segments 
the medicaid segment increase is primarily due to the georgia launch and the medicare segment increase is principally the new pdp product offering 
total membership grew by  members  or  from  at december  to  at december medicaid 
our medicaid segment includes medicaid programs and other state sponsored healthcare programs 
for the year ended december   medicaid segment premium revenue increased million  or  to  million from  million for the same period last year 
the increase in medicaid segment revenue is due to growth in membership  principally in georgia  coupled with increases in premium rates in certain markets

for the year ended december   medicare segment premium revenue increased  million  or  to  million from million for the same period last year 
growth in premium revenue within the medicare segment was primarily the result of pdp membership growth of  members and premium increases associated with the demographic mix of our medicare coordinated care plan membership 
membership within the medicare segment grew by  members  or  from  members at december  to  members at december   principally due to the new pdp product 
medicare revenues and membership for the year ended december  revenues of total premium revenues membership of total membership investment and other income 
for the year ended december   investment and other income increased million  or  to million from million for the same period last year 
the increase was due to increased cash and investment positions held throughout primarily from the new pdp and georgia businesses  as well as the higher interest rate environment 
the higher average cash and investment balances accounted for approximately million of the increase and the higher interest rate environment contributed approximately million to the increase 

back to table of contents medical benefits expense 
for the year ended december   medical benefits expense increased  million  or  to  million from  million for the same period last year 
the increase in medical benefits expense was due to the addition of members primarily from our georgia and pdp launch  the mix of these members between our product lines and the demographic mix of our membership

the membership increase  principally in our georgia market  accounted for million of the increase 
increased healthcare costs and the demographic change in membership accounted for million of the increase 
for the year ended december   the medicaid medical benefits ratio was compared to for the same period last year 
this decline resulted from premium rate increases  changes in the healthcare utilization pattern of our members and the demographic mix of our members in our existing markets  partially off set by the higher medical costs associated with our georgia launch

our selling  general and administrative expense to revenue ratio was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expense was primarily due to investments in information technology  investments in sales and marketing strategies and increased spending necessary to support and sustain our membership growth 
selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  sg a sg a expense to total revenue ratio interest expense 
interest expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase relates to the rising interest rate environment  off set by the reduced amount of debt outstanding due to the settlement of the related party note

each of our existing and projected sources of cash are impacted by operational and financial risks that influence the overall amount of cash generated and the capital available to us 
for a further discussion of risks that can impact our liquidity  see our risk factors beginning on page regulatory capital and restrictions on dividends and management fees 
we conduct our operations primarily through our hmo  insurance and other regulated subsidiaries 
these subsidiaries are subject to state regulations that  among other things  may require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital  as defined by each state 
these regulations may restrict the amount  payment  and timing of the distribution of dividends that may be paid to our parent company from our hmo  insurance and other regulated subsidiaries 
the regulators can also limit the ability of our companies to make inter company transfers  such as the payment of management fees 
the regulators can  in their sole discretion  require individual subsidiaries to maintain statutory capital levels higher than state mandated minimums 
the national association of insurance commissioners has adopted rules which  to the extent they are implemented by the states in which we operate  set minimum capitalization requirements for our hmos  insurance and other regulated entities 
the requirements take the form of risk based capital rules 
florida and new york have not yet adopted the risk based capital standard as a net worth requirement 
our operations in illinois  georgia  connecticut  louisiana  missouri  ohio  and our pffs operations are subject to the national association of insurance commissioners guidance

barring any change in regulatory requirements  we expect that we will continue to be in compliance with these requirements at least through for example  new york enacted regulations in that increase reserve requirements by over an eight year period  which will over time  materially increase the capital requirements of our new york managed care plan

the term loan matures in may  and the revolving credit facility will expire in may we are a party to this agreement for the purpose of guaranteeing the indebtedness of our subsidiaries that are parties to the agreement 
as of december   the revolving credit facility has not been utilized 
the credit agreement contains various restrictive covenants which limit  among other things  our ability to incur indebtedness and liens and to enter into business combination transactions

as of december   our credit ratings were as follows agency outlook credit rating moody s positive ba standard poor s positive bb consequently  if we seek to raise funds in capital markets transactions  our ability to do so will be limited to issuing additional non investment grade debt or issuing equity and or equity linked instruments 
we expect to fund our working capital requirements and capital expenditures during the next several years from our existing cash balances  our cash flow from operations  public offerings or other possible future capital markets transactions 
we have taken a number of steps to increase our internally generated cash flow  including reducing our health care expenses by  among other things  exiting from unprofitable markets and undertaking cost savings initiatives 
from time to time  we may need to draw upon available funds under our revolving credit facility  which matures in may  or issue additional debt or equity securities if our cash flow from operations is inadequate to support expansion activities 
based on the above  we believe that we will be able to adequately fund our current and long term capital needs 
a failure to comply with any covenant in our credit facilities could make funds under our credit facilities unavailable 
we also may be required to take additional actions to reduce our cash flow requirements  including the deferral of planned investments aimed at reducing our selling  general and administrative expenses 
the deferral or cancellation of any investments could have a material adverse impact on our ability to meet our short term business objectives 
we regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations and commitments  and for capital acquisitions and other strategic transactions 
we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes either through additional debt or equity  the sale of investment securities or otherwise as appropriate

it also provides guidance on the recognition  measurement and classification of income tax uncertainties  along with any related interest and penalties 
previously recorded income tax benefits that no longer meet this standard are required to be charged to earnings in the period that such determination is made

sab provides guidance on how prior year misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements for purposes of assessing materiality 
sab requires that registrants quantify errors using both a balance sheet and income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that  when relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending after november  sab permits companies to initially apply its provisions by either restating prior financial statements or recording a cumulative effect adjustment to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of january  with an offsetting adjustment to retained earnings for errors that were previously deemed immaterial but are material under the guidance in sab the adoption of this bulletin did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

back to table of contents item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk as of december  and  we had short term investments of million and million  respectively  and investments classified as long term of million and million  respectively  principally restricted deposits in accordance with regulatory requirements 
the short term investments consist of highly liquid securities with maturities between three and months 
long term restricted assets consist of cash and cash equivalents and us treasury instruments deposited or pledged to state agencies in accordance with state rules and regulations 
these restricted assets are classified as long term regardless of the contractual maturity date due to the nature of the states requirements 
the investments classified as long term are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase 
because of their short term nature  however  we would not expect the value of these investments to decline significantly as a result of a sudden change in market interest rates 
assuming a hypothetical and immediate increase in market interest rates as of december   the fair value of our fixed income investments would decrease by less than million 
similarly  a decrease in market interest rates at december  would result in an increase of the fair value of our investments by less than million
