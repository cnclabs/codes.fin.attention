both of these loans mature during august in addition  we have arranged for the provision of five separate letters of credit in connection with certain leases and investments 
as of december   there was no balance outstanding under any of the letters of credit 
if the letters of credit were fully drawn  the combined maximum amount of exposure would be approximately million 
historical cash flow the following discussion of historical cash flow compares our cash flow for the year ended december  with our cash flow for the year ended december  cash and cash equivalents were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the increase of million was a result of the following increases and decreases in cash flows years ended december  amounts in millions variance net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities totals the variance in net cash provided by operating activities resulted from a decrease of million in operating income before non cash expenses in  which was primarily due to million of distributions of operating income from unconsolidated affiliates as a result of the distributions from mervyns in  as well as those factors discussed within item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  a net increase of million resulted from changes in operating assets and liabilities  primarily rents receivable  prepaid expenses and other assets 
the decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily the result of a million decrease in cash used for real estate acquisitions  development and tenant installations  million of additional proceeds from the sale of properties in  a net decrease of million related to the levitz preferred equity investment note and the levitz note receivable note activity and million of additional return of capital from unconsolidated affiliates in these net decreases were offset by million of additional investments in unconsolidated partnerships  primarily the albertsons investment in and million of additional notes issued in the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities resulted primarily from million of additional cash used for the net repayment of debt in and million of additional distributions to partners and members in  primarily relating to the mervyns investment 
these net decreases were partially offset by million of proceeds from the convertible debt issuance in 
table of contents critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used by us in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
valuation of property held for use and sale on a quarterly basis  we review the carrying value of both properties held for use and for sale 
we record impairment losses and reduce the carrying value of properties when indicators of impairment are present and the expected undiscounted cash flows related to those properties are less than their carrying amounts 
in cases where we do not expect to recover our carrying costs on properties held for use  we reduce our carrying cost to fair value 
for properties held for sale  we reduce our carrying value to the fair value less costs to sell 
for the year ended december   no impairment loss was recognized 
for the year ended december   an impairment loss of million was recognized related to a property that was sold in july of management does not believe that the value of any properties in its portfolio was impaired as of december  or bad debts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make payments on arrearages in billed rents  as well as the likelihood that tenants will not have the ability to make payment on unbilled rents including estimated expense recoveries and straight line rent 
as of december   we had recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
if the financial condition of our tenants were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inflation our long term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on our net income 
such provisions include clauses enabling us to receive percentage rents based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or  in certain cases  escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
such escalation clauses are often related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indexes 
in addition  many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years  which permits us to seek to increase rents upon re rental at market rates if current rents are below the then existing market rates 
most of our leases require the tenants to pay their share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
recently issued accounting pronouncements reference is made to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates related to our mortgage debt 
see the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this annual report on form k for certain quantitative details related to our mortgage debt 
currently  we manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates primarily through the use of fixed rate debt and interest rate swap agreements 
as of december   we had total mortgage debt of million of which million  or  was fixed rate  inclusive of interest rate swaps  and million  or  was variable rate based upon libor plus certain spreads 
as of december   we were a party to two interest rate swap transactions to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates with respect to million of libor based variable rate debt 
we also have one forward starting interest rate swap which commences during and matures in that will hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates with respect to million of refinanced libor based variable rate debt with the matching maturities 
the following table sets forth information as of december  concerning our long term debt obligations  including principal cash flows by scheduled maturity and weighted average interest rates of maturing amounts amounts in millions consolidated mortgage debt weighted scheduled average year amortization maturities total interest rate thereafter mortgage debt in unconsolidated partnerships at our pro rata share weighted scheduled average year amortization maturities total interest rate n a n a n a n a thereafter of our total consolidated and our pro rata share of unconsolidated outstanding debt  million and million will become due in and  respectively 
as we intend on refinancing some or all of such debt at the then existing market interest rates which may be greater than the current interest rate  our interest expense would increase by approximately million annually if the interest rate on the refinanced debt increased by basis points 
interest expense on our variable debt of million as of december  would increase million if libor increased by basis points 
we may seek additional variable rate financing if and when pricing and other commercial and financial terms warrant 
as such  we would consider hedging against the interest rate risk related to such additional variable rate debt through interest rate swaps and protection agreements  or other means 
based on our outstanding debt balances as of december   the fair value of our total outstanding debt would decrease by approximately million if interest rates increase by 
conversely  if interest rates decrease by  the fair value of our total outstanding debt would increase by approximately million
