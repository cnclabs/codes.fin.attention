table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general we have four major product categories graphite electrodes  advanced graphite materials  carbon refractories  and natural graphite 
reportable segments 
previously  our businesses reported in the following reportable segments synthetic graphite  which consisted of graphite electrodes  cathodes and advanced graphite materials and related services  and other  which consisted of natural graphite  carbon electrodes  and refractories and related services 
in the fourth quarter of  we sold our cathode assets including our interest in carbone savoie for million less certain price adjustments and the purchaser s assumption of liabilities 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we have classified this business as discontinued operations and have reflected this change for all periods contained within this report 
as a result of the sale  the structure of our organization as well as the methods and information used by the chief operating decision maker to allocate resources and assess performance was realigned to meet improved corporate goals and strategies 
with these changes  we evaluated our reportable segments and have concluded that our graphite electrode and advanced graphite materials businesses are now reportable segments under sfas no 
the remaining operating segments  natural graphite products  refractories  and carbon electrodes are combined as other businesses and shown as a third segment 
the segment information throughout this section of the report has been adjusted to reflect these segments 
graphite electrode  which primarily serves the steel industry and includes graphite electrode product operations and related services 
advanced graphite materials  which includes primary and specialty products and related services for the transportation  semiconductor and other markets 
other businesses  which includes natural graphite products  refractories and carbon electrodes 
reference is made to the information under part i for background information on our businesses  industry and related matters 
update to previously released preliminary unaudited results 
on february   we announced preliminary and unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and end year ended december   including net income for of million 
in march of but prior to filing this form k  we announced certain changes in our results that were identified during our year end review process 
as a result of these changes  our net income increased to million 
the increase is primarily due to additional income related to the remeasurement of non dollar denominated intercompany loans 
the remeasurement changed other income expense  net  in the consolidated statement of operations from expense of million to income of million 
global economic conditions and outlook we are impacted in varying degrees  both positively and negatively  as global  regional or country conditions fluctuate 
and overall  global and regional economic conditions strengthened throughout and remained relatively stable in we estimate that worldwide steel production was about billion metric tons in and billion metric tons in  about a and increase  respectively  over the prior year 
in  worldwide graphite electrode demand increased to approximately million metric tons driven by increased steel production and  in particular  eaf steel production 
in  china s steel production grew almost  a faster rate than the worldwide market  and represented the single largest contributor to the growth in global steel demand 
chinese steel production was approximately blast oxygen furnace related 
however  china also was the growth leader for new eaf steel production 
overall  eaf steel production capacity grew  primarily driven by new eaf furnaces in china  and to a lesser extent  in russia  the middle east and north 
table of contents america 
this contributed to a favorable global pricing environment in and demand for our advanced graphite materials increased significantly in and  as compared to the increases were mainly in the energy related markets  including solar  silicon and oil and gas exploration  and defense and transportation industries 
we operated our advanced graphite materials capacity at very high levels in overall  global and regional economic conditions remained relatively stable in we estimate that worldwide steel production was about billion metric tons in  about a increase as compared to china s steel production continued to grow at a faster rate than the worldwide market 
in  china s production grew almost and represented the single largest contributor to the growth in global steel demand 
chinese steel production remained approximately blast oxygen furnace related 
however  china also remains the growth leader for new eaf steel production 
overall  eaf steel production capacity continued to grow  primarily driven by new eaf furnaces in china  and to a lesser extent  in russia  the middle east and north america 
this contributed to a more favorable global pricing environment in demand for our advanced graphite materials increased significantly in as compared to the increases were mainly in the energy related markets  including solar  silicon and oil and gas exploration  and defense and transportation industries 
we operated our advanced graphite materials capacity at very high levels in outlook 
global and regional economic conditions are expected to remain relatively stable in we estimate that worldwide total steel production will increase to about billion metric tons in  about higher than in global eaf steel production is expected to grow approximately 
worldwide graphite electrode demand is also expected to remain stable in we expect demand growth from the eaf steel market of about 
this increase in eaf demand is expected to be offset by a decrease in consumption 
as such  overall graphite electrode demand is expected to remain flat compared to we expect net sales of graphite electrodes to increase approximately over we expect graphite electrode sales volume to be approximately  metric tons  depending on market conditions 
we expect upward pressure on most of our raw material costs  including freight  energy and petroleum based raw materials 
these cost increases will impact almost all of our product lines 
in  we believe that the overall demand for advanced graphite materials will remain at a high level  resulting from continued strength in the energy markets and defense and transportation industries 
the continued overall strength of the economy in the markets served has kept the demand high for our core products which are used in the industrial and chemical sectors 
as a result of this high demand  we continue to be virtually sold out at full capacity in due to the cathodes divestiture we have approximately lower capacity than we had prior to the divestiture 
we expect capital expenditures to be approximately million 
we expect depreciation expense to be approximately million  and interest expense to be approximately million 
our sales of carbon electrodes will be less in due to our planned exiting of that business by the end of our outlook could be significantly impacted by  among other things  factors described under item a risk factors and item a forward looking statements in this report 
financing transactions during  we repurchased senior notes for cash or in exchange for shares of our common stock 
see note to the consolidated financial statement for more detailed information 
on january   we completed an offering of million aggregate principal amount of debentures at a price of of principal amount 
the net proceeds from the offering were approximately million 
we used the net proceeds to repay the remaining million of term loans outstanding under the senior facilities  to make provisional payments of million against the fine the eu antitrust fine that was assessed against us in by the directorate 
table of contents general iv of the european communities the eu competition authority  and to fund general corporate purposes  including replacement of financing previously provided by factoring of accounts receivable that are complementary to our businesses 
the balance was invested in short term  investment quality  interest bearing securities or deposits 
on february   we completed a substantial amendment and restatement of the credit agreement to effect a refinancing of the revolving facility 
we believe the refinancing has enhanced our stability and liquidity 
the revolving facility now provides for loans and letters of credit in a maximum amount outstanding at any time of up to million and matures in july as a result of the refinancing  we have no material debt scheduled to mature prior to july on january   we and certain of our subsidiaries requested us bank national association  as trustee  to redeem million of the outstanding principal amount of the senior notes due  at of the principal amount  plus accrued interest 
this redemption occurred in february we also plan to redeem an additional million in march after these redemptions  million in principal of the senior notes remains outstanding 
antitrust litigation against us beginning in  the united states department of justice doj and other foreign antitrust authorities commenced investigations into alleged violations of the antitrust laws in connection with the sale of graphite electrodes 
these antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims have been resolved 
several of the investigations resulted in the imposition of fines against us which have been timely paid 
at december  and december   respectively  million and million remained in the reserve for liabilities and expenses in connection with these antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims  which have also been resolved 
in january  we paid the last scheduled installment of the fine imposed by the doj 
other proceedings against us we are involved in various other investigations  lawsuits  claims  demands  environmental compliance programs  and other legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of our business 
while it is not possible to determine the ultimate disposition of each of these matters and proceedings  we do not believe that their ultimate disposition will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
realizability of net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances at december   we had million of gross deferred income tax assets  of which million required a valuation allowance 
our valuation allowance does not affect our ability and intent to utilize the deferred income tax assets as we generate sufficient future profitability 
in addition  we had million of gross deferred income tax liabilities 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are classified on a net current and net non current basis for each tax jurisdiction 
the net change in gross deferred income tax assets for was a decrease of million  of which million was related to utilization of net operating losses and foreign tax credits  which had a full valuation allowance against them 
the net change in the total valuation allowance for was a decrease of million 
we are executing current strategies  and developing future strategies  to improve sales  reduce costs and improve our capital structure in order to improve us taxable income to a level sufficient to fully realize these benefits in future years 
the current us tax attributes  if utilized  will allow us to significantly reduce our cash tax obligations in the us we currently expect our overall book tax rate to be to

sales of our products to customers outside the us accounted for about of our net sales in  of our net sales in  and of our sales in in  three of our ten largest customers were based in europe  two each in the us  south africa and mexico  and one in brazil 

table of contents in  our ten largest customers were purchasers of graphite electrode products 
no single customer or group of affiliated customers accounted for more than of our net sales in results of operations financial information discussed below excludes our cathodes business that was sold in december and has been accounted for as discontinued operations 
compared to consolidated 
net sales of million in represented a million  or  increase from net sales of million in net sales of graphite electrodes increased million primarily due to higher average graphite electrode sales revenue per metric ton  offset by lower sales volumes and a less favorable product sales mix 
advanced graphite materials net sales increased million due primarily to higher sales volumes and improved pricing 
cost of sales of million in represented a million  or  increase from cost of sales of million in cost of sales increased million due to higher operating costs  million due to the net unfavorable impacts of currency exchange rates and million due to other costs  partially offset by a decrease of million due to lower sales volumes  and million due to a favorable product mix 
gross profit of million in represented a million  or  increase from gross profit of million in gross margin increased to of net sales in from of net sales in selling and administrative increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase was primarily due to higher selling expenses of approximately million associated with higher net sales  increased employee compensation costs of approximately million million of which was associated with restricted stock grants  an increase in third party professional fees of million  and an increase of million of other costs 
research and development expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in  with the increase primarily due to increased headcount to support growth in our natural graphite business 
other income expense  net  was expense of million in as compared to expense of million in the net decrease in expense of million was primarily due to losses of million attributable to a reduction of senior notes outstanding due to debt for equity exchanges and repurchases occurred in  a decrease in expenses pertaining to legal  environmental and other related costs of million in as compared to  a decrease in non income tax charges of million for as compared to  benefits pertaining to foreign currency exchange rate contracts of million as gains were recognized in as compared to losses in  a decrease in fair value adjustment losses on interest rate caps of million for as compared to  and a net decrease in other costs of million  offset by losses due to changes in currency exchange rates  primarily associated with euro denominated inter company loans  increasing million for as compared to in  we recorded a net restructuring charge of million  comprised primarily of a million net benefit associated with the closure of our graphite electrode manufacturing operations in caserta  italy consisting of a reduction in cost estimate  partially offset by the completion of further severance agreements for employees terminated in connection with the closure  offset by a million charge relating primarily to severance programs and related benefits associated with the closure of our advanced graphite machining operations in sheffield  united kingdom and a million charge associated primarily with changes in estimates related to us voluntary and selective severance programs 
in  we recorded a net restructuring charge of million comprised primarily of the following a million charge associated with the rationalization of our graphite electrode facilities  including those in brazil  france  and russia  a net million charge associated with the closure of our graphite electrode manufacturing operations at caserta  italy and clarksville  tennessee

in  we recorded a million charge related to the impairment of our long lived carbon electrode fixed assets in columbia  tennessee as a result of our fourth quarter review of our carbon electrode forecasts 
the future estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of these assets were below their respective carrying amounts 
as a result  an impairment loss was measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and fair value  which was based on current estimates of market price 
we recorded a million charge for additional potential liabilities and expenses in connection with antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims in the first quarter 
this charge was offset by a gain due to the refund of million million based on currency exchange rates then in effect that we received from the eu competition authority as a result of the reduction of the eu antitrust fine to million  plus accrued interest of million which was calculated at a rate of per annum  an aggregate of about million at currency exchange rates in effect at the time the decision on our appeal thereof was issued

the following table represents our net sales by segment for the years ended december  and for the year ended december  dollars in thousands graphite electrode advanced graphite materials other businesses total net sales our analysis of the percentage change in net sales for graphite electrode and advanced graphite materials is set forth in the following table volume price mix currency other net change graphite electrode advanced graphite materials net sales for the graphite electrode segment increased primarily due to increased volumes and favorable price increases offset by an unfavorable product mix in compared to advanced graphite materials net sales increased based on higher volume and price increases during the year 
net sales for our other businesses decreased million  from million in to million in primarily related to decreased sales volumes of carbon electrodes  due to the planned exiting of this business  as well as decreased volumes for natural graphite  specifically electronic thermal management products 
segment operating net income 
corporate expenses are allocated to segments based on each segment s percentage of consolidated sales 
the following table represents our operating income by segment for the years ended december  and for the year ended december  dollars in thousands graphite electrode advanced graphite materials other businesses total segment operating income our analysis of the percentage change in segment operating expenses  including restructuring and impairment charges for graphite electrode and advanced graphite materials is set forth in the following table operating expenses change percentage of sales graphite electrode advanced graphite materials segment operating expenses as a percentage of sales for graphite electrodes decreased point to in however  total segment operating expenses increased million in this increase was due to higher raw material prices of million  higher volumes which increased total operating expenses an additional million  other increases in production operating costs totaling million  and an increase in employee compensation related to our incentive compensation program expenses of million 
restructuring and impairment costs increased million  primarily due to the impairment of the jd edwards jde software associated with increased sales and other overhead costs such as taxes and employee benefits and the write off of certain fixed assets in france 
table of contents during higher selling and administrative costs were responsible for the remainder of the increase and were the result of higher sales and other employee benefit costs 
segment operating expenses as a percentage of sales for advanced graphite materials increased points to in total segment operating expenses increased million  due primarily to increased sales volumes which increased costs million  other production costs of million including the costs associated with the realignment of advanced graphite materials operations  million of higher operating costs  including higher energy costs and increased selling and administrative expenses of million due to higher employee compensation costs of million related to our incentive compensation program 
segment operating expenses for other businesses decreased million  primarily attributable to a net million decrease in operating expenses related to carbon electrodes 
this decrease was caused by lower production costs and selling and administrative expenses due to lower volumes  offset by an increase of million for inventory adjustments and other restructuring costs 
segment operating expenses for refractories and natural graphite products decreased million  due to lower operating costs associated with lower volumes  offset slightly by higher employee compensation expenses 
the decrease in operating expenses was more than offset by a million decrease in net sales related to lower sales volume for carbon electrodes and natural graphite products 
overall  the carbon electrode operating loss accounted for about of the million segment operating loss 
effects of inflation we incur costs in the us and each of the five us countries in which we have a manufacturing facility 
in general  our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition are affected by the effects of inflation on our costs incurred in each of these countries 
see currency translation and transactions for a further discussion of highly inflationary countries 
during the past three years  we experienced higher freight  energy and other raw material costs primarily due to substantial increases in regional and worldwide market prices of natural gas and other petroleum based raw materials 
we seek to mitigate the effects of those increases on our cost of sales through improved operating efficiencies  higher prices for our products and ongoing cost savings  and  in some cases  fixed price or derivative contracts 
we have in the past entered into  and may in the future enter into  natural gas derivative contracts and short duration fixed rate purchase contracts to effectively fix some or all of our natural gas cost exposure 
currency translation and transactions we account for our non us subsidiaries under sfas no 
 foreign currency translation 
accordingly  except for highly inflationary countries  the assets and liabilities of our non us subsidiaries are translated into dollars for consolidation and reporting purposes 
foreign currency translation adjustments are generally recorded as part of stockholders deficit and identified as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets until such time as their operations are sold or substantially or completely liquidated 
we account for our russian and mexican subsidiaries using the dollar as the functional currency  as sales and purchases are predominantly dollar denominated 
our remaining subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional currency 
we also record foreign currency transaction gains and losses as part of other income expense  net 
significant changes in currency exchange rates impacting us are described under effects of changes in currency exchange rates and results of operations 
effects of changes in currency exchange rates we incur costs in dollars and the currency of each of the five non us countries in which we have a manufacturing facility  and we sell our products in multiple currencies 
in general  our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition are affected by changes in currency exchange rates affecting these currencies relative to the dollar and  to a limited extent  each other 

table of contents when the currencies of non us countries in which we have a manufacturing facility decline or increase in value relative to the dollar  this has the effect of reducing or increasing the dollar equivalent cost of sales and other expenses with respect to those facilities 
in certain countries where we have manufacturing facilities  and in certain instances where we price our products for sale in export markets  we sell in currencies other than the dollar 
accordingly  when these currencies increase or decline in value relative to the dollar  this has the effect of increasing or reducing net sales 
the result of these effects is to increase or decrease operating profit and net income 
many of the non us countries in which we have a manufacturing facility have been subject to significant economic changes  which have significantly impacted currency exchange rates 
we cannot predict changes in currency exchange rates in the future or whether those changes will have net positive or negative impacts on our net sales  cost of sales or net income 
during  the average exchange rate of the euro  south african rand  and brazilian real increased about  and  respectively  when compared to the average exchange rate for the mexican peso declined about when compared to the average exchange rate for during  the average exchange rate of the euro  the south african rand  the brazilian real and the mexican peso increased about   and  respectively  when compared to the average exchange rate for during  the average exchange rate of the brazilian real increased about when compared to the average exchange rate for the euro and the mexican peso did not fluctuate materially  and the south african rand decreased about when compared to the average exchange rate for in the case of net sales of graphite electrodes  the impact of these events was an increase of about million in  a decrease of about million in  and an increase of about million in in the case of cost of sales of graphite electrodes  the impact of these events was an increase of about million in  an increase of about million in  and an increase of about million in we have non dollar denominated intercompany loans between graftech finance and some of our foreign subsidiaries 
at december   the aggregate principal amount of these loans was million 
these loans are subject to remeasurement gains and losses due to changes in currency exchange rates 
a portion of these loans are deemed to be essentially permanent and  as a result  remeasurement gains and losses on these loans are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the stockholders deficit section of the consolidated balance sheets 
the balance of these loans is deemed to be temporary and  as a result  remeasurement gains and losses on these loans are recorded as currency gains losses in other income expense  net  on the consolidated statements of operations 
in  we had a net total of million in currency gains  including million of exchange gains due to the remeasurement of intercompany loans and translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiaries which use the dollar as their functional currency 
in  we had a net total of million of currency losses  including million of exchange losses due to the remeasurement of intercompany loans and translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiaries which use the dollar as their functional currency 
in  we had a net total of million of currency gains due to remeasurement of inter company loans and translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiaries which use the dollar as their functional currency 
we have in the past and may in the future use various financial instruments to manage certain exposures to specific financial market risks caused by changes in currency exchange rates  as described under item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
liquidity and capital resources our sources of funds have consisted principally of invested capital  cash flow from operations and debt and equity financings 
our uses of those funds other than for operations have consisted principally of capital expenditures  payment of fines  liabilities and expenses in connection with antitrust investigations  lawsuits and claims  payment of restructuring costs  pension and post retirement contributions  debt reduction payments and other obligations 

table of contents we are highly leveraged and have other substantial obligations 
at december   we had total debt of million  cash and cash equivalents of million and a stockholders deficit of million 
as part of our cash management activities  we manage accounts receivable credit risk  collections  and accounts payable and payments thereof to maximize our free cash at any given time and minimize accounts receivable losses 
certain subsidiaries sold receivables totaling million in and million in during  certain subsidiaries sold receivables totaling million  at a cost lower than the cost to borrow a comparable amount for a comparable period under the revolving facility 
proceeds of the sale of receivables were used to reduce debt 
if we had not sold such receivables  our accounts receivable and our debt would have been about million higher at december  and million higher at december  all such receivables sold during were sold without recourse  and no amount of accounts receivable sold remained on the consolidated balance sheet at december  we use cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations  and funds available under the revolving facility subject to continued compliance with the financial covenants and representations under the revolving facility as our primary sources of liquidity 
the revolving facility provides for maximum borrowings of up to million and  subject to certain conditions including a maximum senior secured leverage ratio test  an accordion feature that permits graftech finance to establish additional credit facilities thereunder in an aggregate amount  together with the revolving facility  of up to million 
at december   although there were no amounts drawn from the facility  million was available after consideration of outstanding letters of credit of million 
it is possible that our future ability to borrow under the revolving facility may effectively be less because of the impact of additional borrowings upon our compliance with the maximum net senior secured debt leverage ratio permitted or minimum interest coverage ratio required under the revolving facility 
we believe that our business strategies will continue to improve the amount and speed of cash generated from operations under current economic conditions 
improvements in cash flow from operations resulting from these strategies are being partially offset by associated cash implementation costs while they are being implemented 
we also believe that our planned asset sales together with these improvements in cash flow from operations should allow us to reduce our debt and other obligations over the long term 
at december   we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants contained in the senior notes  the debentures and the revolving facility  as applicable 
based on expected operating results and expected cash flows  we expect to be in compliance with these covenants over the next twelve months 
if we were to believe that we would not continue to comply with these covenants  we would seek an appropriate waiver or amendment from the lenders thereunder 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such waiver or amendment on acceptable terms or at all 
at december   all of our debt consists of fixed rate obligations 
at december   the revolving facility had an effective interest rate of  our million principal amount of senior notes had a fixed rate of and our million principal amount of debentures had a fixed rate of 
we estimate interest expense to be approximately million for

pursuant to this contract  cgi became the delivery arm for our global information services 
under the outsourcing provisions of this contract  cgi managed our data center services  networks  desktops  telecommunications and legacy systems 
this contract was amended  effective september  to reduce the scope of cgi s management of our data center services  networks  desktops and telecommunications 
we are dependent on cgi for these services 
a failure by cgi to provide any of these services to us in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on our results of operations

the total amount available under the lines of credit amounted to million at december  
table of contents cash flow and plans to manage liquidity 
as a result of our significant leverage and other substantial obligations  our business strategies include efforts to enhance our capital structure by further reducing our gross obligations 
further  we have placed the highest priority on accelerating the amount and speed of cash generated every day 
our efforts include leveraging our unique global manufacturing network by driving higher utilization rates and more productivity from our existing assets  accelerating commercialization initiatives across all of our businesses and realizing other global efficiencies 
in addition  we may continue to exchange or repurchase senior notes or debentures as described below 
we also continue to evaluate other opportunities to reduce our obligations  including the obligations associated with our us defined benefit plan  which was frozen in typically  our cash flow from operations fluctuates significantly between quarters due to various factors 
these factors include customer order patterns  fluctuations in working capital requirements  and other factors 
in  we had negative cash flow from operations primarily due to payments in connection with restructurings  antitrust investigations  lawsuits and claims and uses of cash from working capital 
in  we had positive cash flow from operations despite continued payments in connection with restructurings and antitrust investigations and the continued use of cash for working capital to  among other things  build inventories 
in  we had positive cash flow from operations primarily from decreases in working capital and improved operating results 
we expect cash flow from operations to be positively impacted by the completion of our fines and penalties related to the antitrust and related lawsuits in the first quarter  reduced interest expense of about million related to our reduced senior note obligations  decreases in cash outlay for planned overhead cost reductions 
we expect our cash flow from operations to be negatively impacted by higher raw material prices  higher accounts receivable balances as a result of increased prices for graphite electrodes  increased taxes paid as a result of the sale of the cathodes business in and the realization of certain international deferred taxes  an incentive compensation payout in the second quarter  planned pension and post retirement contributions  and payments for severance under restructuring plans and workforce rationalization initiatives 
we also expect to generate cash from our planned divestitures of assets and property  including our planned sale of our vyazma  russia interest and land in caserta  italy 
our cash flow will also be impacted from the loss of working capital and capital expenditures related to our former cathodes business  which was sold in the fourth quarter of our high leverage and other substantial obligations could have a material impact on our liquidity 
cash flow from operations services payment of our debt and other obligations  including our incentive compensation program payout in the second quarter of  thereby reducing funds available to us for other purposes 
our leverage and these obligations make us more vulnerable to economic downturns in the event that these obligations are greater or timing of payment is sooner than expected 
based on expected operating results and expected cash flows  we expect to be in compliance with financial covenants in in order to seek to minimize our credit risks  we reduced our sales of  or refused to sell except for cash on delivery  graphite electrodes to some customers and potential customers in the us and  to a limited extent  elsewhere 
our unrecovered trade receivables worldwide were only of global net sales during the last years 
we cannot assure you that we will not be materially adversely affected by accounts receivable losses in the future 
in addition  we have historically factored a portion of our accounts receivable and used the proceeds to reduce debt 
we may from time to time and at any time repurchase senior notes or debentures in open market or privately negotiated transactions  opportunistically on terms that we believe to be favorable 
in february  we redeemed million of our senior notes using proceeds from the sale of our cathode business 
we plan to redeem an additional million in march of these purchases may be effected for cash from cash and cash equivalents  borrowings under the revolving facility or new credit facilities  or proceeds from sale of debt or 
table of contents equity securities or assets  in exchange for common stock or other equity or debt securities  or a combination thereof 
we will evaluate any such transaction in light of then prevailing market conditions and our then current and prospective liquidity and capital resources  including projected and potential needs and prospects for access to capital markets 
any such transactions may  individually or in the aggregate  be material 
related party transactions 
since january   we have not engaged in or been a party to any material transactions with affiliates or related parties other than transactions with our current or former subsidiaries including carbone savoie and aet and compensatory transactions with directors and officers including employee benefits  stock option and restricted stock grants  compensation deferral  executive employee loans and stock purchases 
off balance sheet arrangements and commitments

table of contents costs relating to protection of the environment we have been and are subject to increasingly stringent environmental protection laws and regulations 
in addition  we have an on going commitment to rigorous internal environmental protection standards 
environmental considerations are part of all significant capital expenditure decisions 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding environmental expenses and capital expenditures 
for the year ended december  dollars in thousands expenses relating to environmental protection capital expenditures related to environmental protection critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that require difficult  subjective or complex judgments by management  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following accounting policies are deemed to be critical 
reliance on estimates 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  we use and rely on estimates in determining the economic useful lives of our assets  obligations under our employee benefit plans  provisions for doubtful accounts  provisions for restructuring charges and contingencies  tax valuation allowances  evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets  pension and postretirement benefit obligations and various other recorded or disclosed amounts 
estimates require us to use our judgment 
while we believe that our estimates for these matters are reasonable  if the actual amount is significantly different than the estimated amount  our assets  liabilities or results of operations may be overstated or understated 
employee benefit plans 
we sponsor various retirement and pension plans  including defined benefit and defined contribution plans and postretirement benefit plans that cover most employees worldwide 
accounting for these plans requires assumptions as to the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  expected salary increases and health care cost trend rate 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
contingencies 
we account for contingencies by recording an estimated loss or gain from a loss or gain contingency when information available prior to issuance of the consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred or a gain has become receivable at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of the loss or gain can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies such as those relating to environmental  legal and income tax matters requires us to use our judgment 
while we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate  if the actual loss or gain from a contingency is significantly different from the estimated loss or gain  our results of operations may be overstated or understated 
legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency are expensed as incurred 

table of contents impairments of long lived assets 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the future undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated future undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by the asset 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell 
estimates of the future cash flows are subject to significant uncertainties and assumptions 
if the actual value is significantly less than the estimated fair value  our assets may be overstated 
future events and circumstances  some of which are described below  may result in an impairment charge new technological developments that provide significantly enhanced benefits over our current technology  significant negative economic or industry trends  changes in our business strategy that alter the expected usage of the related assets  and future economic results that are below our expectations used in the current assessments 
accounting for income taxes 
when we prepare the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires us to make the following assessments estimate our actual current tax liability in each jurisdiction  estimate our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as lease revenue and related depreciation  for tax and accounting purposes which result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that we include within the consolidated balance sheets  and assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  if we believe that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance is established 
if our estimates are incorrect  our deferred tax assets or liabilities may be overstated or understated 
revenue recognition 
in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue from sales of our products is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  title has passed  the amount is determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
product warranty claims and returns are estimated and recorded as a reduction to revenue 
volume discounts and rebates are recorded as a reduction of revenue in conjunction with the sale of the related products 
changes to estimates are recorded when they become probable 
shipping and handling revenues relating to products sold are included as an increase to revenue 
shipping and handling costs related to products sold are included as an increase to cost of sales

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in currency exchange rates and commercial energy rates 
we may from time to time enter into various transactions that have been authorized according to documented policies and procedures to manage these well defined risks 
these transactions relate primarily to financial instruments described below 
since the counterparties  if any  to these financial instruments are large commercial banks and similar financial institutions  we do not believe that we are exposed to material counterparty credit risk 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes 
our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates results primarily from sales made by our subsidiaries in currencies other than local currencies  raw material purchases made by our foreign subsidiaries in currencies other than local currencies  and investments in and intercompany loans to our foreign subsidiaries and our share of the earnings of those subsidiaries  to the extent denominated in currencies other than the dollar 
our exposure to changes in energy costs results primarily from the purchase of natural gas and electricity for use in our manufacturing operations 
currency rate management 
we enter into foreign currency instruments to attempt to manage exposure to changes in currency exchange rates 
these foreign currency instruments  which include  but are not limited to  forward exchange contracts and purchased currency options  attempt to hedge global currency exposures  net  relating to euro denominated debt and identifiable foreign currency receivables  payables and commitments held by our foreign and domestic subsidiaries 
forward exchange contracts are agreements to exchange different currencies at a specified future date and at a specified rate 
purchased foreign currency options are instruments  which give the holder the right  but not the obligation  to exchange different currencies at a specified rate at a specified date or over a range of specified dates 
the result is the creation of a range in which a best and worst price is defined  while minimizing option cost 
forward exchange contracts and purchased currency options are carried at market value 
in  one contract expired and we sold all remaining open foreign exchange contracts 
during  we entered into two contracts to minimize foreign currency exposure against the euro 
both contracts expired in as a result  at december  and december   respectively  we had no such contracts outstanding 
gains and losses associated with these contracts amounted to a loss of million in  a gain of million in  and a loss of million in commercial energy rate management 
we have in the past entered into  and may in the future enter into  natural gas derivative contracts and short duration fixed rate purchase contracts to effectively fix some or all of our natural gas cost exposure 
the outstanding contracts at december  were a payable of million 
sensitivity analysis 
we used a sensitivity analysis to assess the potential effect of changes in currency exchange rates on gross margin and changes in interest rates on interest expense 
based on this analysis  a hypothetical weakening or strengthening in the dollar across all other currencies would have changed our reported gross margin for by about million 
based on this analysis  a hypothetical increase in interest rates of basis points would have increased our interest expense by about million for
