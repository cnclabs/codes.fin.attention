summary smithtown bancorp  inc  is a holding company formed in  engaged primarily in commercial banking through its wholly owned subsidiary  bank of smithtown 
the bank offers a full array of consumer and commercial deposit and lending products and services through its fifteen branch offices and its online banking site 
the bank also provides insurance and financial products through its two wholly owned subsidiaries  bank of smithtown insurance agents and brokers  inc and bank of smithtown financial services  inc 
for the following discussion  the consolidated entity is referred to as the company and the bank and its subsidiaries are referred to as the bank 
there were several significant factors that affected the company s financial condition and results of operations during the discussion of these factors should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements 
the growth in assets and net income experienced by the company over the past twelve years has continued into the company s earnings per share for were as compared to for  an increase of 
as the weighted average number of outstanding shares only decreased by  shares from to  this increase in earnings per share is almost exclusively the result of increased net income 
assets reached  this year  an increase of over the growth in earnings was primarily the result of an increased loan volume of  or 
the quarterly growth of loan balances during was relatively stable  with the exception of third quarter during which growth was slowed due to the timing of scheduled loan closings 
higher growth levels resumed after summer s end 
the largest increase in loan volume was again in the real estate sector with residential loans achieving growth 
construction loan funding also increased  by  a deliberate slowing from the growth rate during due to the short term nature of construction loans  originations required to sustain such high growth are nearly triple the net growth 
construction projects are typically completed in a nine to twelve month period  at which point the loan is paid and permanent financing is required 
a shift into more of this permanent type financing was planned and achieved for the company s results of operations can be significantly affected by general economic conditions  particularly its ability to increase loan volume through construction lending if market interest rates were to continue rising 
as this segment of the bank s loan portfolio must be replaced every nine to twelve months  if the construction industry were to slow due to rising interest rates  bank originations could be significantly reduced 
in order to mitigate this risk  the bank began increasing its volume of longer term  permanent real estate financing 
the highly competitive nature of this business is another significant factor that could potentially affect the company s results of operations 
as a lower rate of interest may need to be accepted for this type of credit due to strong competitive bidding  the bank s net interest margin could be further reduced 
during  the bank s margin decreased from to 
this decline in margin was sustained during the first quarter of  and was totally a result of increased interest expense on deposit accounts as well as on outstanding borrowings 
each quarter thereafter  net interest margin fluctuated only slightly  indicative of the increasing competitive pressures for deposit acquisition evidenced this past year 
overall  the four rate increases effected during the first half of were beneficial to the bank s increasing loan volume  as the average monthly yield on the portfolio increased from in january to in december of the bank s loan portfolio is comprised of of immediately repriceable loans tied to the wall street journal prime rate 
of the company s real estate portfolio is adjustable and tied to various us treasury note rates 
therefore an upward shift in market rates has an immediate positive effect on most loan yields 
average yield on loans for the year was during as compared to during significant loan growth was achieved during with no compromise to underwriting standards or asset quality 
at year end  nonperforming loans amounted to only the one loan which was discussed in last year s k and quarterly q reports  a leasehold mortgage on a property located on madison avenue in new york city  became a nonaccrual loan during the third quarter of  and was subsequently written down to its net realizable value and moved into other real estate in december no further writedowns are presently anticipated for this property and its sale is expected during during  the positive impact on earnings from the growth in the loan portfolio was partially due to the bank s ability to provide most of the funding for these loans through internally generated deposits 
although deposit costs did increase during  the expense was always lower than that of comparable wholesale borrowings 
these borrowings were required early in as the bank ran various time deposit promotions throughout the first quarter of the year and these new deposits flowed into the bank  these wholesale funds were no longer required 
as loan growth was very strong during the fourth quarter of  but typical year end deposit runoff also occurred  the bank turned to the wholesale market once again to temporarily bridge the gap between loans and deposits 
the level of overnight borrowings was minimal and amounted to  on the last day of the year 
as funds from matured investment securities and one large loan payoff flowed into the bank after business hours on december   federal fund sales of over million dollars was actually resumed on january  during deposits grew by  or 
the bank was able to achieve this growth through various channels  one of which was through its newest branch offices 
 of this total growth was originated at the company s five newest locations 
deposit growth  similar to loan growth  is also affected by external interest rate movements and strong competitive pressures 
both of these factors played an important role in the company s results of operations during of the total deposit growth of  demand deposits grew by only  or 
in spite of this small growth  the increase was higher than the that was achieved during competitive pressures for a commodity product have been and remain extremely strong 
free checking is commonplace to all banks  and the movement of a consumer checking account from one institution to another is one of the more difficult challenges facing banks that want to grow deposits today 
money market accounts grew by  or and time deposits by  or 
now accounts and savings accounts increased in volume by  or 
the bank ran several time deposit promotions  and advertised frequently for money market and savings accounts during the year in an effort to provide a majority of the funding for its loan growth 
the introduction of the premium savings account took place during february and resulted in putting an end to the runoff of savings balances that was experienced in  and added  of new deposits 
although most new interest bearing deposits that were acquired during caused compression in the bank s interest margin  management was still able to provide this funding at rates lower than comparable term federal home loan bank advance rates  and thus was able to minimize margin compression 
witnessed increasing liquidity demands by customers who were uncertain as to the future direction of interest rates  and as such  short term certificates of deposit were most attractive to them 
the often inverted yield curve made it difficult for the company to earn any spread on traditional bank investment products  therefore a high level of long term investment securities were not added during in fact  a majority of investment maturities were rechanneled into higher yielding loans  and during the third quarter  sales of lower yielding securities were transacted in order to achieve higher yields in new loan originations 
with economic conditions still remaining positive in both the long island and metropolitan area marketplace  and the building industry expected to rebound on long island and continue to prosper in new york city  the company s outlook for continued asset growth is positive 
the liability side of the balance sheet  particularly the sources for funding for this asset growth  remains the company s greatest challenge 
as previously discussed  the bank s investment portfolio decreased in size during security purchases during the year amounted to  and were primarily in the us government agency and municipal portfolios 
these new investment securities had a weighted average yield of and a weighted average maturity of years 
during the year  matured and called securities of  reduced the size of the portfolio 
although the interest income generated by investment securities is often lower than that of loans  these securities are held by the bank for liquidity purposes and also to provide the bank with the collateral necessary for acceptance of local municipal deposits 
during february  the bank successfully completed the formation of bos preferred funding corp  a real estate investment trust 
this subsidiary was formed to hold a portion of the bank s consumer and commercial real estate loans 
as a result of new york state tax laws  of the dividends received by the bank from this subsidiary are excludable from taxable income 
this tax savings amounted to over one million dollars during was another successful year for the company  with record earnings for the twelfth consecutive year 
return on equity was  the tenth consecutive year for a return to stockholders of over 
however  significant challenges lie ahead for the company 
growth in deposits  particularly demand deposits  will remain difficult 
with slower demand deposit growth  most of which is in free checking accounts  maintaining fee income from service charges becomes difficult 
interest bearing deposit acquisition  while not as difficult to achieve as demand deposit acquisition  can place extreme pressure on net interest margin 
based on the uncertainty of actions to be advocated by the new federal reserve chairman during  any further rate increases could have a material impact on the cost for these deposits 
as longer term borrowings mature during the coming years  the rates at which they are renewed could be significantly higher than the current rates paid 
the current weighted average rate on all long term borrowings from the federal home loan bank is with a weighted average term of seventeen months 
replacing this funding with similar term funding could increase interest expense by one hundred and fifty basis points 
this uncertainty in forward interest rates  as well as the unusual yield curve  place additional pressures on net income 
the company continues to meet these challenges in various ways  one of which is by expanding its franchise 
one new branch office in bohemia was opened during  and the company s fifteenth branch office in coram actually opened for business on january  plans for the opening of two additional branch offices in plus two new offices in continue to increase the geographical footprint of the company 
development of new products and or addition of product lines to increase fee income also assist in maintaining strong earnings despite the preponderance of free checking 
the overdraft honor program continued to be very successful toward this effort during this product provides the consumer with coverage of overdrafts up to a predetermined level  yet provides the bank with significant dollars of new fee income 
additional revenue from bank of smithtown insurance agents and brokers  inc provides another source of increased fee income 
net revenues from the agency increased this year over by 
future challenges to be faced by the company will also continue to be met through strong asset liability management  with interest rate modeling and other analytical tools to ensure profit maximization within acceptable limits of risk 
application of critical accounting policies in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported asset and liability balances and revenue and expense amounts 
our determination of the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate because it is based on our subjective evaluation of a variety of factors at a specific point in time and involves difficult and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
in the event that management s estimate needs to be adjusted based on  among other things  additional information that comes to light after the estimate is made or changes in circumstances  such adjustment could result in the need for a significantly different allowance for loan losses and thereby materially impact  either positively or negatively  the bank s results of operations 
the allowance for loan losses is established and maintained through a provision for loan losses based on probable incurred losses inherent in the bank s loan portfolio 
management  through its asset quality committee  comprised of several members of executive management as well as the chief collection officer  evaluates the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis 
adjustments are made at this time to a level deemed adequate by the committee  based on its risk evaluation of the portfolio in its entirety as well as in specific loan details 
the allowance is comprised of both individual valuation allowances and loan pool valuation allowances 
the bank monitors its entire loan portfolio on a regular basis  with consideration given to detailed analysis of classified loans  repayment patterns  probable incurred losses  past loss experience  current economic conditions and various types of concentrations of credit 
additions to the allowance are charged to expense and realized losses  net of recoveries  are charged to the allowance 
individual valuation allowances are established in connection with specific loan reviews and the asset classification process  including the procedures for impairment testing under statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  an amendment of sfas statements no 
and  and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures  an amendment of sfas statement no 
such valuation  which includes a review of loans for which full collectibility in accordance with contractual terms is not reasonably assured  considers the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less the costs to sell  if any  or the present value of expected future cash flows  or the loan s observable market value 
any shortfall that exists from this analysis results in a specific allowance for the loan 
pursuant to our policy  loan losses must be charged off in the period the loans  or portions thereof  are deemed uncollectible 
assumptions and judgments by management  in conjunction with outside sources  are used to determine whether full collectibility of a loan is not reasonably assured 
assumptions and judgments also are used to determine the estimates of the fair value of the underlying collateral or the present value of expected future cash flows or the loan s observable market value 
individual valuation allowances could differ materially as a result of changes in these assumptions and judgments 
individual loan analyses are periodically performed on specific loans considered impaired 
the results of the individual valuation allowances are aggregated and included in the overall allowance for loan losses 
in addition to estimating losses for loans individually deemed to be impaired  management also estimates collective impairment losses for pools of loans that are not specifically reviewed 
statistical information regarding the bank s historical loss experience over a period of time believed to be relevant is weighted very heavily in management s estimate of such losses 
however  future losses could vary significantly from those experienced in the past 
in addition  management also considers a variety of general qualitative factors and then subjectively determines the amount of weight to assign to each in estimating losses 
the factors include  among others  national and local economic conditions  environmental risks  trends in volume and terms of loans  concentrations of credit  changes in lending policies and procedures  and experience  ability  and depth of the bank s lending staff 
because of the nature of the factors and the difficulty in assessing their impact  management s resulting estimate of losses may not accurately reflect actual losses in the portfolio 
although the allowance for loan losses has two separate components  one for impairment losses on individual loans and one for collective impairment losses on pools of loans  the entire allowance for loan losses is available to absorb realized losses as they occur whether they relate to individual loans or pools of loans 
at december   management believed the allowance for loan losses had been established and maintained at a level adequate to reflect the probable incurred losses in the bank s loan portfolio 
liquidity the objective of liquidity management is to ensure the sufficiency of funds available to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers and to access unanticipated earnings enhancement opportunities for company growth 
liquidity management addresses the ability to meet deposit withdrawals either on demand or contractual maturity  to repay other borrowings as they mature and to make new loans and investments as opportunities arise 
the company s principal source of liquidity is dividends from the bank 
due to regulatory restrictions  dividends from the bank to the company at december  were limited to  which represented the bank s net income and the net retained earnings from the previous two years 
the dividends received from the bank are used primarily for dividends to the stockholders  and also for interest payments on the subordinated debt 
in the event that the company subsequently expands its current operations  in addition to dividends from the bank  it will need to rely on its own earnings  additional capital raised and other borrowings to meet liquidity needs 
the bank s most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents  securities available for sale and securities held to maturity due within one year 
the levels of these assets are dependent upon the bank s operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
other sources of liquidity include loan and security principal repayments and maturities  lines of credit with other financial institutions including the federal home loan bank  and growth in core deposits 
while scheduled loan amortization  maturing securities and short term investments are relatively predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan and mortgage backed securities prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the bank adjusts its liquidity levels as appropriate to meet funding needs such as seasonal deposit outflows  loans  and asset and liability management objectives 
the goal of asset liability management is the combination of maintaining adequate liquidity levels without sacrificing earnings 
the bank s objective in asset liability management is to match the maturity of its assets and liabilities in a way that takes advantage of the current and anticipated rate environment 
asset liability management is a primary function of management and is reviewed on an ongoing basis 
the chief executive officer  all executive vice presidents  the vice president of retail  the comptroller and the vice president for financial reporting serve on the asset liability management committee 
historically  the bank has relied on its deposit base as its principal source of funding 
however  in recent years  various sources of funding have become available to the bank in increasing magnitudes 
these additional sources may be more attractive to the bank at different times based on market interest rates and other competitive factors 
management views all sources of funding as acceptable and makes decisions as to which sources are more advantageous at the time of need 
the discriminate use of different sources of funding at different points in time has contributed to higher interest margins and overall net income for the bank during and at december  the bank had the ability to borrow on aggregate  unsecured lines of credit of  with unaffiliated correspondent banks 
none of this credit was outstanding at year end  and therefore all  was available for use 
the bank has the ability  as a member of the federal home loan bank fhlb system  to borrow against unencumbered residential and commercial mortgages owned by the bank 
at december    of these funds was available yet for borrowing 
the following table represents management s expectations regarding the estimated cash flow of interest bearing assets and liabilities as of december  this table has been derived based on internal data and management s assumptions  and not necessarily the contractual terms for repayment or redemption 
the amounts shown below could also be significantly affected by external factors such as changes in prepayment assumptions  changes in market interest rates that are not matched by the company  early withdrawals of deposits and competition 
therefore  this information does not reflect the effect of repricing rights or the impact of repricing on interest income or expense 
the following significant assumptions were used in developing the following tables a time deposits reflect contractual maturities  b money market accounts are rate sensitive and accordingly  all accounts have been included as withdrawable within the first two years and c savings and now accounts are not as rate sensitive to withdrawal as money market accounts  therefore a significant percentage of these accounts are reflected in the more than to years category 
these assumptions are based on management s historical analysis of market interest rates and levels of the company s deposits over the past ten years

analysis of net interest income vs 
net interest income  the primary contributor to earnings  represents the difference between income on interest earning assets and expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income depends upon the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on them 
as has been discussed in prior sections  the bank s net interest margin decreased by fifteen basis points during  resulting primarily from the increased cost of time deposits and money market accounts  as well as borrowings 
however  the bank has been able to take advantage of the increasing interest rate environment by repricing its loan portfolio to higher rates 
of the bank s loan portfolio is immediately repriceable and tied to the wall street journal prime rate 
an additional of the loan portfolio is adjustable and tied to various us treasury note rates 
the upward repricing of these loans has mitigated the pressure placed on margin by the higher cost of interest bearing deposits 
the following table sets forth certain information relating to the company s average consolidated statements of financial condition and its consolidated statements of income for the years indicated and reflects the average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for the years indicated

rate volume analysis net interest income can be analyzed in terms of the impact of changes in rates and volumes 
the following table illustrates the extent to which changes in interest rates and in volume of average interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected the bank s interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated 
information is provided in each category with respect to changes attributable to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior rate  changes attributable to changes in rate changes in rates multiplied by prior volume  and the net changes 
for purposes of this table  changes  which are not due solely to volume or rate changes  have been allocated to these categories based on the respective percentage changes in average volume and rate

for vs 
net interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  increased by  or  from to as can be seen from the above table  this was due to a combination of an increased volume variance of  and a decreased rate variance of variances in volume during  the average volume of investment securities increased by  although year end balances were lower in than this was due to a majority of maturities and calls occurring during the last six months of the year 
most investment maturities were channeled into new loan originations to take advantage of higher yields 
of the  in new investment purchases   were in us government agency obligations  with the remainder in municipal obligations and other equity securities 
the largest growth in average balance during was in the loan portfolio 
this increase amounted to  of which real estate loans increased by the highest percentage 
within the real estate portfolio  the greatest increase in average balances was in land and construction loans which increased in average volume by over million dollars or 
the next largest area of growth was in residential and commercial mortgages which grew in average volume by 
federal funds balances declined from to as most deposit inflows were either deployed into new loans or new investment securities 
on the liability side of the balance sheet  during  average interest bearing deposit volumes increased by almost the same amount as loan balances  and this increase totaled  the greatest percentage increase within the deposit portfolio was in time deposits which grew in average balance by  or 
the company ran several time deposit promotions during the year in an effort to collect the deposits required to fund new loan originations 
the promotions were very successful in attracting new deposits which were less costly to the bank than comparable term federal home loan bank advances 
the elite money market product was also quite successful in adding new balances to the bank s deposit portfolio  and this addition amounted to  in average balances equating to a increase 
the company s newest branch offices made large strides toward increasing overall deposit balances during  with approximately of all new money attributable to these newest locations 
the average balance of the company s subordinated debt increased during the year from  to  as a result of a  trust preferred issuance in march the funds obtained from this issuance were quickly deployed into new loan fundings 
demand deposits increased in average balance by  the growth in average balance for stockholders equity during was  or resulting primarily from the  of net income 
this strong net income level in combination with the growth in stockholders equity resulted in a return on average equity of 
variances in rate the average rate earned during on interest earning assets increased by basis points from in to in loans were primarily responsible for this increase 
the average rate received on loans in was as compared to in this is a result of the large volume of immediately repriceable loans within the bank s portfolio 
as market rates change  so do the rates on these loans 
the investment portfolio increased in average rate by basis points year over year  due to the purchase of slightly higher yielding securities 
on the liability side of the balance sheet  the cost of deposits increased substantially  by  as market rates increased and competitive pressures heightened throughout the year 
although the company manages rates paid on its deposits carefully  customers have become more sophisticated rate shoppers 
the use of the internet for obtaining competitive rates is widely used 
a customer s choice of where to place available funds has grown substantially  and has resulted in an increasingly competitive rate environment  with higher rate offerings now affecting all financial institutions 
this trend is likely to continue 
resulting net interest margin for was fifteen basis points lower than in  but still remains the bank s primary source of net income 
for vs 
net interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  increased by  or from to as can be seen from the above table  this was due to a combination of an increased volume variance of  and increased interest rate variance of  variances in volume during  the average volume of investment securities increased by  as excess funds collected early in the year were employed in securities yielding a higher rate of interest than federal funds 
a majority of these new securities were us government agency securities with maturities of less than five years 
the largest increase in the company s balance sheet was in the loan portfolio 
this average balance increased from to by  within the loan portfolio  the greatest increase was in real estate loans  which grew by over  in average balances 
within the real estate portfolio  loans to finance land acquisition and construction loans increased by the greatest percentage 
commercial mortgages decreased slightly in volume due to refinancing activity  limitations placed upon the bank relative to legal lending limits  and to intense competitive pricing pressures 
on the liability side of the balance sheet  average interest bearing deposit volume increased by  or 
the greatest increase within deposit balances was in time deposits 
the bank ran several certificate of deposit promotions throughout the year  at rates lower than comparable federal home loan bank advance rates  and was very successful in attracting new customers 
these accounts  as well as elite money market accounts  were the primary drivers of deposit acquisition during the addition of three new branch offices also significantly increased the breadth of the bank s customer base 
the average balance increase in demand deposits for was  or 
while not as strong an increase as management would like to have seen for the year  demand deposit acquisition and retention become a priority goal during the bank s use of borrowed funds  primarily in the form of term advances from the federal home loan bank  increased during by  twenty million dollars of borrowings were originated during the last two months of  as the pricing of interest bearing deposits was very high 
at that point in time  management made the decision to turn to the wholesale markets for loan funding rather than pay the higher rates on deposit accounts 
these additional borrowings at year end were responsible for the increased average balances of throughout the majority of the bank relied on its own internal deposit generation to fund new loan originations 
stockholders equity increased during as a result of strong earnings  and this growth resulted in a very strong return on average equity of 
variances in rate the increase in short term interest rates resulting from eight federal reserve bank rate increases during was responsible for the upward movement in rate variance 
a majority of the bank s loan portfolio is adjustable with indexed to the prime rate 
these immediately repriceable loans were in large part responsible for the increase in yield of basis points on the portfolio during investment yields did not fare as well  as new purchases added to the portfolio carried lower yields than currently held securities 
these new purchases were predominantly short term issues  as term extension carried no benefit in the flat yield curve environment of the average yield on federal funds sold increased by basis points over the corresponding yield in this large increase in average yield in combination with a smaller increase in average balances produced a increase in income 
overall  the yield on interest earning assets increased by during costs for deposits also increased  with the largest increase in interest on money market accounts 
this was due to the elite money market account which bears a high rate of interest for balances of  or more 
the product was very successful in attracting additional deposits 
although there was some migration from lower paying money market accounts and savings accounts  overall the balances raised from the product were new funds to the bank  and were lower cost than overnight borrowings and short term advances 
the increase in average cost of deposit accounts was basis points from to the average rate on borrowings also increased during by basis points 
the addition of four advances from the federal home loan bank totaling twenty million dollars at year end was responsible for this increase 
the total increase in interest expense for the company s subordinated debt was due to the increase in average rate 
this increase amounted to basis points for the year over the total effect of the increases in average rates and volumes during was increased net interest income and slightly decreased net interest margin  due primarily to the significant growth in the bank s loan portfolio 
loans the bank s loan portfolio consists primarily of real estate loans secured by residential and commercial properties located within the bank s market area as well as within the five boroughs of new york city 
loan growth remained strong during the portfolio grew by  over the level  representing an increase of 
the largest area of growth during was in residential loans 
residential loans consist of loans to customers for residential home purchases  both first and second liens  revolving  open end loans secured by one to four family residential properties and extended under lines of credit  as well as secured by multifamily residential properties 
within the residential loan portfolio  the increases were highest in the multifamily and closed end one to four family segments 
the second largest area of growth in the portfolio was in the construction and land development loans sector 
these loans are typically of a short term nature  and provide the interim financing needs of builders during the construction stages of their project 
these two segments of the bank s loan portfolio grew in total by  or 
real estate lending continued to be the bank s primary focus and strength for and will be for the coming year 
this can be seen from the segmentation of the portfolio which remained stable from to  with real estate loans comprising and  respectively 
the bank s experience as to strong performance  low delinquencies  and minimal charge offs provide the basis for continuation in real estate lending 
concentration risk is mitigated by geographical and industry diversification  as well as sound  conservative underwriting standards and periodic internal loan stratification review as well as credit review performed by a former regulatory examiner

analysis of the allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses at december  and was  and  the change in the allowance account is comprised of net charge offs of and a provision for loan losses of  based on specific reserves for internally classified loans and multiple factors including historical experience and current economic conditions  management feels the level of the allowance for loan losses provides adequate coverage 
currently  the bank s reserve ratio the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of end of period loans is

management believes this level of reserves is adequate due to the quality of the portfolio and is within the range of peer group banks 
the allowance for loan losses is an amount that management currently believes will be adequate to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in the bank s loan portfolio 
in determining the allowance for loan losses  there is not an exact amount but rather a range for what constitutes an appropriate allowance 
as more fully discussed in the application of critical accounting policies section of this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the process for estimating credit losses and determining the allowance for loan losses as of any balance sheet date is subjective in nature and requires material estimates 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates

the portion of the loan loss allowance allocated to each loan category does not represent the total available for future losses which may occur within the loan category since the total loan loss allowance is a valuation allocation applicable to the entire loan portfolio 
the level of unallocated reserves was arrived at after an in depth analysis of the unique characteristics of the company s portfolio 
factors such as the high growth rate of the portfolio over the past several years  the historical performance of the portfolio including delinquencies  net charge off ratios and the level of nonperforming loans have been considered in determining the level of unallocated reserves 
additional factors including local economic conditions  loan concentrations  and experience level of lending staff all contribute to the final determination of the unallocated portion of the allowance

the primary effect of inflation on the operations of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates have a more significant effect on the performance of a financial institution than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and changes in prices 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors which are beyond the control of the company  including the influence of domestic and foreign economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government and federal agencies  particularly the federal reserve board 
recent accounting pronouncements for a discussion regarding the impact of new accounting standards  refer to note a of notes to consolidated financial statements 
noninterest income  noninterest expense and income taxes for vs 
total noninterest income increased year over year by  or 
this growth was attributable to various sources including trust and investment services  revenues from the bank s insurance agency  gains on sales of investment securities and gains on bank owned life insurance 
fee income generated from fiduciary and investment services provided by the bank s trust and investment services division increased by over income from trust and estate commissions totaled and fees from investment management and custodial accounts totaled fees in the trust and investment services division were higher than primarily due to the final commissions received from the closure of three trust accounts and an estate account 
these fees represent one time commissions and are not recognized until the accounts are closed and in the case of an estate account  the estate is settled 
during  total new assets under management from outside sources and from assets distributed from trusts and retained within the trust division totaled  plans have begun in for combining the trust and investment services division with bank of smithtown financial services inc 
the two divisions share some common services  but often have dissimilar customer profiles 
as these customers proceed through their life cycles  they often use different services offered by the two divisions at different points in time 
combining the two segments of business will provide synergies and convenient referral business for both divisions 
gross revenues from the bank s insurance agency also increased during over  by 
net income derived from the agency increased by 
this increase was due primarily to unplanned commission income received from insurance carriers 
was the second full year of operation for the agency under the bank s management 
synergies between the bank and agency continue to grow  with resultant expense reductions and referral income growth 
plans for additional cost reductions are underway  with increased net income projections for the agency for the gain on the sale of investment securities increased noninterest income by this gain resulted from the sale of  of municipal and mortgage backed securities 
the three sold securities had maturity dates beyond twenty years 
the sale was transacted in order to replace lower yielding securities on the balance sheet with higher yielding loans 
it is not the intent of management to trade securities within its portfolio  and therefore most investments are held to maturity or call date 
miscellaneous fee income also increased by during over the majority of this income came from various new commercial services offered by the bank out of its newest branch locations 
there were small declines in service charge income during that were the result of free checking accounts 
although these service charges declined  the fee income received from the overdraft honor program continued at its pace  providing substantial fee income in addition to regular overdraft fees 
the gain in cash value of bank owned life insurance declined by during this life insurance was purchased to provide the funding for various benefit plans provided by the bank such as group term life insurance  director and executive incentive retirement plans and a supplemental executive retirement agreement for the chief executive officer 
during   of policies were transferred through a exchange to a different insurance carrier from general account to separate account policies 
due diligence was conducted on the new carrier and various benefits associated with separate account policies will be recognized during  one of which is a higher rate of return to the bank 
total noninterest expense increased by during over the common thread between all of the components of this increased expense was the company s growth 
the construction of new branch offices in combination with renovations of older  existing offices has increased occupancy expense and furniture and equipment expense by over in depreciation expense on leasehold and building improvements as well as computer equipment increased by or over levels 
office rental expense increased by or over costs 
the expense for computer equipment increased by or 
all of these costs reflect the expenses associated with the new style  brand defining branch offices for which bank of smithtown has been widely recognized 
the last eight branch offices have been built in the style of customer centric design  with open spaces for universal bankers to serve customers  with areas set aside for viewing the latest financial news as well as bank products and services  and segregated areas for private customer and banker discussions with laptop computers 
gourmet coffee bars add a relaxing atmosphere for conversing between customers and bankers 
results obtained from these new style branches have been the subject of many local and national newspapers and magazines 
salary and benefit expenses have also risen from to by and  respectively 
these higher levels of expenses have resulted from increased staffing requirements as well as ordinary year over year increases 
other significant increased noninterest expense items included legal fees and audit and accounting fees 
these costs increased by in total  or 
these were the primary expenses associated with the formation of bos preferred funding corp 
during  and the associated benefit received by the company far outweighed the set up costs 
for and years thereafter  there will be annual administration and tax service costs  significantly reduced from first year implementation costs 
another material expense included in the noninterest expense category is the amortization of intangible assets  which increased from to in this increase was due to the timing of additional installment payments made to the prior owners of the seigerman mulvey insurance agency during as part of the contractual purchase agreement and due to applying an accelerated method of amortization 
the final payment for the agency will be made in the expenses related to electronic banking including online banking  atm processing and debit card costs have increased dramatically during this was the result of increased interchange costs  website changes and activity charges related to the processing of atm and debit card transactions 
the volume of these transactions has increased tremendously throughout the past year 
the number of debit card transactions has rapidly caught up with paper check transactions 
looking ahead to  these types of transactions will continue to grow  but expense should decline for the company 
on september   the company signed an agreement with jack henry associates  inc to convert to their core processing software 
preparation has begun for this conversion and it is expected to take place in mid as part of the conversion  the company will be processing its own atm and debit card transactions rather than relying on an intermediary 
this should result in significant cost savings 
the expense for the jack henry conversion is  but all of these costs will be capitalized for between and years  and it will provide greater efficiencies for staff and much enhanced information for the bank and its customers 
the company s effective tax rate for was reduced due to the savings in new york state taxes resulting from the formation of the real estate investment trust 
the effective tax rate for and was and  respectively 
in spite of the increased noninterest expenses of  the efficiency ratio improved from to a result of minimal increases in staff performing the same functions on a greatly increased asset base 
for vs 
noninterest income is comprised of income from operations of the company  excluding interest income 
the two largest contributors to noninterest income during and were service charge income from depositors and revenues from the agency 
the agency was acquired by the bank on august  during  the revenues from the insurance agency became the largest source of the bank s noninterest income 
was the first full year of operation for the bank s newly acquired subsidiary  and the results were very positive 
gross revenues from the agency during and for the four months of were  and  respectively 
net income from the agency was and for the same two period ends 
as the agency has become more fully integrated into the bank  the two entities have served as sources of referrals for each other  and additional synergies between the two have been identified 
providing various types of insurance to many of its loan customers  particularly those in the construction industry  has allowed the bank to offer them a complete package of products 
as the integration between the two affiliates continues  it is expected that additional cost savings to both companies will also be recognized 
service charge income on deposit accounts increased by during  despite the continued growth of free checking products 
this increase was due to the platinum overdraft product that was added in february this new product increased the bank s overdraft fee income by approximately over an additional source of noninterest income for the bank was the gain on cash value of bank owned life insurance policies 
the total cash value of these insurance policies at december  was  as compared to  at december  the insurance polices were purchased to provide for tax free income to fund the various benefit plans for certain officers and directors 
this gain of has offset the majority of the cost for these benefits 
income from operations of the bank s trust department remained stable from to  and represented of total noninterest income for assets under management for the trust department at year end and were  and  miscellaneous other noninterest income totaled  and for and  respectively 
the largest component of this category represented loan fee income  and it increased from in to in this increase was due to the fee income generated from short term loans originated during the year 
total noninterest expense for and was  and  an increase of during these expenses represent operating expenses of the company  and the largest components of these expenses are salary and benefit expense and occupancy expense 
during  salary and benefit expenses  in total  increased by 
one full year of the expenses of the agency was partially responsible for the increase 
the company s contribution to its pension plan remained stable at for both and the cost of medical insurance for the bank s employees increased by during although the staff contributed of the cost for this insurance  the additional paid for by the bank contributed to the increase in operating expenses 
salary expense also increased from to  partially due to the increased number of employees needed to staff the additional branches  to provide quality service to an increasing number of customers  and to manage the additional assets acquired during the year 
net occupancy expense increased from to by  due in large part to the additional rental expenses of the new corporate headquarters and new branch offices 
furniture and equipment expense increases were also a result of the new buildings 
despite these increasing operating expenses  efficiency improved from march  to december  by from to 
other miscellaneous operating expenses comprised and of total noninterest expense 
the largest categories of these expenses were business development and auditing and accounting expense 
marketing and advertising costs increased during as the bank incurred expenses in promoting various deposit products and rates 
auditing and accounting expenses also increased during by  primarily the result of increased fees required for compliance and audit work related to the sarbanes oxley act of  section as a result of the company s acquisition of the seigerman mulvey insurance agency intangible assets were acquired 
these intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationship intangibles which are required to be amortized on a declining balance in accordance with fasb the application of the declining balance method over the estimated life of seven years from acquisition date  will result in greatly increased amortization expense for the company during  with decreasing amortization expense during the following five years 
a schedule detailing these future amortization expenses can be found in note e 
to the company s financial statements 
income tax expense as a percentage of book income effective tax rate for and was and  respectively 
despite state income taxes  holdings of municipal securities provide a source of tax free income which reduces the bank s overall federal income tax rate 
bank owned life insurance policies also reduced the company s tax liability 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk significant increases in the level of market interest rates may adversely affect the fair value of securities and other interest earning assets 
at december  and  the following levels of securities and loans carried fixed interest rates caption balance of portfolio balance of portfolio 
del investment securities   loans   del 
generally  the value of fixed rate investments varies inversely to changes in interest rates 
as a result  increases in interest rates could result in decreases in the market value of interest earning assets 
this decrease in market value could adversely affect the company s results of operations if the loans or securities were sold or  in the case of interest earning assets classified as available for sale  could reduce the company s stockholders equity if they were to be retained 
a significant increase in the level of market interest rates could also adversely affect the bank s net interest income and net interest margin 
now accounts  money market accounts and savings accounts all can be repriced on a daily basis 
if they were all to be repriced upward due to the competitive pressures of a general increase in market rates  net interest income could be reduced 
based on historical experience  increases in deposit rates typically lag increases in loan rates  in which case  the increase in interest expense on these deposits would be offset by the increase in interest income on the loans 
the bank monitors and controls interest rate risk through a variety of techniques including the use of interest rate sensitivity models and interest rate gap analysis 
both of these techniques project future net interest income based on changes in interest rates 
gap analysis requires estimates of when all categories of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will reprice 
gap analysis looks at stated maturities and assumes all assets and liabilities within the same maturity time frame will reprice 
it does not look at the probability of repricing  which in the case of nonmaturity deposits  is up to the discretion of management 
interest rate sensitivity models also rely on various estimates and assumptions  and although a great deal of time and effort is devoted to arriving at these assumptions  any change in the assumptions input to the model can produce very different results 
therefore  both of these techniques may not accurately reflect the actual impact of changes in the interest rate environment on the bank s net interest income 
in spite of these shortcomings  the bank utilizes the results of the dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure to net interest income fluctuations resulting from sustained interest rate changes 
management monitors simulated net interest income sensitivity over a rolling two year horizon 
the results of the sensitivity analysis are compared to policy limits set internally by the asset liability committee that specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a one year horizon given both an upward and downward shift in interest rates 
the last simulation analysis was modeled on a one hundred and two hundred basis point upward and one hundred and two hundred basis point downward shift in interest rates 
a parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a twelve month period is assumed
