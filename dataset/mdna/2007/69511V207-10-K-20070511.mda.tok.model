item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk inflation inflation has not had a material impact on the company s business in recent years 
currency exchange fluctuations all of the company s revenues are denominated either in us dollars or hong kong dollars  while its expenses are denominated primarily in hong kong dollars and chinese renminbi rmb 
the value of the rmb to us dollar or hong kong dollar to united states dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by  among other things  changes in political and economic conditions 
since  the conversion of renminbi into foreign currencies  including us dollars  has been based on rates set by the people s bank of china  which are set daily based on the previous day s inter bank foreign exchange market rates and current exchange rates on the world financial markets 
since  the official exchange rate for the conversion of renminbi to us dollars had generally been stable and the renminbi had appreciated slightly against the us dollar 
however  on july   the chinese government changed its policy of pegging the value of chinese renminbi to the us dollar 
under the new policy  chinese renminbi may fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies 
recently there has been increased political pressure on the chinese government to decouple the renminbi from the united states dollar 
at the recent quarterly regular meeting of people s bank of china  its currency policy committee affirmed the effects of the reform on chinese renminbi exchange rate 
since february  the new currency rate system has been operated  the currency rate of renminbi has become more flexible while basically maintaining stable and the expectation for a larger appreciation range is shrinking 
although a devaluation of the hong kong dollar or renminbi relative to the united states dollar would likely reduce the company s expenses as expressed in united states dollars  any material increase in the value of the hong kong dollar or renminbi relative to the united states dollar would increase the company s expenses  and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
for fluctuations in period to period exchange rates  the translation adjustment is required to translate from local functional currency to the usd reporting currency not rmb to hkd to usd 
the company has never engaged in currency hedging operations and has no present intention to do so 
concentration of credit risk credit risk represents the accounting loss that would be recognized at the reporting date if counterparties failed completely to perform as contracted 
concentrations of credit risk whether on or off balance sheet that arise from financial instruments exist for groups of customers or counterparties when they have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions as described below the company s business is characterized by rapid technological change  new product and service development  and evolving industry standards and regulations 
inherent in the company s business are various risks and uncertainties  including the impact from the volatility of the stock market  limited operating history  uncertain profitability and the ability to raise additional capital 
all of the company s revenue is derived from asia and greater china 
changes in laws and regulations  or their interpretation  or the imposition of confiscatory taxation  restrictions on currency conversion  devaluations of currency or the nationalization or other expropriation of private enterprises could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if the company is unable to derive any revenues from greater china  it would have a significant  financially disruptive effect on the normal operations of the company 
a substantial portion of the operations of business operations depend on mobile telecommunications operators operators in china and any loss or deterioration of such relationship may result in severe disruptions to their business operations and the loss of a significant portion of the company s revenue 
the vies rely entirely on the networks and gateways of these operators to provide its wireless value added services 
specifically these operators are the only entities in china that have platforms for wireless value added services 
the company s agreements with these operators are generally for a period of less than one year and generally do not have automatic renewal provisions 
if neither of them is willing to continue to cooperate with the company  it would severely affect the company s ability to conduct its existing wireless value added services business 
comprehensive income loss comprehensive income loss consists of net earnings and other gains losses affecting stockholders equity that  under generally accepted accounting principles are excluded from net earnings in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  reporting comprehensive income 
additionally  the translation adjustment is recorded as component of comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity section of balance sheet seasonality and quarterly fluctuations several of our businesses experience fluctuations in quarterly performance 
traditionally  the first quarter from january to march is a low season for our call center business due to the long lunar new year holidays in china revenues and income from gaming products  call center and telecom value added services tend to be higher in the fourth quarter due to special holiday promotions 
internet direct commerce revenues also tend to be higher in the fourth quarter due to increased consumer spending during that period 
revenues from the gaming and vas can vary from quarter to quarter due to new product launches and the seasonality of certain product lines 
sales of our gaming machines to macau and other asian casinos and gaming operators are generally strongest in q and q and slowest in the chinese new year holiday season in q in addition  quarterly revenues and net income may increase when we receive a larger number of approvals for new games from regulators and gaming operators than in other quarters  when a game or platform that achieves significant player appeal is introduced or if gaming is permitted in a significant new jurisdiction 
in addition  as further technology advancements become available for the gaming industry  replacement or conversion of gaming machines will be impacted once any such advanced technology is approved by regulators
