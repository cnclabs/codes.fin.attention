item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with royale energy s financial statements and notes thereto and other financial information relating to royale energy included elsewhere in this document 
for the past thirteen years  royale energy has primarily acquired and developed producing and non producing natural gas properties in california 
in the past five years  royale energy has also participated in drilling oil and gas wells in texas 
in  royale energy began developing leases in utah 
the most significant factors affecting the results of operations are i changes in the sales price of natural gas  ii recording of turnkey drilling revenues and the associated drilling expense  and iii the change in natural gas reserves owned by royale energy 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition royale energy s financial statements include its pro rata ownership of wells 
royale energy usually sells a portion of the working interest in each lease that it acquires to third party investors and retains a portion of the prospect for its own account 
royale energy generally retains about a working interest 
all results  successful or not  are included at its pro rata ownership amounts revenue  expenses  assets  and liabilities 
royale energy has developed two profit oriented segments of business marketing direct working interests dwi  and producing and selling oil and gas 
royale energy derives dwi revenue from sales of working interests to high net worth individuals 
the dwi revenue is divided into payments for pre drilling costs and for drilling costs 
dwi investments are non refundable 
royale energy recognizes the pre drilling revenue portion when the investor deposits money with royale energy 
the company holds the remaining investment in trust as deferred revenue until drilling is complete 
occasionally  drilling is delayed due to the permitting process  or drilling rig availability 
at december  and  royale energy had deferred drilling revenue of  and  respectively 
the second business segment is oil and gas production 
northern and central california account for approximately of the company s successful natural gas production 
natural gas flows from the wells into gathering line systems  which are equipped occasionally with compressor systems  which in turn flow into metered transportation and customer pipelines 
monthly  price data and daily production are used to invoice customers for amounts due to royale energy and other working interest owners 
royale energy operates virtually all of its own wells and receives industry standard operator fees 
oil and gas property and equipment royale energy follows the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas properties 
costs are accumulated on a field by field basis 
these costs include pre drilling activities such as leasing rents paid  drilling costs  and post drilling tangible costs 
costs of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated 
royale energy regularly evaluates its unproved properties on a field by field basis for possible impairment 
due to the unpredictable nature of exploration drilling activities  the amount and timing of impairment expenses are difficult to predict with any certainty 
depletion the units of production method of accounting uses proved reserves in the calculation of depletion  depreciation and amortization 
proved reserves are estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
proved reserves cannot be measured exactly  and the estimation of reserves involves judgment determinations 
independent engineering reserve estimates must be reviewed and adjusted periodically to reflect additional information gained from reservoir performance  new geological and geophysical data and economic changes 
the estimates are based on current technology and economic conditions  and royale energy considers such estimates to be reasonable and consistent with current knowledge of the characteristics and extent of production 
the independent engineering estimates include only those amounts considered to be proved rese rves and do not include additional amounts which may result from new discoveries in the future  or from application of secondary and tertiary recovery processes where facilities are not in place or for which transportation and or marketing contracts are not in place 
changes in previous estimates of proved reserves result from new information obtained from production history and changes in economic factors 
impairment of assets producing property costs are evaluated for impairment and reduced to fair value if the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than net book value pursuant to statement of financial accounting standard accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
impairment of non producing leasehold costs and undeveloped mineral and royalty interests are assessed periodically on a property by property basis and any impairment in value is charged to expense 
we periodically review for impairment of proved properties on a field by field basis 
unamortized capital costs are measured on a field basis and are reduced to fair value if it is determined that the sum of expected future net cash flows are less than the net book value 
we determine if impairment has occurred through either adverse changes or as a result of its periodic review for impairment 
impairment is measured on discounted cash flows utilizing a discount rate appropriate for risks associated with the related properties o r based on fair market values 
we regard impairment costs as a component of our turnkey drilling overhead  since impairment costs amount to a write down of previously acquired property inventory that we were unable to successfully develop as part of our turnkey drilling program 
estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the most significant estimates pertain to proved oil  plant products and gas reserve volumes and the future development costs 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects  calculated at currently enacted rates  of a future deductible taxable amounts attributable to events that have been recognized on a cumulative basis in the financial statements or income tax returns  and b operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more likely than not that the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
changes in accounting principles asset retirement obligations in june  the fasb approved for issuance sfas  asset retirement obligations 
sfas establishes accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets such as wells and production facilities 
see note to our financial statements summary of significant accounting policies recently issued accounting pronouncements 
royale energy adopted the statement as of january  suspended well costs on april   the financial accounting standards board posted fsp fas  accounting for suspended well costs  to be effective for reporting periods beginning after april  we have adopted fsp fas effective as of july  the guidance set forth in the fsp requires that we evaluate all existing capitalized exploratory well costs and disclose the extent to which any such capitalized costs have become impaired and are expensed or reclassified during a fiscal period 
we performed an evaluation of our capitalized costs and determined that no previously capitalized exploratory well costs pending the determination of proved reserves were required to be expensed or reclassified during the third quarter of or we did not make any additions to capitalized exploratory well costs pending a determination of proved reserves during or we did not charge any previously capitalized exploratory well costs to expense upon adoption of fsp fas at december  and  no capitalized well costs had been capitalized for more than one year 
results of operations for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the twelve months ended december  for the year ended december   we had a net loss of  a  decrease compared to the net profit of  achieved during the largest single component of the loss was a result of an impairment of  which we realized due to the decrease in reserve values at year end these decreased reserve values also caused our depletion rate to increase which led to a higher depletion expense 
total revenues from operations for the year in were  a decrease of  or  from the total revenues of  in in our natural gas revenues decreased due to lower natural gas production and prices  but this decrease was largely offset by increased turnkey drilling revenues 
in addition to operating revenue  we realized a one time gain of million from the sale of a number of wells in the sacramento basin 
we sold these properties to reduce overall cost of operation and realign cash toward higher potential drilling opportunities 
in  revenues from oil and gas production decreased by to  from  in  due to a decrease in natural gas production 
the net sales volume of natural gas for the year ended december   was approximately  mcf with an average price of per mcf  versus  mcf with an average price of per mcf for this represents a decrease in net sales volume of  mcf or 
this decline in production was the result of several factors 
these include a natural decline of production from our existing oil and gas wells and delays in bringing new production on line due to limited drilling rig availability in california 
this limited rig availability delayed our being able to start new drilling and proceed with necessary workovers on existing wells 
the net sales volume for oil and condensate natural gas liquids production was  barrels with an average price of per barrel for the year ended december   compared to  barrels a t an average price of per barrel for the year in this represents an increase in net sales volume of  barrels  or 
oil and gas lease operating expenses decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year in the decrease was due to increased efficiency and a reduction in workover activity and associated costs in compared to when measuring lease operating costs on a production or lifting cost basis  in  the  equates to a per mcfe lifting cost versus a per mcfe lifting cost in  a decrease 
for the year ended december   turnkey drilling revenues increased  to  in from  in  or 
we also had a  or increase in turnkey drilling and development costs to  in from  in the higher turnkey drilling revenues and drilling and development costs were mainly due to increases in both direct working interest sales and in the number and cost of wells drilled during when compared to we drilled six exploratory wells and ten developmental wells in versus six exploratory wells and nine developmental wells in exploratory wells tend to be more expensive due to new lease  geological and geophysical and facility costs 
our gross margins  or profits  on drilling depend on our ability to accurately estimate the costs associated with the development of projects in which we sell working interests and to acquire viable properties that can be successfully developed 
costs associa ted with contract drilling depend on location  well depth  weather  and availability of drilling contractors and equipment 
our gross margin on drilling was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gross margin is calculated as the difference between turnkey drilling revenue and turnkey drilling expense 
however  management believes that a portion of its impairment losses should also be considered as a cost of drilling in determining the profitability of this segment  because impairment costs are incurred in the selection of higher quality prospects for ultimate development 
impairment losses of  and  were recorded in and  respectively 
in  we recorded impairments in fields where year end reserve values no longer supported the net book values of wells in those fields 
the primary focus of this impairment   was recorded for our wells in the texas and gulf coast fields 
there were several wells in this area that had been drilled in the last few years which had significantly lower production and reserves than originally estimated 
the company holds a non operated interest in this property  and had been unable to influence operational decisions to set lower risk objectives 
as a result  the company will seek other strategic partners to assist in the future development of this property 
the bowerbank field in california was impaired for  mainly for older wells which ceased producing due to their natural declines 
our cache creek field was impaired for its remaining value of  due to the drilling of the north crossroads which proved unsuccessful 
the willows field was also impaired for  due to the drilling of the north willows which although successful had lower reserves than originally estimated 
in  we recorded an impairment in our afton field due to drilling exploratory wells which were not successful 
we also recorded an impairment in the cache creek field as a result of the  north crossroads and north crossroads  watering out and ceasing production in we periodically review our accounts receivable from working interest owners to determine whether collection of any of these charges where doubtful 
the company does not to attempt collection from its direct working interest owners for certain wells that ceased production or had been sold during the year  to the extent that these charges exceed production revenue 
as a result of that review in and  we established an allowance of  and  respectively  for receivables from these direct working interest owners 
the aggregate of supervisory fees and other income was  for the year ended december   a decrease of  from  during the year in this was due to a decrease in cost recovery received for use of facilities constructed and placed into service during prior periods as a result of lower production levels 
supervisory fees are charged in accordance with the council for petroleum accountants societies copas policy for reimbursement of expenses associated with the joint accounting for billing  revenue disbursement  and payment of taxes and royalties 
these charges are reevaluated each year and adjusted up or down as deemed appropriate by a published report to the industry by ernst young  llp  public accountants 
supervisory fees decreased  or  to  in from  in depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased to  from  an increase of  for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in the depletion rate is calculated using production as a percentage of reserves 
this increase in depreciation expense was mainly due to a higher depletion rate because of lower reserves at the end of we also reevaluated our inventory of capitalized geological lease and land costs  in order to write off those prospects that may be no longer viable 
as a result   of previously capitalized costs were written off and recorded as geological and geophysical expense during  compared with  written off in  an  or increase 
this expense is directly attributable to the selection and prioritization of the quality of the company s drilling prospects 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year in this increase was mainly due to the increase in bad debts expense of  from  in to  in  for receivables from direct working interest investors whose expenses on non producing wells was unlikely to be collected 
employee related travel and lodging costs also increased by  legal and accounting expense increased to  for the year  compared to  for year  a  or increase 
this increase was due to higher legal fees due to litigation defending property rights during marketing expense for the year ended december  decreased  or  to  compared to  for the year in marketing expense varies from period to period according to the number of marketing events attended by personnel and their associated costs 
during the year  interest expense increased to  from  in  a  or increase 
this was due to an increase in the interest rate charged to the company  which went from at december   to at december  in we had an income tax benefit of  mainly due to our net loss before taxes of  and the utilization of our depletion carryforwards 
in our income tax expense was  due to our net income before taxes of  for the period in  this represents an effective tax rate of approximately  respectively 
the use of percentage depletion created from the current operations  and from utilization of unused percentage depletion carryforwards  results in an effective tax rate less than the normal federal rate of plus the relevant state rates mostly california  results of operations for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the twelve months ended december  for the year ended december   we had a net profit of  a  or decrease compared to the net profit of  achieved during we attribute this to higher lease impairment costs and intensifying marketing efforts 
total revenues for the year in were  a decrease of  or from the total revenues of  in this was mainly due to lower cost recovery fees due to decreased production 
in  revenues from oil and gas production increased by to  from  due to increased natural gas and oil prices 
the net sales volume of natural gas for the year ended december   was approximately  mcf with an average price of per mcf  versus  mcf with an average price of per mcf for this represents a decrease in net sales volume of  mcf or 
this decrease in production was a result of several factors including the natural decline on our oil and gas wells and the lack of new production because of a delay in starting our drilling projects due to limited drilling rig availability in california 
the net sales volume for oil and condensate natural gas liquids production was  barrels with an average price of per barrel for the year ended december   compared to  barrels at an average price of per barrel for the year in this represents a decrease in net sales volume of  barrels  or oil and gas lease operating expenses decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year in the decrease was due to a decrease in the number of operated wells 
when measuring lease operating costs on a production or lifting cost basis  in  the  equates to a per mcfe lifting cost versus a per mcfe lifting cost in  a increase 
for the year ended december   turnkey drilling revenues decreased  to  in from  in  or 
we also had a  or decrease in turnkey drilling and development costs to  in from  in the decrease in turnkey drilling revenues was mainly due to a decrease in direct working interest sales during the year in when compared to the year in the decrease in drilling and development costs was due to lower cost wells drilled in when compared to we drilled six exploratory wells and nine developmental in versus ten exploratory wells and four developmental wells in exploratory wells tend to be more expensive due to new lease  geological and geophysical and facility costs 
our gross margins  or profits  on drilling depend on our ability to accurately estimate the costs associated with the development of projects in which we sell working interests and to acquire viable properties that can be successfully developed 
costs associated with contract drilling depend on location  well depth  weather  and availability of drilling contractors and equipment 
our gross margin on drilling was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gross margin is calculated as the difference between turnkey drilling revenue and turnkey drilling expense 
however  management believes that a portion of its impairment losses should also be considered as a cost of drilling in determining the profitability of this segment  because impairment costs are incurred in the selection of higher quality prospects for ultimate development 
impairment losses of  and  were recorded in and  respectively 
in  we determined that an impairment was appropriate in the afton field  which was acquired in  due to a delay in drilling exploratory wells in the field as a result of pipeline restrictions 
in addition  we recorded an impairment for the elkhorn slough field due to cost overruns on our kingfisher well due to mechanical problems while completing it 
during the second quarter of  we suffered a blowout of our bowerbank sam well during recompletion operations 
the blowout and clean up resulted in net costs of  chargeable to working interest investors for their share of the blowout 
we created an allowance for theses expenses when they were incurred in  while we decided whether to seek to recover them from direct working interest investors 
when the allowance was created  we also decided to have our internal accounting staff review other accounts receivable from investors for well expenses were doubtful and should be added to the allowance 
our internal review showed that working interest investor account balances in an amount of  including the  attributed to the bowerbank sam could not be collected from well operations alone  because those wells had ceased operating 
these accounts were placed in the allowance as of year end 
we ultimately decided not to seek recovery of theses costs from the working interest investors  and all of these receivables were written off in the aggregate of supervisory fees and other income was  for the year ended december   a decrease of  from  during the year in this was due to a decrease in cost recovery received for use of facilities constructed and placed into service during prior periods due to lower production 
supervisory fees are charged in accordance with the council for petroleum accountants societies copas policy for reimbursement of expenses associated with the joint accounting for billing  revenue disbursement  and payment of taxes and royalties 
these charges are reevaluated each year and adjusted up or down as deemed appropriate by a published report to the industry by ernst young  llp  public accountants 
supervisory fees increased  or  to  in from  in depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased to  from  an increase of  for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in the depletion rate is calculated using production as a percentage of reserves 
this increase in depletion expense was mainly due to an increase in the depletion rate because of higher rates of production when compared to total reserves and in the number of oil and gas assets that we own 
we also reevaluated our inventory of capitalized geological lease and land costs  in order to write off those prospects that may be no longer viable 
as a result   of previously capitalized costs were written off and recorded as geological and geophysical expense during compared with  written off in  a  or increase 
general and administrative expenses decreased by  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year in legal and accounting expense decreased to  for the period  compared to  for year  a  or decrease 
these decreases were due to lower audit  tax preparation and legal fees during the year in marketing expense for the year ended december  increased  or  to  compared to  for the year in marketing expense varies from period to period according to the number of marketing events attended by personnel and their associated costs 
in we also increased the use of outside brokers to increase direct working interest sales 
during the period in  we increased long term debt under our commercial bank credit line 
the interest rate charged to the company also increased from at december   to at december  this increased interest expense to  for the year ended december   from  for the same period in  a  or increase 
in our income tax expense decreased to  from  in  a  or decrease  mainly due to the decrease in our net income 
for the periods in and  this represents an effective tax rate of approximately and  respectively 
the use of percentage depletion created from the current operations  and from utilization of unused percentage depletion carryforwards  results in an effective tax rate less than the normal federal rate of plus the relevant state rates mostly california  capital resources and liquidity at december   royale energy had current assets totaling  and current liabilities totaling  a  working capital surplus 
we had cash and cash equivalents at december  of  compared to  at december  our capital expenditure commitments occur as we decide to drill wells to develop our prospects 
we generally do not decide to drill any prospect until we have sold a portion of the working interest in a prospect to third parties to diversify our risk and receive a portion of the funds to drill each prospect 
we place funds that we receive from third party investors into a separate cash account until they are required for expenditures on each well 
our capital expenditure needs in addition to those needs are satisfied by selling part of the working interest in prospects 
we have not  in past years  experienced shortages of funds needed to satisfy our capital expenditure requirements 
we expect that our available credit and cash flows from operations will be sufficient for capital expenditure needs beyond those satisfied from sales of working interests 
we ordinarily fund our operations and cash needs from cash flows generated from operations 
during the fourth quarter of each year  we receive a large percentage of the revenue generated by our sales of working interests to third parties  as individual high net worth investors make investments according to their own year end financial planning 
we also incur a large percentage of our costs for drilling activities in the third and fourth quarters of each year 
webelieve that we have sufficient liquidity for and do not foresee any liquidity demands that cannot be met from cash flow from operations 
at the end of  our accounts receivable totaled  compared to  at december   a  or decrease  mainly due to decreased revenue receivables due to lower natural gas prices at the end of as compared to at december   our accounts payable and accrued expenses totaled  a decrease of  or over the accounts payable at the end of of  this was primarily due to payments on trade accounts payable from proceeds of the sale of oil and gas assets at the end of occasionally we borrow from banks  using our oil and gas properties as security 
in  we made net principal repayments of approximately  on our credit line  mainly due to the oil and gas asset sale at the end of the year 
during the year ended december   we drew approximately  net from our credit line in order to meet our drilling schedule 
we have a revolving line of credit under a loan agreement with guaranty bank  fsb  which is secured by all of our oil and gas properties 
at december   we had outstanding indebtedness of  unused available credit from this revolving line of credit totaled approximately  at december  at december   we had outstanding indebtedness under this agreement of  the loan agreement also contains certain restrictive covenants  including the prohibition of payment of dividends on our stock other than dividends paid in stock 
the loan agreement contained covenants that  among other things  we must maintain a minimum ratio of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization to debt service requirements of at least to  maintain a ratio of bank determined current assets to bank determined current liabilities of at least to  and maintain a tangible net worth as of the close of each fiscal quarter of at least  as of september   plus of positive quarterly net income thereafter 
at december   royale energy was in compliance with its loan covenants 
during we obtained a new loan from guaranty bank  fsb for  which is secured by our non oil and gas real estate assets  which was primarily used to fund operations 
in  portion of the real estate was subsequently sold during the year resulting in an additional  principal payment 
at december   we had outstanding indebtedness of  on this loan 
the principal balance of this loan was repaid in march we do not engage in hedging activities or use derivative instruments to manage market risks 
the following schedule summarizes our known contractual cash obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
total obligations beyond office lease long term debt total operating activities 
for the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities totaled  compared to  provided by operating activities for the same period in  a  or decrease  mainly due to our net loss from operations 
cash provided by operating activities for decreased  or as compared to  for the year ended december  mainly due to decreases in net income from operations 
investing activities 
net cash provided by investing activities netted to  for the year in  which included  used for oil and gas and other capital expenditures along with proceeds from our asset sales of  compared to  used by investing activities for the same period in net cash used by investing activities in increased  compared to  used by investing activities for the same period in this increase in cash used was primarily due to the increased number of wells drilled  nine developmental and six exploratory in and four developmental and exploratory in financing activities 
for the year ended december  cash used by financing activities was  compared to  provided by financing activities for the same period in this difference in cash was primarily due to net principal loan repayments during when compared to due to the asset sale 
the net cash provided by financing activities in of  decreased  when compared to  provided by financing activities for the same period in this difference in cash provided was primarily due to decreases in borrowings during when compared to changes in reserve estimates in  our estimated proved developed and undeveloped reserve quantities were revised downward by approximately million cubic feet of natural gas  barrels of oil 
see  supplemental information about oil and gas producing activities unaudited  page f during  it was discovered that four producing wells had lower than previously estimated non producing gas reserves  resulting in a reduction of proved developed non producing gas reserves 
also during  two prospects that had been previously estimated to contain proved undeveloped gas reserve were re evaluated and found to have lower than expected reserves and as a result were not drilled 
one other prospect with proved undeveloped reserves was drilled and resulted in proved reserves less than prior estimates 
the revisions of previous estimates attributable to these wells accounted for approximately of the net downward revisions of previous gas reserve estimates 
the reduction in oil reserve estimates in was due to a re evaluation of two prospects that had been previously estimated to contain proved undeveloped oil reserves were found to have lower than expected reserves and as a result were not drilled 
also  one prospect with proved undeveloped oil reserves was drilled and resulted in proved oil reserves less than prior estimates 
the revisions of previous estimates attributable to these wells accounted for approximately of the net downward revisions of previous gas reserve estimates 
the following table summarizes the major reasons for reserve reductions in oil gas four existing wells with lower estimated proved non producing reserves reduction of pud due to two undrilled wells reduction of pud based on drilling results total in  our estimated proved developed and undeveloped reserve quantities were revised downward by approximately million cubic feet of natural gas  barrels of oil 
see  supplemental information about oil and gas producing activities unaudited  page f during  three producing wells ceased producing  resulting in a reduction in proved developed reserves 
also during  one prospect that had been previously estimated to contain proved undeveloped gas reserve was drilled and resulted in a dry hole  and two other prospects with proved undeveloped reserves were drilled and resulted in proved reserves less than prior estimates 
the revisions of previous estimates attributable to these wells accounted for approximately of the net downward revisions of previous gas reserve estimates 
the reduction in oil reserve estimates in was mainly due to re evaluation of one oil condensate well  which was drilled at the end of and began production in based on its production experience  oil reserves for that well were reduced by  barrels  which equals of net oil reserve reductions in the following table summarizes the major reasons for reserve reductions in oil gas two existing wells which ceased production reduction of pud due to one dry hole reduction of pud based on drilling results total in  the cessation of production from one well and significant downward revision of a second well accounted for downward revisions of more than million cubic feet of proved developed reserves  which is of the net revisions in both wells had been producing gas wells 
the reserve estimate for one well was revised downward by  cubic feet to  and the reserve estimate of the second well was revised downward by  cubic feet to  cubic feet 
item a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk royale energy is exposed to market risk from changes in commodity prices and in interest rates 
in  we sold a majority of our natural gas at the daily market rate through the pacific gas electric pipeline 
in  our natural gas revenues were approximately million with an average price of per mcf 
at current production levels  a per mcf increase or decrease in our average price received could potentially increase or decrease our natural gas revenues by approximately  at our current production levels of oil and natural gas condensate  a increase or decrease in our average price per barrel could potentially increase or decrease our oil and natural gas revenues by approximately  we currently do not sell any of our natural gas or oil through hedging contracts 
we have a line of credit used in funding purchases of oil and gas assets  meeting drilling schedules and assisting in funding operations 
this line of credit is tied to increases or decreases in the bank prime interest rate 
if the interest rate on our line of credit were to increase or during the year this could potentially add approximately  to  respectively  to our interest expense
