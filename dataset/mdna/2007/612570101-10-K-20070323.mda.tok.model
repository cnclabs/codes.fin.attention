item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes and other information included in this report 
the financial results reported herein do not indicate the financial results that may be achieved by the company in any future period 
background monterey gourmet foods was incorporated in june as a producer and wholesaler of refrigerated gourmet pasta and sauces to restaurants and grocery stores in the monterey  ca area 
the company has since expanded its operations to provide a variety of gourmet refrigerated food products to grocery and club stores throughout the united states  selected regions in canada  the caribbean  latin america and asia pacific 
the company s overall strategic plan is to enhance the value of the monterey gourmet foods brands by distributing its gourmet products through multiple channels of distribution 
the company s product distribution to grocery and club stores increased from approximately stores as of december  to over  stores by december  during recent years the company added retail and club distribution through internal growth and through the frescala foods  nate s  isabella s kitchen  emerald valley kitchen  cibo  sonoma cheese  and casual gourmet acquisitions 
in  the company s shareholders approved the change of the name of the company to monterey gourmet foods  inc the name change was made to define the company s strategic direction more accurately 
the name change also announces to the investor community  our customers and consumers  our strategic direction to become a complete supplier of gourmet refrigerated foods 
in the company began a diversification strategy to expand its product line beyond refrigerated pasta and pasta sauce 
the diversification strategy was a combination of both internal product development and external acquisitions 
in january  the company acquired cibo naturals  a maker of sauces  dips and spreads 
in the company launched new products such as chicken penne gratin  chicken and mozzarella ravioli  and pork and chicken tamales 
additionally the company was able to increase distribution by introducing whole wheat pastas which are high in dietary fiber  have a favorable glycemic index  and are made from whole grains 
in the company acquired two additional companies 
the company markets under the casual gourmet brand acquired january  flavorful low fat  low calorie chicken sausages  chicken burgers and soups  and under the sonoma cheese brand acquired april an outstanding line of refrigerated specialty cheese products that features its flagship line of sonoma jack cheeses 
sonoma cheese has earned numerous awards over the years for its traditional and flavored jack cheeses 
monterey gourmet foods believes that the convenient gourmet food segment is growing rapidly as time starved consumers seek high quality quick meal solutions and the company  with its staff of senior chefs and its flexible manufacturing facilities  is well positioned to bring new products to these consumers 
in  the company focused on expanding distribution of its current products  consolidating production facilities in salinas  improving the quality of its current products  hiring experts in product development and creativity to better utilize the company s production equipment  improving the synergies between the different brands  and reorganizing the company into one operating unit with one centralized sales force and one marketing department 
also during  the board of directors of the company appointed eric eddings as president and chief executive officer of monterey gourmet foods following the resignation of james m 
williams effective september  in the fourth quarter of  casual gourmet saw a significant reduction in its sales to its two largest customers  costco and sam s club 
the company took many steps to restore the sales to these two major customers  including the introduction of such items as anti biotic free abf all white meat chicken sausages  nitrite free chicken sausages  sausages made with organic chicken  flavored pork sausages  and other products that fit under the casual gourmet label 
the company also introduced these products into the retail market place through monterey gourmet foods retail sales force 
in the spring of  these new items restored casual s sales to its level of sales of the prior year and therefore the company did not impair its intangible assets 
however  between the dates of august  and september   the company was informed that these new items would be discontinued in select divisions of costco 
due to the lost business during the third quarter of  the company tested for the potential impairment of goodwill as the loss of business was considered a triggering event under sfas and sfas as well for amortized intangibles 
as a result of the impairment test  the company recorded a pre tax  non cash charge of million in the third quarter of related to the impairment of intangible assets associated with the casual gourmet foods acquisition on january  the success of the company s efforts to increase revenue will depend on several key factors whether grocery and club store chains will continue to increase the number of their stores offering the company s products  whether the company can continue to increase the number of grocery and club store chains offering its products  whether the company can continue to introduce new products that meet consumer acceptance  whether the company  by diversifying into other complementary businesses through new product offerings or acquisitions can leverage its strengths and continue to grow revenues at levels attractive to its investors  whether the newly acquired acquisitions perform as planned when purchased  and whether the company can maintain and increase the number of items it is selling to its two largest customers 
grocery and club store chains continually re evaluate the products carried in their stores  and no assurances can be given that the chains currently offering the company s product will continue to do so in the future 
the company believes that access to capital resources and increasing sales to offset higher fixed overhead  coupled with continued reduction of its administrative and production costs as a percent of sales revenue  will be key requirements in the company s efforts to enhance its competitive position and increase its market penetration 
in order to support its expansion program  the company continues to develop new products for consumers and revise advertising and promotional activities for its retail grocery and club store accounts 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase its net revenues from grocery and club stores 
because the company will continue to make expenditures associated with the expansion of its business  the company s results of operations may be affected 
operations for  and net revenues were as follows in s caption years ended 
del net revenues    percent change in net revenues from prior year del 
the increase in sales of  over is due to the increased volume at our all natural brands of cibo naturals and emerald valley organics which increased or million over  the introduction of fresh tamales which sold heavily in the fourth quarter of  and increases from the core pasta business 
additionally  sonoma foods recorded twelve months of sales in compared to only nine months in  an increase of million  because sonoma foods was acquired in april the casual gourmet product lines recorded a revenue decline of million when comparing the twelve months ended december  with the twelve months ended december  during  and the company reduced net revenues by   and  respectively for costs associated with placement of product in new stores in various locations 
the increase compared to was due to the additional volume generated from the acquisitions of cibo  emerald valley  casual gourmet foods  and sonoma foods some of which had sales in the previous year 
excluding sales generated from these four acquisitions  net sales increased 
again excluding sales generated from these four acquisitions  sales to costco increased compared to  however  sales to sam s club declined in compared to the company s monterey pasta brand retail business  excluding the sales to the club stores  which has been a focus for the company  was up when compared to the previous year and was up in the second half of when compared to the second half of the success of the company s new whole wheat pastas helped fuel this growth 
the change in net revenues was mostly a result of changes in volume sold and only a small portion is a result of price changes for the company s products 
in addition  casual gourmet  the specialty poultry sausage and soup marketer experienced several setbacks of product distribution and sales with its two largest customers during the fourth quarter of in both cases  losses were related to the customer s change in merchandising strategy and increased competition within the poultry sausage category 
casual gourmet management responded quickly with innovative new products  including products in the much larger pork sausage category 
casual regained several product placements with key club customers during the first quarter of  however these items were subsequently discontinued in the third quarter of the company has embarked upon a diversification strategy which included the acquisition of emerald valley kitchen in  cibo naturals  llc in  and casual gourmet foods and sonoma foods in the table below shows the percent of net revenues these four acquisitions have represented caption years ended

the gross profit dollars for increased  compared to due to increased sales volume 
the improvement in gross margin percent for compared to the is a function of cost savings obtained by running more efficiently and an improvement in product mix

also in  the company experienced certain write off costs associated with a failed frozen ravioli appetizer product 
in addition  the company announced on september  a reduction in its salaried work force 
part of the severances paid reduced the company s gross margin 
in  the company consolidated its two salinas  ca plants which the company believes will improve margins 
the impact of future change on the company s gross profit is difficult to quantify because of its sensitivity to volume through the plant 
the gross margin improvement of  compared with was a function of higher sales  higher production volume through the company s currently operating plants  reduced fixed costs  and reduced labor costs 
gross margin percent improvement compared to prior year was a function of cost savings from higher plant volume  lower fixed costs  and also an improvement in product mix especially from recent acquisitions  offset by higher utility and rent costs 
management has continued to reorganize and reduce its workforce in salinas  where the number of employees has been reduced by approximately since the company charged   and  to cost of sales for   and respectively  for obsolete packaging and raw material inventory

the company s deferred tax assets are comprised primarily of net operating losses that can offset future taxable income 
management has established a million valuation allowance against future deferred tax assets based on its assessment of the sources of future taxable income and the likelihood of realization of such deferred tax assets 
additionally  the company realized additional tax benefits as a result of the exercise of non qualified stock options and the exercise and subsequent sale of certain incentive stock options or disqualifying dispositions in   and for financial reporting purposes  when a deduction exceeds the deferred tax assets  the resulting reduction in actual income tax obligations as a result of these disqualifying dispositions is credited to additional paid in capital

critical accounting policies and management judgments the discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements included in item the preparation of these financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates and discusses with its audit committee these estimates and assumptions  including those related to accounts receivable and allowances  goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes  inventory valuation  workers compensation reserves and revenue recognition 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements business combinations the consolidated financial statements include the company s accounts and the accounts of wholly and majority owned subsidiaries 
the company consolidates all of the majority owned subsidiaries and reflects minority interest of sonoma foods on the consolidated balance sheet because of the uncertainty that monterey will purchase the remaining shares from the minority shareholders 
monterey is the sole source of any financing needed by its majority owned subsidiaries 
in accordance with business combination accounting  the company allocates the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from product sales  customer lists  recipes and processes  the acquired company s brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about growth rates  gross margins  market penetration  and discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
for business combinations  the company must record deferred taxes relating to the book versus tax basis differences of acquired assets and liabilities 
generally  such business combinations result in deferred tax liabilities as the book values are reflected at fair value whereas the tax basis is carried over from the acquired company 
such deferred taxes are initially estimated based on preliminary information and are subject to change as valuations and tax returns are finalized 
accounts receivable and allowances the company provides allowances for estimated credit losses  product returns  spoilage  and adjustments at a level deemed appropriate to adequately provide for known and inherent risks related to such amounts 
the allowances are based on reviews of the history of losses  returns  spoilage  contractual relationships with customers  current economic conditions  and other factors which warrant consideration in estimating potential losses 
while management uses the best information available in making its determination  the ultimate recovery of recorded accounts  notes  and other receivables is also dependent on future economic and other conditions that may be beyond management s control 
income taxes the company accounts for corporate income taxes in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for income taxes which requires an asset and liability approach 
this approach results in the recognition of deferred tax assets future tax benefits and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary timing differences between the book carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
future tax benefits are subject to a valuation allowance to the extent of the likelihood that the deferred tax assets may not be realized 
the company s deferred tax assets include significant amounts of net operating losses nols 
during  the valuation allowance was increased based on the management s judgment that it is not more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets can be realized partly due to the intangible asset impairment of the casual gourmet foods which affected the company s assessment of the realization of our nols 
the amount of the valuation allowance is significantly dependant on management s assumptions regarding future taxable income and the availability of these nols to offset future taxable income 
the effect on the company s net income is significant whenever the estimate changes 
for business combinations  the company must record deferred taxes and liabilities relating to the book versus tax basis differences of acquired assets and liabilities 
generally  such business combinations result in deferred tax liabilities as the book values are reflected at fair value whereas the tax basis is carried over from the acquired company 
such deferred taxes initially are estimated based on preliminary information and are subject to change as valuations and tax returns are finalized 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost using the first in  first out method or market and consist principally of component ingredients to the company s refrigerated pasta and sauces  finished goods  and packaging materials 
many of the ingredients used in the company s products have a short shelf life and if not used in a certain amount of time may spoil 
management estimates that the raw material will be used in a timely manner  however  management has established certain reserves for the potential of inventory obsolescence  especially for slow moving inventory 
as of december   the company reduced the carrying value of its inventory by  this write down was made to cover certain refrigerated raw material inventory that is nearing its shelf life  and certain packaging labels for products that may be rotated out of the club store accounts  and products that have already been rotated out of the club store accounts that may or may not be rotated back into the club store accounts 
the allowance is established based on management s estimate of alternative usage or salvage value of obsolete inventory 
management believes its estimates for spoiled and obsolete inventory is adequate given the current volume of business to its current customers 
workers compensation reserve the company s california and oregon locations entered into a partially self insured worker s compensation program for fiscal year and have continued the program into this program features a fixed annual payment  with a deductible on a per occurrence basis 
the annual expense consists of a base fee paid to an insurance company to administer the program  direct cash expenses to pay for injuries  an estimate for potential injuries that may have occurred but have not been reported  an estimate by the insurance company of costs to close out each injury and an estimate for injury development 
the company has been on this partially self insured program for just over four years and therefore has limited history of claim resolution available to support the company s projected liabilities 
therefore the company is using published industry actuarial data from an insurance carrier and reviewing each claim individually to determine the amount of reserves that should be established 
management believes that its current safety program and its safety record will provide the foundation to enable the company to realize the premium savings partially self insured programs are designed to achieve  however  estimated reserves may vary from future cash outlays 
the remaining locations are on a fixed premium insurance contract that covers all costs including claims 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenues through sales of its products primarily to grocery and club store chains 
revenues are recognized once there is evidence of an arrangement such as a customer purchase order  product has been shipped or delivered to the customer depending on the customer s purchase orders  the price and terms are fixed  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
accordingly  sales are recorded when goods are shipped or delivered  at which time title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  consistent with the freight terms for most customers 
potential returns  adjustments and spoilage allowances are considered as a reduction in revenues and are provided for in accounts receivable allowances and accruals 
for new products or new customers  all pricing is calculated based on fob shipping point 
the company records its shipping cost for product delivered to customers in selling  general  and administrative expense 
any amounts charged to customers for freight and deliveries are included in revenues 
certain incentives granted to customers such as promotions  trade ads  slotting fees  terms discounts  and coupons are recorded as offsets to revenues 
valuation of goodwill indefinite lived intangible assets under sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are to be tested for impairment at least annually 
the primary identifiable intangible assets of the company s reporting unit with indefinite lives are trademarks  tradenames and goodwill acquired in business acquisitions 
as of december   the net book value of trademarks and other identifiable indefinite lived intangible assets was million 
the company defines a reporting unit as a unit one level below its operating segment 
a reporting unit exists if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment managers regularly review the operating results of the component 
as of december   the company determined that it had one reporting unit based on the company s internal reorganization which integrated the company s brands to a more functional reporting structure 
prior to the fourth quarter of  the company had four reporting units as its acquirees operations were not integrated 
identifiable indefinite lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization and are assessed for impairment at least as often as annually and as triggering events may occur 
the impairment test for identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset s reporting unit with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  then a second step of assessment is performed to measure the impairment loss  if any 
given the company s internal reorganization in which the company operates under one reporting unit  management primarily relies on the company s market capitalization to determine fair value 
secondarily  the company relies on a number of factors to discount anticipated future cash flows including operating results  business plans and present value techniques 
rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at the relevant point in time 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment in applying them to the analysis of intangible asset impairment 
it is possible that assumptions underlying the impairment analysis will change in such a manner that impairment in value may occur in the future 
goodwill is not amortized but is subject to periodic assessments of impairment 
at december   the company had million of goodwill on its books 
goodwill is assessed for impairment at least as often as annually and as triggering events may occur 
the company performs its annual review in the fourth quarter of each year 
recoverability of goodwill is evaluated using a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value 
in evaluating the recoverability of goodwill  it is necessary to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit 
in making this assessment  management relies on a number of factors to discount anticipated future cash flows including operating results  business plans and present value techniques 
rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at the relevant point in time 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 
it is possible that assumptions underlying the impairment analysis will change in such a manner that impairment may occur in the future 
valuation of plant and equipment and finite lived intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  management reviews finite lived long lived assets  primarily consisting of plant and equipment and amortized intangible assets such as acquired recipes  customer lists and non compete agreements  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable 
intangible assets with finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives 
the estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset is based upon a number of factors  including the effects of demand  competition  and future cash flows 
for these assets  if the total expected future undiscounted cash flows from the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value of the carrying value of the asset group 
the impairment tests require management to estimate the undiscounted cash flows and fair value of the asset groups 
as of december   the net book value finite lived intangible assets were million 
when analyzing finite  long lived assets for potential impairment  significant assumptions are used in determining the undiscounted cash flows of the asset group  including the cash flows attributed to the asset group  future cash flows of the asset group  including estimates of future growth rates  and the period of time in which the assets will be held and used 
the company primarily determines fair values of the asset group using discounted cash flow models 
in addition  to estimate fair value management is required to estimate the discount rate that incorporates the time value of money and risk inherent in future cash flows 
impairment of finite lived and indefinite lived intangible assets in the third quarter of  it was determined that the identifiable intangible assets of casual gourmet foods including customer relationships  recipes and processes  non competition agreements  and trade name were impaired as their undiscounted cash flows were insufficient to recover the carrying value 
accordingly  the impairment charge was measured in accordance with sfas as the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the respective assets 
the company s impairment evaluations were performed with the assistance of an independent valuation firm 
the evaluations of both goodwill and other intangible assets included reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections and were based on estimates of projected future cash flows 
casual gourmet foods experienced lower than anticipated sales during the third quarter of  due to a significant reduction in sales to its two largest customers 
these estimates assume that casual will be able to maintain its current  but reduced distribution 
these estimates of future cash flows are based upon the company s experience  historical trends  estimates of future profitability and economic conditions 
future estimates of profitability and economic conditions require estimating such factors as sales growth  employment rates and the overall economics of the retail food industry for five to ten years in the future  and are therefore subject to variability  are difficult to predict and in certain cases  beyond the company s control 
the assumptions utilized by management were consistent with those developed in conjunction with the company s long range planning process 
if the assumptions and projections underlying these evaluations are not achieved  or should the company ultimately adopt and pursue different long range plans  the amount of the impairment could be adversely affected 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that there will not be additional impairment charges in the future based on future events and that the additional charges would not have a materially adverse impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the fair value of casual gourmet foods for purposes of the intangible assets impairment test was estimated primarily using a discounted cash flow model based on the company s internal plans related to the future cash flows of casual gourmet foods primary assets 
the evaluation used a discount rate of and future cash flows over the life of the related intangible asset 
upon completion of step two of the impairment test  the company recorded an impairment loss of million related to customer relationships  non competition agreements  trade names  and recipes and processes  which was reflected in impairment of intangible assets on the company s statement of operations 
the decline in the fair value of casual gourmet foods was principally due to reductions in sales to its two largest customers 
as a result of this impairment charge to the intangible assets  when testing goodwill impairment for the reporting unit under sfas  the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value 
accordingly step of the goodwill impairment test passed and there was no goodwill impairment
