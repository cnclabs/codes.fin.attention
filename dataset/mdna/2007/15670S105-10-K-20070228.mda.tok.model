item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of cenveo  inc  which we refer to as cenveo  and its subsidiaries should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
certain statements we make under this item constitute forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of see cautionary statements regarding forward looking statements in item and risk factors in item a 
introduction and executive overview we are a leading provider of print and visual communications  with one stop services from design through fulfillment 
our broad portfolio of services and products include commercial printing  envelopes  labels  packaging  and business documents  delivered through a network of production  fulfillment and distribution facilities throughout north america 
we operate in two complementary segments envelopes  forms and labels and commercial printing 
envelopes  forms and labels 
our envelopes  forms and labels segment specializes in the manufacturing and printing of customized envelopes for billing and remittance and direct mail advertising 
this segment also produces business forms and labels  custom and stock envelopes and mailers generally sold to third party dealers such as print distributors  office products suppliers  office products retail chains and the us retail pharmacy market 
commercial printing 
our commercial printing segment is in the business of designing  manufacturing and distributing printed products that include advertising literature  corporate identity materials  financial printing  calendars  greeting cards  brand marketing materials  catalogs  maps  cd packaging and direct mail 
business strategy 
the key elements of our strategy are take actions to improve the quality and accountability of our management and employees 
our senior management team has extensive experience in the printing industry and in turning around underperforming businesses 
we also realigned our employee compensation and performance incentives with shareholder objectives 
implement cost savings programs such as the consolidation of our purchasing activities and manufacturing platform  corporate and field human resources reductions  streamlining information technology infrastructure and eliminating all discretionary spending 
since  we reduced headcount by approximately  employees and consolidated manufacturing facilities 
we believe that these programs  once fully implemented by the end of  will eliminate at least million in annual costs 
we continue to evaluate our business platform as we review acquisition opportunities 
assess our operations with a view toward eliminating operations that are not aligned with our core domestic operations or are underperforming 
for example  on march   we sold our canadian envelope operations  supremex  inc  which we refer to as supremex  and certain other assets to the supremex income fund  which we refer to as the fund  a canadian open ended trust 
in addition  in and  we sold three and six operations  respectively  that were small and not strategic to us  and closed three facilities in both years that were underperforming 
we continue to evaluate the sale or closure of facilities that no longer meet our strategic goals or performance targets 
continuously review acquisition opportunities and pursue acquisitions to diversify our product offerings and increase our economies of scale  which we believe will favorably impact our margins and profitability 
we focus on opportunities that permit us to expand our product and service offerings or achieve operating efficiencies such as increased utilization of our assets 
in july  we acquired rx technology corporation  which we refer to as rx technology  a leading manufacturer of prescription drug labels to supplement our existing label platform 
during  we fully integrated rx technology into our envelopes  forms and labels segment 
on february   we acquired pc ink corp  which we refer to as printegra  a leading producer of printed business communication documents  labels and envelopes regularly used by small and large businesses 
with the acquisition of printegra  we have increased our offering of product to our existing base of customers  by including short run documents  labels  and envelope products 
at the same time  customers of printegra are now able to access our broad offering of products and services 
in december  we entered into a definitive merger agreement with cadmus communications corporation  which we refer to as cadmus 
we believe that when fully integrated  the addition of cadmus will create significant benefits for us 
we expect to realize significant economies of scale resulting from increased volume of business and we believe that this will enable us to purchase raw materials  primarily paper and ink and other supplies  on more favorable terms and ensure better availability of these materials in tight markets 
the purchase of cadmus is subject to customary closing conditions that include  among other things  approval from cadmus shareholders and closing of our required financing 
we expect the purchase of cadmus to close in march  subject to the above closing conditions 
reduce outstanding debt and related interest expense 
as of december   we reduced our total outstanding debt by million as compared to december  we accomplished this by using a significant amount of the million of proceeds from the sale of supremex and certain other assets to pay down the entire outstanding balance of the senior secured credit facility  and another credit facility and from our debt refinancing in june in june  we entered into a new credit facility agreement that provides for million of senior secured credit facilities consisting of a million  six year revolving credit facility and a million seven year term loan facility  which we refer to as the credit facilities 
proceeds from the credit facilities and other available cash were used to fund the tender offer and extinguish approximately million in aggregate principal amount of the senior notes due or of the outstanding amount  and to retire the company s existing senior secured credit facility which had no amounts outstanding 
the cadmus and printegra acquisitions are expected to increase our revenue  earnings and cash flow along with our asset base  however  they will also increase our debt levels 
the printegra acquisition was financed using our revolving credit facility 
the cadmus acquisition is expected to be financed through an increase of our term loan  additional revolving credit facility borrowing  and the assumption of some cadmus debt  offset in part by our cash on hand  which will include million of estimated net proceeds from the sale of our remaining units in the fund 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
partner with key suppliers to improve our pricing  payment terms  and inventory management  as well as to ensure a stable source of supply 
see part item of this annual report on form k for a more complete description of our business 
consolidated operating results management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes an overview of our consolidated results for  and followed by a discussion of the results of each of our business segments for the same period 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  supremex and certain other assets has been accounted for as a discontinued operation resulting in our historical consolidated statements of operations and statements of cash flows being reclassified to reflect such discontinued operations separately from continuing operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
in addition  the cadmus and printegra acquisitions are expected to increase our revenue  earnings and cash flow in in  we continued to encounter competitive pricing pressures that result from excess capacity in the industry in concert with declining or weak volume growth in many of our markets 
in addition  the cost of paper  film and other raw materials for our products has increased 
to compete effectively in an environment of excess capacity and rising costs  we are focused on improving productivity and creating operating leverage by reducing our costs 
in  we sold three small non core printing operations  closed three printing operations and consolidated six envelope plants and two printing operations 
in  we sold three small non core printing operations  two envelope facilities and a mailing supplies business and closed three printing operations and consolidated two business forms plants and one envelope plant 
these consolidation activities have assisted us in becoming more efficient at operating our plants at higher levels of utilization 
we also continue to redeploy our assets throughout our manufacturing platform to reduce future capital expenditures 
as a result of these cost cutting initiatives  we expect our margins to continue to improve in a summary of our consolidated statement of operations is presented below 
the summary presents reported net sales and operating income loss 
see segment operations below for a summary of net sales and operating income loss of our operating segments that we use internally to assess our operating performance 
division net sales exclude sales of divested operations  and division operating income loss excludes unallocated corporate expenses  restructuring  impairment and other charges and the results of divested operations 
our fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to the last day of the calendar year  and as a result  was a week year 
because our business tends to be slower during the holiday season  we do not believe the rd week had a significant impact  unless otherwise noted  on the comparability of our results in with  which was a week year

 accounting for income taxes  which we refer to as sfas we considered our recent operating results and anticipated taxable income in assessing the need for our valuation allowance 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of  we adjusted our valuation allowance to reflect the realizability of deferred tax assets

as of december   approximately of our outstanding debt was subject to fixed interest rates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
as of february   we had million outstanding under our new revolving credit facility  of which approximately million was used to fund the acquisition of printegra 
on june   we completed a tender offer and consent solicitation  which we refer to as the tender offer  for any and all of our senior notes due and extinguished approximately million in aggregate principal amount approximately of the outstanding amount that were tendered and accepted for purchase under the terms of the tender offer 
on june   we entered into a credit agreement that provides for million of senior secured credit facilities with a syndicate of lenders  which we refer to as the credit facilities 
the credit facilities consist of a million six year revolving credit facility  which we refer to as the revolving credit facility  and a million seven year term loan facility  which we refer to as the term loan 
the credit facilities contain customary financial covenants  including maintenance of a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio 
borrowing rates under the credit facilities are determined at our option at the time of each borrowing and are based on the london interbank offered rate  libor  or the prime rate publicly announced from time to time  in each case plus a specified interest rate margin 
the credit facilities are secured by substantially all of our assets 
we used proceeds from the credit facilities and other available cash to fund the tender offer  to retire our existing senior secured credit facility due which had no amounts outstanding  and for million of debt issuance costs 
during june  we entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge interest rate exposure for million notional amount of our floating rate debt 
this hedge of the interest rate risk was designated and documented at inception as a cash flow hedge

as of december   we had outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of approximately million related to performance and payment guarantees 
in addition  we had an outstanding letter of credit of million issued in support of other debt 
based on our experience with these arrangements  we do not believe that any obligations that may arise will be significant 
our current credit ratings are as follows caption senior corporate credit senior subordinated rating agency rating facilities notes notes last update standard poor s b b nr b february moody s b ba b b february in connection with cenveo s december agreement to acquire cadmus for approximately million  and the subsequent acquisition of printegra  the rating agencies identified above affirmed the corporate rating of cenveo in february additionally  moody s and s p assigned ratings of ba and b respectively to the credit facilities that will be used to finance the cadmus acquisition 
the terms of our existing debt do not have any rating triggers that impact our funding 
we are currently engaged in obtaining debt financing  the terms of which are still to be finalized  that will augment cash on hand and proceeds from the sale of our remaining units in the fund which will be used to finance the acquisition of cadmus 
we do not believe that our current ratings will impact our ability to raise the additional capital needed to fund the acquisition 
we expect that internally generated cash flow following the consummation of the cadmus acquisition and the financing available under our credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs and long term growth  however  this cannot be assured 
as of december   the company was in compliance with all covenants under its debt agreements 
on february   we completed the acquisition of all of the common stock of printegra for approximately million in cash  which was funded through our revolving credit facility 
printegra generates annual revenues of approximately million and operates thirteen strategically located facilities in the us printegra produces printed business communication documents  including laser cut sheets  envelopes  business forms  security documents  and labels  which are regularly consumed by small and large businesses 
on december   cenveo and cadmus  signed a definitive merger agreement whereby cenveo will acquire of the outstanding stock of cadmus for per share 
cadmus is a provider of end to end integrated graphic communications services to professional publishers  not for profit societies and corporations as well as a leading provider of specialty packaging and related marketing materials for corporations 
the acquisition of cadmus will be financed with additional term loan facilities  incremental borrowings on our existing revolving credit facility  assumption of some of cadmus existing debt and cash on hand  which will include the proceeds from the sale of our remaining units in the fund 
on february   we agreed to sell our remaining units in the fund and expect to receive net estimated proceeds of million in march the company s existing credit facilities will be amended in conjunction with the cadmus acquisition and the related financing 
we expect to close the cadmus acquisition in march  pending cadmus shareholder approval 
the acquisition of cadmus will make cenveo the third largest diversified printing company in north america  which will allow us to offer our respective customers a broader set of products and services in attractive niche markets 
in december  we amended our million senior secured credit facility at no cost to us  reducing borrowing spreads to the underlying market rates and lowering associated facility fees 
the amendment also lowered the borrowing availability amount that would trigger the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant 
in  a group of shareholders called for a special meeting of shareholders to elect a new board of directors 
on september   the shareholder group and the board of directors of the company reached an agreement pursuant to which the then current board of directors approved a reconstituted board of directors and simultaneously a new chairman and chief executive officer was appointed effective september  in light of the then current board of director s approval of the successor members of the board  the transition did not constitute a change of control under our debt agreements 
as of december   we had outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of approximately million related to performance and payment guarantees 
in addition  we had an outstanding letter of credit of million issued in support of other debt 
off balance sheet arrangements 
it is not our business practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements 
accordingly  as of december  and  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
guarantees 
in conjunction with the sale of the prime label business in may  we guarantee a lease obligation that expires in april at december   the contingent liability under the guarantee was million 
we have not made  nor do we expect to make  any payments under this guarantee 
in connection with the disposition of certain operations  we have indemnified the purchasers for certain contingencies as of the date of disposition 
we have accrued the estimated probable cost of these contingencies 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions in applying our critical accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis based on historical experience and on various other factors which we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
we believe that the following represent our more critical estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements allowance for losses on accounts receivable 
we maintain a valuation allowance based on the expected collectibility of our accounts receivable  which requires a considerable amount of judgment in assessing the current creditworthiness of customers and related aging of past due balances 
as of december  and  the allowance provided for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable was million and million  respectively 
charges for bad debts recorded to the statement of operations were million in  million in and million in we cannot guarantee that our current credit losses will be consistent with those in the past 
these estimates may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have overstated or understated the allowance for losses required for uncollectible accounts receivable 
provision for impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of specific assets or group of assets may not be recoverable 
when an evaluation is required  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows associated with the specific asset or group of assets 
if the cost of the asset or group of assets cannot be recovered by these undiscounted cash flows  an impairment charge would be recorded 
our estimates of future cash flows are based on our experience and internal business plans 
our internal business plans require judgments regarding future economic conditions  product demand and pricing 
during  and  in connection with our restructuring program  we recorded impairment charges  net on long lived assets of million  million and million  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
although we believe our estimates are appropriate  significant differences in the actual performance of an asset or group of assets may materially affect our evaluation of the recoverability of the asset values currently recorded 
additional impairment charges may be necessary in future years 
provision for impairment of goodwill 
we evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill in the fourth quarter each year and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred 
determining whether an impairment has occurred requires the valuation of each of our reporting units  which we estimate using either discounted cash flows or comparative market multiples 
in preparing projected future cash flows  we use our judgment in projecting the profitability of our reporting units  their growth in future years  investment and working capital requirements and the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
in our comparisons to market multiples of other similar companies  we use judgment in the selection of the companies included in the analysis 
we currently believe there is no impairment of our goodwill  however  if our estimates of the valuations of our reporting units prove to be inaccurate  an impairment charge could be necessary in future years 
self insurance reserves 
we are self insured for the majority of our workers compensation costs and group health insurance costs  subject to specific retention levels 
we rely on claims experience and the advice of consulting actuaries and administrators in determining an adequate liability for self insurance claims 
our self insurance workers compensation liability is estimated based on reserves for claims that are established by a third party administrator 
the estimate of these reserves is increased to reflect the estimated future development of the claims 
our liability for workers compensation claims is the estimated total cost of the claims on a fully developed basis discounted based on anticipated payment patterns 
as of december   the undiscounted liability was million and the discounted liability was million using a discount rate 
workers compensation expense incurred in  and was million  million and million  respectively  and were based on an actuarial estimates 
our self insured healthcare liability represents our estimate of claims that have been incurred but not reported as of december  we rely on claims experience and the advice of consulting actuaries to determine an adequate liability for self insured plans 
this liability was million and million as of december  and  respectively  and was estimated based on an analysis of actuarial completion factors that estimated incurred but unreported liabilities derived from the historical claims experience 
our liability as of december  decreased from the prior year  primarily due to the significant reduction in our workforce 
the estimate of our liability for employee healthcare represents approximately days of unreported claims 
while we believe that the estimates of our self insurance liabilities are reasonable  significant differences in our experience or a significant change in any of our assumptions could materially affect the amount of workers compensation and healthcare expenses we have recorded 
accounting for income taxes 
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate which includes the us and canada 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
the tax effects of these temporary differences are recorded as deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded an expense in our consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax items that have been deducted for tax purposes  but have not yet been recorded as an expense in our consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we had net deferred tax assets of million from our us operations 
as of december  and  we had foreign net deferred tax liabilities of million and million  respectively 
we assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and  to the extent recoverability does not satisfy the more likely than not recognition criteria under sfas  record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we considered our recent operating results and anticipated taxable income in assessing the need for our valuation allowance 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of  we adjusted our valuation allowance to reflect the realizability of deferred tax assets 
for  we decreased our valuation allowance by approximately million  primarily as a result of utilizing our net operating loss carryforwards principally against the gain on sale of supremex and certain other assets  which is reflected in discontinued operations 
during  due to insufficient positive evidence substantiating recoverability  we increased our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets to million 
this resulted from new management determining that it would no longer implement prior identified tax planning strategies 
accordingly  in  we increased the valuation allowance by million  which included million relating to the tax benefit from stock based compensation 
the remaining portion of our valuation allowance will be maintained until there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that our remaining deferred tax assets will be realized 
when sufficient positive evidence occurs  our income tax expense will be reduced to the extent we decrease the amount of our valuation allowance 
the increase or reversal of all or a portion of our tax valuation allowance could have a significant negative or positive impact on future earnings 
any reversal of the valuation allowance related to stock based compensation will be reflected as a component of shareholders equity and will not affect the future effective income tax rate 
our policy is to establish a tax contingency liability for potential tax issues 
a tax contingency liability is based on our estimate of whether it is probable additional taxes will be due in the future 
as of december  and  we had future tax contingency liabilities of million and million  respectively  recorded in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
new accounting pronouncements we are required to adopt certain new accounting pronouncements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item in this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks such as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates  which may adversely affect results of operations and financial position 
risks from interest rate fluctuations and changes in foreign currency exchange rates are managed through normal operating and financing activities 
we do not utilize derivatives for speculative purposes 
exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our variable rate debt obligations 
the interest on this debt is the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin 
at december   we had variable rate debt outstanding of million 
a increase in libor on debt outstanding subject to variable interest rates would increase our annual interest expense and reduce our net income by approximately million 
we have operations in canada  and thus are exposed to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the canadian dollar 
for the year ended december   a uniform strengthening of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar would have resulted in a decrease in sales and operating income of approximately million and million  respectively 
the effects of foreign currency exchange rates on future results would also be impacted by changes in sales levels or local currency prices
