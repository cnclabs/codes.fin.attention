item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document 
glossary of terms in analyzing and discussing our business  we utilize certain metrics  ratios and other terms that are defined in the glossary of terms  which is located at the end of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview strategy our strategy centers on strengthening and growing our retail business and leveraging that growth in our institutional business 
we strive to further develop our retail business by acquiring  expanding and retaining our relationships with global retail customers 
we offer our retail and institutional customers a suite of investing  trading  banking and lending products 
we plan to grow those relationships organically by using technology to deliver an attractive combination of product  service and price to the value driven mass affluent customer 
we also intend to grow  where appropriate  through targeted acquisitions which leverage our existing business platform and through further expansion into certain international markets 
as we expand our global customer base  and increase the retail customer cash and credit products we hold on our balance sheet  we believe that our business will benefit 
as our institutional business manages our balance sheet on an enterprise wide basis  we become less dependent on revenue from market driven customer trading activity  and our income  while still positioned to benefit from a strong equity market  becomes more recurring in nature 
as a result  net operating interest income has become our leading category of revenue  and we anticipate this trend will continue 
key factors affecting financial performance our financial performance is affected by a number of factors outside of our control  including customer demand for financial products and services  competitors pricing on financial products and services  interest rates and the shape of the interest rate yield curve  and the performance  volume and volatility of the equity and capital markets 
in addition to the items noted above  our success in the future will depend upon  among other things continuing our success in the acquisition  growth and retention of customers  deepening customer acceptance of our investing  trading  banking and lending products  including e trade complete  disciplined expense control and improved operational efficiency  maintaining strong overall asset quality  and prudent risk and capital management 

table of contents management monitors a number of metrics in evaluating the company s performance 
the most significant of these are shown in the table and discussed in the text below at or for the year ended december  variance vs 
customer activity metrics retail client assets dollars in billions customer cash and deposits dollars in billions daily average revenue trades average commission per trade products per customer company financial metrics net revenue growth enterprise net interest spread basis points enterprise interest earning assets average in billions operating margin compensation and benefits as a of revenue customer cash and deposits  as well as retail client assets  have been re presented to account for a methodology change in the metric to settlement date from trade date reporting as of december  which reduced both metrics by million 
this is not a methodology change in accounting policy and does not impact the reporting of these items on our balance sheet 
revenue growth is the difference between the current and prior comparable period total net revenue divided by the prior comparable period total net revenue 
customer activity metrics retail client assets are an indicator of the value of our relationship with the customer 
an increase in retail client assets generally indicates that the use of our products and services by existing and new customers is expanding 
changes in this metric are also driven by changes in the valuations of our customers underlying securities 
customer cash and deposits are an indicator of a deepening engagement with our customers and a key driver of net operating interest income 
daily average revenue trades darts are the predominant driver of commission revenue from our retail customers 
average commission per trade is impacted by the mix between our retail domestic and international businesses and the mix between active traders  mass affluent and main street customers 
this metric is an indicator of changes in our customer mix  product mix and or product pricing 
products per customer is an indicator of our customer engagement and how well our suite of products and services appeal to our customer base 
we believe increases to this measure represent better overall customer engagement with our products and services 
company financial metrics net revenue growth is an indicator of our overall financial well being and our ability to execute on our strategy 
when coupled with operating margin  the two provide information about the general success of our business 
enterprise net interest spread is a broad indicator of our ability to generate net operating interest income 
enterprise interest earning assets are an indicator of our ability to generate net operating interest income  and growth in these assets  in conjunction with net operating interest spread  indicates our ability to grow net operating interest income 

table of contents operating margin is an indicator of the profitability of our operations

in recent periods  we have grown our revenue faster than our compensation expense 
this ratio coupled with operating margin is an indictor of our increasing efficiency 
significant events in harrisdirect and brownco customer conversions we converted harrisdirect and brownco customers to the e trade financial platform in the first and second quarters of  respectively  which was a key step in the integration of our newly acquired customer base

introduction of e trade complete we launched e trade complete  which offers consumers tools to aid in the optimization of investing  cash management and lending products 
e trade complete tools initially included the cash optimizer  the intelligent investing optimizer and the intelligent lending optimizer

using a token based security solution provides an added layer of security at their point of access to the internet to safeguard their personal financial information

total net revenue net income diluted net earnings per share net operating interest income after provision for loan losses operating margin operating margin during the year ended december   we continued to strengthen our operating and financial performance 
total net revenue increased and net income increased when compared to we believe this increase was driven both by our acquisitions of harrisdirect and brownco in the fourth quarter of  as well as by our ability to grow customer cash and deposits  loans including margin receivables and darts 
the growth in customer cash and deposits and total enterprise interest earning assets  including margin receivables  were the primary drivers of our increase in net operating interest income  and the growth in darts was the primary driver of our increase in commission revenue 
we were able to achieve this growth while increasing our operating margin to from when compared to the prior year 
we believe this growth in operating margin reflects increasing efficiencies in our operations 
net operating interest income after provision for loan losses increased to  million for the year ended december   compared to and now represents of total net revenue 
net operating interest income benefited from increases in customer cash and deposits coupled with growth in enterprise interest earning assets 
customer cash and deposits  our lowest cost sources of funds  increased billion compared to the increase in customer cash and deposits resulted from organic growth  which we believe is a result  in part  of the intelligent cash optimizer within e trade complete  which continues to drive growth in customer cash and deposit balances

total assets total enterprise interest earning assets average loans  net and margin receivables as a percentage of enterprise interest earning assets average retail deposits and free credits as a percentage of enterprise interest bearing liabilities the table data on average enterprise interest earning assets  loans  net and margin receivables  retail deposits and free credits has been prepared on the same basis as our disclosures with respect to the bank under the sec s industry guide  statistical disclosure by bank holding companies 
the increase in total assets was attributable primarily to increases of billion in loans  net and billion in available for sale mortgage backed and investment securities 
the increase in loans  net was due principally to growth in our real estate loan portfolio 
we continue to focus our efforts on growing our residential mortgage loan portfolios  including one to four family and home equity loans  and allowing our consumer loan portfolio to decline 
average enterprise interest earning assets increased by billion in compared to  which was related primarily to the increase in average loans  net and margin receivables 
retail deposits and free credits were billion  up or billion during the increase related to the harrisdirect conversion  as well as organic growth in checking  money market and certificate of deposit accounts 
retail deposits and free credits are two of our lowest cost sources of funding and are important contributors to our net operating interest income growth 
in addition to acquired customer growth  we experienced organic growth which we believe is a result  in part  of the e trade complete intelligent cash optimizer  as well as an overall focus on price  functionality and service for our global retail customers 
earnings overview compared to net income from continuing operations increased to million for compared to we experienced strong growth in customer cash and deposits as well as in darts 
we also experienced growth in customer margin balances

we believe this growth in operating margin is reflective of increasing efficiencies in our operations 
during  we modified the format of our consolidated income statement to a format that we believe provides a clearer picture of our financial performance and is more consistent with the common presentation found in the financial services industry 
we re ordered the revenue section by placing net operating interest income  which we previously referred to as net interest income  first  and non interest income second 
in addition  we updated our expense presentation to eliminate the remaining bank brokerage lines 
in conjunction with this change  we created a new expense category  clearing and servicing 
this new category includes trade clearing related expense  previously included in commissions  clearance and floor brokerage  and most expenses previously included in servicing and other banking expenses 
we also consolidated fair value adjustments of financial derivatives into the other expense category 
information related to fair value adjustments of financial derivatives is detailed in note accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities to the consolidated financial statements 
in particular  we report corporate interest income and corporate interest expense separately from operating interest income and operating interest expense 
we believe reporting these two items separately provides a 
table of contents clearer picture of the financial performance of our operations than would a presentation that combined these two items 
our operating interest income and operating interest expense is generated from the operations of the company and is a broad indicator of our success in our banking  lending and balance sheet management businesses 
our corporate debt  which is the primary source of our corporate interest expense  has been used primarily to finance acquisitions  such as harrisdirect and brownco  and generally has not been downstreamed to any of our operating subsidiaries 
similarly  we report gain on sales and impairment of investments separately from gain on sales of loans and securities  net 
we believe reporting these two items separately provides a clearer picture of the financial performance of our operations than would a presentation that combined these two items 
gain on sales of loans and securities  net are the result of activities in our operations  namely our lending and balance sheet management businesses 
gain on sales and impairment of investments relates primarily to historical equity investments of the company at the corporate level and is not related to the ongoing business of our operating subsidiaries

table of contents despite the flat to inverted yield curve during the period  enterprise net interest spread increased by basis points to in  compared to this increase was primarily the result of our ability to grow low cost deposits and free credits during these periods  which in turn funded our growth in loans  net and margin receivables 
average enterprise interest earning assets increased to billion for  compared to average loans  net and margin receivables grew to billion for compared to average loans  net increased as a result of our focus on growing mortgage loan products 
the margin receivable portfolio grew  in part  as a result of our acquisitions of harrisdirect and brownco  as well as organic growth

average retail deposits and free credits increased to billion for compared increases in average retail deposits and free credits were driven by our acquisitions of harrisdirect and brownco in the fourth quarter of  as well as by organic growth 
our interest rate risk is impacted by external factors such as the level and shape of the interest rate yield curve  the impact of the competitive environment on our pricing and customer behavior 
we utilize interest rate derivatives to manage this risk 
in recent years  we have managed our interest rate risk to achieve a minimum to moderate risk profile with limited exposure to earnings volatility resulting from interest rate fluctuations 
operating interest income and operating interest expense reflect income and expense on hedges that qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no

provision for loan losses provision for loan losses decreased to million for compared to the decrease in the provision for loan losses was related primarily to a lower provision for our consumer loan portfolio in connection with the decline in the overall size of the consumer loan portfolio 
we expect our provision to increase  however  as we grow our mortgage portfolio at a higher growth rate than the decline in the consumer loan portfolio 

table of contents commission retail and institutional commission revenue increased to million for compared to the primary factors that affect our commission revenue are darts and average commission per trade  which is impacted by both trade types and the mix between our domestic and international businesses 
each business has a different pricing structure  unique to its customer base and local market practices  and as a result  a change in the relative numbers of executed trades in these businesses impacts average commission per trade 
each business also has different trade types eg equities  options  fixed income  etfs  cfds and mutual funds that can have different commission rates 
as a result  changes in the mix of trade types within either of these businesses may impact average commission per trade 
darts increased to  for compared to our us dart volume increased from  driven by both our acquisitions of brownco and harrisdirect as well as organic customer growth and engagement 
our international darts grew by compared to  driven entirely by organic growth 
our international operations continue to be a strong growth contributor within our retail trading business  and we believe that over time it will become a significant component of our entire business 
in addition  option related darts further increased as a percentage of our total us darts and now represent of trading volume versus a year ago 
average commission per trade decreased to for compared to the decrease was primarily a function of the mix of customers 
main street investors  who generally have a higher commission per trade  traded less during the period which resulted in a heavier weighting of active traders  who generally have a lower commission per trade 
service charges and fees service charges and fees increased to million for compared to the the increase in service charges and fees for was due primarily to an increase in the advisory service fee income 
this increase was offset by a decrease in account maintenance fees as our retail customers became more engaged and a greater number of customers exceeded the minimum activity levels required to avoid account maintenance fees 
we expect our account maintenance fee income to continue to decline over time  however  we expect our advisory service fee income  which is not currently a significant portion of service charges and fees  to increase over time as we focus on growing this product 
principal transactions principal transactions increased to million for compared to the increase in principal transactions resulted from higher trading volumes and market volatility which were offset slightly by a decrease in the average revenue earned per trade 
our principal transactions revenue is influenced by overall trading volumes  the number of stocks for which we act as a market maker  the trading volumes of those specific stocks and the performance of our proprietary trading activities

the gains losses associated with our retail segment were reclassified to discontinued operations and the amounts related to our institutional segment remained in continuing operations 
the decline in the total gain on sales of loans and securities  net during was due primarily to our lower sales of mortgage and consumer loans compared to we retained a greater number of originated mortgage loans on the balance sheet in an effort to retain the customer relationship and drive growth in net operating interest income 
the decline in gain on sales of consumer loans was also due in part to the sale of our consumer finance business in the increase in gain on sales of securities  net resulted from higher security sales volumes in compared to other revenue other revenue increased to million for compared to the increases were the result of higher payment for order flow from improved option and equity trading volumes  offset by decreases in proprietary fund revenue relating to the closure of certain of our proprietary funds

the increase in total assets at december  compared to december  was primarily the result of growth in loans receivable  net and available for sale mortgage backed and investment securities 
the growth in loans receivable  net was the result of our continued focus on growing our residential mortgage loan portfolios  including one to four family mortgages and home equity loans 
the growth in available for sale mortgage backed and investment securities was due primarily to the growth in our asset backed securities portfolio 

table of contents the increase in total liabilities at december  compared to december  was attributable primarily to a billion increase in deposits 
the increase in deposits was due to higher sweep deposit accounts and money market deposits resulting  in part  from our conversion of harrisdirect customers during the first quarter of  as well as from organic growth from existing and new customers 
the increase in deposits was partially offset by declines in securities sold under agreements to repurchase and corporate debt

we anticipate that our mortgage and heloc portfolios will continue to increase over time  and we believe this will improve our credit risk profile 
we anticipate that recreational vehicle and marine loan balances will continue to decline over time due to our sale of consumer finance corporation in  and automobile loans will continue to decline due to our exit of the automobile origination business in commercial loans increased to million at december  compared to december  allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is management s estimate of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
the estimate of the allowance for loan losses is based on a variety of factors  including the composition and quality of the portfolio  delinquency levels and trends  probable expected losses for the next twelve months  current and historical charge off and loss experience  current industry charge off and loss experience  the condition of the real estate market and geographic concentrations within the loan portfolio  the interest rate climate as it affects adjustable rate loans  and general economic conditions 
determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio  in light of the factors then prevailing  may result in significant changes in the allowance for loan losses in future periods 
in general  we believe the 
table of contents allowance for loan losses should be equal to at least twelve months of probable projected losses for all loan types 
we believe this level is representative of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
in determining the allowance for loan losses  we allocate a portion of the allowance to various loan products based on an analysis of individual loans and pools of loans 
however  the entire allowance is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
the following table presents the allowance for loan losses by major loan category dollars in thousands consumer other real estate total allowance allowances as of consumer and other loans receivable allowance allowances as of real estate loans receivable allowance allowances as of total loans receivable december  december  the following table provides an analysis of the allowance for loan losses for the past five years dollars in thousands year ended december  allowance for loan losses  beginning of period provision for loan losses allowance acquired through acquisitions charge offs real estate heloc  heil and other recreational vehicle marine commercial credit card automobile other total charge offs recoveries real estate heloc  heil and other recreational vehicle marine commercial credit card automobile other total recoveries net charge offs allowance for loan losses  end of period net charge offs to average loans receivable  net outstanding acquisition of credit card portfolios in and and the consumer finance corporation portfolio in

losses are recognized when it is probable that a loss will be incurred 
our policy is to charge off closed end consumer loans when the loan is days delinquent or when we determine that collection is not probable 
for first lien mortgages  a charge off is recognized when we foreclose on the property 
for revolving loans  our policy is to charge off loans when collection is not probable or the loan has been delinquent for days 
during  the allowance for loan losses increased by million from the level at december  the increase was due primarily to growth in the real estate loan portfolio  which increased approximately billion over the same period and is not indicative of a decline in our overall credit standards 
the allowance increased by million related to the growth of the real estate portfolio 
offsetting this increase was a decrease in the allowance for loan losses of million related to the decline in the size of the consumer loan portfolio 
net charge offs for the year ended compared to increased by million 
the overall increase was due to higher net charge offs on real estate loans offset by lower net charge offs on consumer loans 
the increase in real estate loan charge offs was due to the growth of the portfolio and the decrease in consumer loan charge offs was due primarily to a decline in loan balances as we exited the consumer finance business in annualized net charge offs as a percentage of average loans receivable  net were at december  compared to at december  
table of contents nonperforming assets we classify loans as nonperforming when full and timely collection of interest or principal becomes uncertain or when they are days past due

in  nonperforming loans were not tracked as held for investment versus held for sale  as such  this metric is not available 
we expect nonperforming loan levels to fluctuate over time due to portfolio growth  portfolio seasoning and resolution through collections  sales or charge offs 
the performance of any loan can be affected by external factors  such as economic conditions or factors particular to the borrower 
during  our nonperforming assets  net increased million from million at december  the increase was attributed to an increase in nonperforming real estate loans and reo and other repossessed assets  net of million and an increase in nonperforming consumer and other loans of million 
these trends are not the result of a deterioration or improvement in credit quality  but are reflective of our targeted growth in real estate loans and the targeted decrease in consumer loans 
the allowance as a percentage of total nonperforming loans receivable  net decreased from in to in as our loan portfolio shifts to mortgage loans  where the risk of charge off is generally less than the risk of charge off on a consumer loan  the level of the allowance to nonperforming assets may continue to decrease 
in addition to nonperforming assets in the table above  we monitor loans where a borrower s past credit history casts doubt on the borrower s ability to repay a loan  whether or not the loan is delinquent special mention loans 
special mention loans represented million  or  and million  or  of the total loan portfolio at december  and  respectively 
these loans are actively monitored  continue to accrue interest and remain a component of the loans receivable balance 
the increase in special mention loans was due primarily to an increase in the day delinquency category of mortgage loans 
significant migration from this category to more serious delinquency classifications is not expected to occur
