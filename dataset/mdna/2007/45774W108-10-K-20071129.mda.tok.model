you should carefully read the cautionary note regarding forward looking statements and risk factors in this form k 
overview following our exit from the industrial wire business see note to the consolidated financial statements  our operations are entirely focused on the manufacture and marketing of concrete reinforcing products for the concrete construction industry 
the results of operations for the industrial wire business have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
our business strategy is focused on achieving leadership positions in our markets and operating as the lowest cost producer  and pursuing growth opportunities within our core businesses that further our penetration of current markets served or expand our geographic reach 
critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements 
the preparation of our financial statements requires the application of these accounting principles in addition to certain estimates and judgments based on current available information  actuarial estimates  historical results and other assumptions believed to be reasonable 
actual results could differ from these estimates 

table of contents the following critical accounting policies are used in the preparation of the financial statements revenue recognition and credit risk 
we recognize revenue from product sales in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
when products are shipped and risk of loss and title has passed to the customer 
substantially all of our accounts receivable are due from customers that are located in the united states and we generally require no collateral depending upon the creditworthiness of the account 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our assessment of the credit risk of specific customers  historical trends and other information 
there is no disproportionate concentration of credit risk 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to change significantly  adjustments to the allowances may be required 
while we believe our recorded trade receivables will be collected  in the event of default in payment of a trade receivable  we would follow normal collection procedures 
excess and obsolete inventory reserves 
we write down the carrying value of our inventory for estimated obsolescence to reflect the lower of the cost of the inventory or its estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions for our products are substantially different than our projections  adjustments to these reserves may be required 
accruals for self insured liabilities and litigation 
we accrue estimates of the probable costs related to self insured medical and workers compensation claims and legal matters 
these estimates have been developed in consultation with actuaries  our legal counsel and other advisors and are based on our current understanding of the underlying facts and circumstances 
because of uncertainties related to the ultimate outcome of these issues as well as the possibility of changes in the underlying facts and circumstances  adjustments to these reserves may be required in the future 
recent accounting pronouncements

fin no 
is effective for us beginning in fiscal and requires that the cumulative effect of applying its provisions be disclosed separately as a one time  non cash charge against the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption 
based on our preliminary analysis  the adoption of fin no 
is expected to result in an estimated charge to retained earnings of approximately  the actual amount of the adjustment will be recorded in the first quarter of upon the finalization of our analysis

shipments for the year decreased while average selling prices rose from the prior year 
the reduction in shipments was driven by a combination of factors including the continuation of weak demand and inventory reduction measures pursued by customers that have been negatively impacted by the downturn in residential construction activity  our decision to solicit minimal new business from posttension customers in the pc strand market due to low priced import competition  and less favorable weather conditions in certain of our markets relative to the prior year which reduced the level of construction activity

the increase in shipments was primarily due to the continued improvement in nonresidential construction activity and demand for our concrete reinforcing products together with the completion of the inventory reduction measures pursued by customers during the prior year 
the decrease in average selling prices was due to competitive activity in our markets which was offset by reductions in raw material costs 
gross profit gross profit increased to million  or of net sales in from million  or of net sales in the increase in gross profit was driven by higher shipments together with wider spreads between average selling prices and raw material costs

under variable plan accounting  compensation expense was recognized for the excess of the market price over the exercise price and adjusted to reflect changes in market valuation 
as a result  total stock based compensation expense for amounted to  comprised of  of stock option expense resulting from the increase in our share price that occurred during and  of restricted stock amortization

in  the net change in receivables  inventory and accounts payable and accrued expenses used million of cash while providing million and million in and  respectively 
the cash used by working capital in the current year was primarily due to the million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses resulting from the sharp reduction in raw material purchases during the fourth quarter together with changes in the mix of vendor payment terms 
depreciation and amortization rose million  or  primarily due to the increase in capital expenditures during the current and prior years and related asset additions

investing activities of continuing operations used million of cash in compared with million in and million in capital expenditures amounted to million  million and million in  and  respectively  with the higher levels in the current and prior years primarily related to capital outlays for the expansions of the esm and pc strand businesses 
capital expenditures are expected to be million in primarily related to the upgrading of our florida pc strand facility 
the actual timing of these expenditures as well as the amounts are subject to change based on adjustments in the project timelines or scope  future market conditions  our financial performance and additional growth opportunities that may arise 
in  we sold an idle facility which had been classified as assets held for sale and realized net proceeds of  investing activities from discontinued operations did not provide or utilize cash in while providing million in from the net proceeds on the sale of certain machinery and equipment associated with our discontinued industrial wire business

no borrowings were outstanding on the credit facility as of september  and september  and outstanding letters of credit totaled million and million  respectively 
as of september   million of borrowing capacity was available on the credit facility see note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents our balance sheet was debt free as of september  and september  we believe that  in the absence of significant unanticipated cash demands  net cash generated by operating activities and amounts available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our expected requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  dividends and share repurchases  if any

outlook we expect continued growth in nonresidential construction  our primary demand driver  in  but at a reduced rate from the elevated levels of recent years 
the outlook for commercial construction has weakened due to the ongoing housing downturn and recent tightening in the credit markets 
however  other segments within nonresidential construction are expected to remain strong supported by higher spending for infrastructure related construction associated with the recently enacted federal transportation funding authorization  the improved fiscal positions of most states and the heightened focus on addressing the critical infrastructure needs that exist  and post hurricane reconstruction in the gulf region of the us at the same time  the drop off in residential construction is expected to continue through  which will adversely affect shipments to customers that have greater exposure to the housing sector 
we now believe that a recovery in the housing market is unlikely to occur until sometime in  although the exact timing remains highly uncertain 
in addition  increasing imports of pc strand and escalating raw material costs could compress margins depending upon the strength of demand  competitive dynamics and our ability to recover these additional costs in our markets 
despite these near term challenges  we expect gradually increasing contributions during from the substantial investments that have been made in our facilities over the past two years to expand and reconfigure our tennessee pc strand facility  add new esm production lines in our north carolina and texas plants and a new standard welded wire reinforcing line at our delaware facility  and upgrade our florida pc strand operation which is expected to be completed in the third quarter of as we ramp up production on the new equipment  we anticipate dual benefits in the form of reduced operating costs and additional capacity to support future growth 
in addition to these organic growth and cost reduction initiatives  we are continually evaluating potential acquisitions in our existing businesses that further our penetration in current markets served or expand our geographic reach 
we anticipate that these actions  together with the positive overall outlook for our nonresidential construction related markets  should have a favorable impact on our financial performance in see cautionary note regarding forward looking statements and risk factors 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
we manage our exposure to these market risks through internally established policies and procedures and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and we are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
we monitor our underlying market risk exposures on an ongoing basis and believe that we can modify or adapt our hedging strategies as necessary 
commodity prices we have not generally used derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposures to changes in commodity prices 
our principal commodity price exposure is hot rolled carbon steel wire rod  our primary raw material  which we purchase from both domestic and foreign suppliers and is denominated in us dollars 
prior to  we typically negotiated quantities and pricing on a quarterly basis for both domestic and foreign steel wire rod purchases to manage our exposure to price fluctuations and to ensure adequate availability of material consistent with our requirements 
however  beginning in  a tightening of supply in the rod market together with fluctuations in the raw material costs of rod producers resulted in increased price volatility which has continued through in some instances  wire rod producers have resorted to increasing the frequency of price adjustments  typically on a monthly basis as well as unilaterally changing the terms of prior commitments 
our ability to acquire steel wire rod from foreign sources on favorable terms is impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  foreign taxes  duties  tariffs and other trade actions 
although changes in wire rod costs and our selling prices may be correlated over extended periods of time  depending upon market conditions  there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover increased rod costs through higher selling prices  which reduces our gross profit and cash flow from operations 
interest rates although we were debt free as of september   future borrowings under our senior secured credit facility are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
foreign exchange exposure we have not typically hedged foreign currency exposures related to transactions denominated in currencies other than us dollars and any such transactions have not been material in the past 
we will occasionally hedge firm commitments for equipment purchases that are denominated in foreign currencies 
the decision to hedge any such transactions is made by us on a case by case basis 
there were no forward contracts outstanding as of september
