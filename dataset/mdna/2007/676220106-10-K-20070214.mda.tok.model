item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations general our fiscal year results are based on a or week retail calendar ending on the last saturday in december 
fiscal years and include weeks  fiscal year is based on weeks  with a week fourth quarter 
our comparable store sales or comp sales relate to stores that have been open for at least one year 
for  this comparison has been adjusted to a week basis 
overview fiscal year has been a year of growth across the company 
we have exceeded billion in sales for the first time by increasing sales levels in each of our operating divisions  even when compared to a week year in on a comparable week basis  these sales increases are even greater 
also  full year division gross profit and division operating profit increased in north america and international 
these results were realized at the same time as opening new stores and remodeling another stores in north america  investing in our contract sales force in north america and europe and expanding our geographic presence with acquisitions in north america  europe and asia 
major contributors to our results are summarized below and reviewed further in the segment discussions 
excluding the rd week from  total company sales increased compared to north american retail division comp store sales grew 
during  we refined our measure of division operating profit to include general and administrative expenses directly or closely attributable to each reportable segment and to exclude charges related to programs initially identified in following a company wide review of operations  processes and commitments the charges 
these charges will continue to be recognized in future periods as the plans are implemented and the related accounting criteria are met 
also  we continue to explore ways to enhance our financial reporting and may refine presentation or allocations in future periods 
diluted earnings per share for  and were  and  respectively 
the charges had a per share impact in and a per share impact in the positive impact of the rd week on net earnings was approximately per diluted share 
in the fourth quarter of  we recognized a gain on building sale after debt termination of approximately per share 
we also recorded a charge to settle litigation of approximately per share 
after considering the impact of the charges  building gain and legal settlement  our operating expenses as a percent of sales declined as a result of various cost control efforts  operational improvements and improved leverage from higher sales 
during  we acquired all or a majority interest in certain entities headquartered in south korea  north america  the czech republic and china  and increased our previous investment to a majority position in an entity in israel 
results of those entities have been consolidated in our financial statements since the dates of acquisition 
cash flow from operating activities was million in and totaled billion over the past three year period 
under plans approved by our board of directors  we acquired million shares of our common stock during the year 
operating results our overall sales increased in both and however  was a week year based on our fiscal calendar 
on a comparable week basis  fiscal sales increased  compared to an increase of in each of our divisions reported higher sales in on both a comparable week basis and when compared to the week period in the sales increase in reflects positive organic growth  the impact of acquisitions during the year and positive foreign currency impacts in our international division 
the increase reflects higher sales in our north american operations  partially offset by a decline in the international division from reduced local currency sales 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales in reflects the net impact of higher private brand sales and better category management  partially offset by competitive pressures in certain areas and some change in product sales mix 
cost of goods sold in and include the negative impact of million and million  respectively  of inventory related charges 
total store and warehouse operating and selling expenses as a percentage of sales decreased in and increased in the and totals include charges of approximately million and million  respectively 
expenses that were similar in nature to these charges  but not part of the charges programs totaled million in after considering those charges  store and warehouse operating and selling expenses as a percent of sales decreased in both and the decrease reflects operational efficiencies and sales leverage  partially offset by higher costs from accelerated store remodel and new store opening 
table of contents activities  as well as initial costs for an expanded sales force and the integration of several acquisitions during the year 
the reductions in also reflect the success we realized in improving our advertising cost effectiveness throughout  as well as leverage from the rd week of sales 
effective with the beginning of the third quarter of  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r fas r using the modified prospective method 
under this method  the portions of previously granted share based payments that were unvested at the date of adoption  as well as the fair value of awards granted after adoption  are included in operating expenses over the appropriate service period 
discussion of other income and expense items  including the charges and changes in interest and taxes follows our review of the operating segments 
as noted above  during  we modified our presentation of division operating profit by including general and administrative expenses considered directly or closely attributable to each reportable segment and excluding the charges recognized during the period to conform to the internal presentation used to manage the business 
north american retail division dollars in millions sales change division operating profit of sales total sales in the north american retail division increased in and compared to the prior periods 
however  sales increased over the prior year after consideration of the impact of the additional week in comp store sales in from the  stores that were open for more than one year increased 
comp store sales in from the stores that were open for at least one year increased 
the growth in total sales reflects our new store openings  as well improved selling efforts and effective merchandising and marketing programs 
during and  we increased our private brand offerings  continued improving the effectiveness of our inserts and advertising campaigns and maintained our official office supply partnership with nascar 
also during  we transformed our previous advantage loyalty program into our worklife tm rewards program  which has continued to promote long term customer relationships 
overall gross margins increased in and compared to the prior year 
we have expanded our selection of private brands which has had a positive impact on gross margins  and we expect to continue developing additional product offerings 
we continue to increase our mix of technology sales  which are lower margin products  but have benefited from category management and higher attachment rates 
furniture sales were lower  we believe reflecting the impact of softness in the housing market on our home office furniture sales 
our operating expenses as a percent of sales were lower in compared to  reflecting lower store operating costs  somewhat offset by higher advertising costs and our store remodeling program 
the store expansion and remodel program has impacted our operating expenses by additional pre opening expenses related to new stores  as well as accelerating depreciation for stores being remodeled and incurring non capitalizable remodeling costs 
we exclude the brief remodel period from our comp sales calculation to account partially for some of the disruption 
the new store and store remodel activity lowered the division operating profit percentage by approximately basis points in compared to we opened new stores during and stores during  all using our improved m store design 
at the end of  we operated  retail stores in the us and canada 
we anticipate opening approximately stores in and additional stores in we also remodeled stores during and stores in we have a goal of remodeling substantially all remaining stores over the next two years 
north american business solutions division dollars in millions sales change division operating profit of sales 
table of contents sales in our north american business solutions division increased in both and however  sales increased over the prior year after consideration of the impact of the additional week in the sales increase in reflects organic growth in our contract sales channel  as well as the impact of an acquisition completed in mid may sales in our contract channel also increased in compared to as we added sales force and made changes in account management 
the increase in reflects broad based revenue growth 
during  we began offering a combined catalog to the previously separate office depot and viking catalog customers and completed that integration in as expected  direct channel sales were lower in following the conversion as we deliberately reduced some unprofitable business  and we anticipate lower comparisons until about mid year when the impact of this combined offering is reflected in both periods 
gross margin in this division declined in compared to  reflecting paper cost increases and a higher mix of contract business  partially offset by additional private brand offerings 
operating expenses increased from our investment in additional sales personnel  as well as short term costs related to the integration of a contract business acquired during the year and the outsourcing of telephone account management and a new delivery initiative 
we expect the impact of these costs to moderate during the first half of as these activities mature and costs for incremental activities are captured in both periods 
during and  our lower delivery expenses were partially offset by higher fuel costs 
during  we reorganized our sales force and decided to consolidate our call centers and outsource certain activities  that process was completed in the third quarter of and had a positive impact on subsequent operating expenses 
international division dollars in millions sales change division operating profit of sales sales in our international division increased in and declined in however  local currency sales increased over the prior year after consideration of the impact of the additional week in the increase in sales in reflects improved performance in all channels and the impact of acquisitions 
during  we acquired all or a majority interest in entities headquartered in south korea  the czech republic and china  and increased our previous investment to a majority position in an entity in israel 
results of those entities have been consolidated in our financial statements since the dates of acquisition 
the sales decline in compared to reflects competitive pressures in both the contract and catalog channels and challenging economic conditions in many western european countries 
also in  we closed the contract business in one country as well as retail stores  contributing to the sales decline 
gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased slightly in  but stabilized in the later half of the year  after a more significant decline in the decrease reflects the addition of lower margin business  as well as an increase in the relative proportion of contract sales  partially offset by increased private brand sales 
the decrease reflects competitive pressures in important product categories across channels and the impact of increased contract sales 
operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased in compared to reflecting operational efficiencies from streamlining activities initiated in and continuing in during  we have increased the size of our contract sales force across europe and increased the use of telephone account managers to drive account penetration 
operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased slightly in compared to  primarily reflecting reduced leverage from lower sales 
for us reporting  the international division s sales are translated into us dollars at average exchange rates experienced during the year 
the division s sales were positively impacted by foreign currency exchange rates in by million  and were negatively impacted in by million 
division operating profit was also positively impacted from changes in foreign exchange rates by million in  and negatively by million in internally  we analyze our international operations in terms of local currency performance to allow focus on operating trends and results 

table of contents corporate and other asset impairments  exit costs and other charges during the third quarter of  we announced a number of material charges relating to asset impairments  exit costs and other operating decisions 
this announcement followed a wide ranging assessment of assets and commitments which began in the second quarter of at the end of  we estimated the total charges to be incurred over a multi year period would be approximately million 
we have since revised that estimate to be approximately million 
of this amount  million was recognized in and million was recognized in we estimate that million and million will be recognized in and  respectively 
the expenses associated with these future activities will be recognized as the individual plans are implemented and the related accounting recognition criteria are met 
as with any estimate  the amounts may change when expenses are incurred 
these business reviews were performed at a division level and initially we reported the charges associated with these activities as a component in determining division operating profit 
the financial information used by our management to assess performance of the divisions for the purpose of resource allocation now excludes the charges 
we believe this measure is an appropriate and useful indicator of the effectiveness of current management activities 
accordingly  we have revised our measure of division operating profit for external reporting purposes and now report on the charges at a corporate level 
prior period division operating profit has been recast to conform to the current presentation 
a summary of the charges and the line item presentation of these amounts in our accompanying consolidated statements of earnings is as follows 
dollars in millions  except share amounts amounts amounts cost of goods sold and occupancy costs store and warehouse operating and selling expenses asset impairments general and administrative expenses total pre tax charges income tax effect after tax impact per share impact of the million pre tax charge recognized in  approximately million related to asset impairments  approximately million of exit costs and approximately million of costs associated with termination agreements relating to contracts and surplus leases  accelerated amortization of software and depreciation of assets based on changes in estimated useful lives and the write off of certain property and inventory no longer used or useful based on this business review 
the asset impairment charge of million included million related to certain former kids r us kru retail store locations acquired in from toys r us  inc the performance of many of these locations did not meet initial projections to recover the initial asset base 
we also recognized a million goodwill and other intangible asset charge related to our tech depot subsidiary 
a change in market conditions for technology products and a shift in that subsidiary s emphasis resulted in lowering our projected cash flows and goodwill was written down to estimated fair value 
also  as part of this business review and to streamline operations  we decided to migrate customers from the guilbert trade name to office depot 
the existing trade name intangible asset was tested for impairment and written down by approximately million to the amount that we estimated to be recoverable over the one year migration plan 
the kru  tech depot and trade name impairment charges are combined in the consolidated statement of earnings on the line item titled asset impairments 
following the fourth quarter review of goodwill and intangible assets in  we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million related to our investment in japan 
because of its nature  that charge has been presented on this same line for comparative purposes  but was not part of the charges programs 
in addition to these significant asset impairment charges  we also recognized significant charges related to exit and other activities 
the total exit and other charges recorded in and anticipated for future periods will be discussed below  as well as where the charges appear in the consolidated statement of earnings 

table of contents we decided to close retail stores in north america and nine internationally  three warehouses two in north america and one internationally and consolidate certain international call center and contract operations 
accordingly  we recognized approximately million of charges for future lease obligations  severance related costs  accelerated depreciation  asset write offs and inventory clearance and disposal 
of this total  approximately million of inventory related costs were recognized in cost of goods sold  approximately million in store and warehouse operating and selling expenses and approximately million in general and administrative expenses 
in addition to these exit costs  we recognized approximately million of other charges 
we terminated certain contractual agreements and adjusted surplus lease property accruals  wrote down and accelerated depreciation on assets based on a decrease in their expected use and accelerated inventory clearance activity in preparation of implementing a new inventory management system 
of this total  approximately million was presented as a charge in cost of goods sold  approximately million in store and warehouse operating and selling expenses and approximately million in general and administrative expenses 
during  an additional million associated these projects was recognized as the previously identified plans were implemented and the related accounting recognition criteria were met 
these projects primary related to consolidating and streamlining activities and resulted in charges for severance related expenses  accelerated depreciation and amortization and other expenses 
of this total  approximately million was recognized in cost of goods sold  approximately million in store and warehouse operating and selling expenses  million in asset impairments related to additional kru properties and million in general and administrative expenses 
some of these activities  such as planned facility closings  will extend into and the costs associated with these activities will be recognized in future periods as incurred  or in the case of asset utilization  over the period of remaining estimated useful life 
a summary of past and estimated future charges is presented below 
estimated total dollars in millions actual actual charges asset impairments cost of goods sold asset write offs and accelerated depreciation lease obligations contract terminations one time termination benefits other associated costs total pre tax charges as with any estimate  the timing and amounts may change when projects are implemented 
additionally  changes in foreign currency exchange rates may impact amounts reported in us dollars related to our foreign operations 
of the total charges  approximately million either has or is expected to require cash settlement  including longer term lease obligations that will require cash over multi year lease terms  approximately million of charges are non cash items 
general and administrative expenses dollars in millions general and administrative expenses of sales general and administrative g a expenses include charges of approximately million in and million in additionally in  we recognized a charge of approximately million as an agreement in principle to settle wage and hour litigation in california 
g a expenses in include approximately million of executive and staff severance  dispute resolutions  loss on disposal of property and lease termination costs associated with property used in g a functions 
after considering these charges  the remaining change in total g a expenses in compared to reflects the positive impacts of various cost control measures and consolidating functions 
g a expenses in compared to benefited from lower professional fees and the effect of cost control measures  partially offset by increases from the adoption of fas r and acceleration of certain variable pay and restricted stock awards earned in 
table of contents during  we decided to allocate to our divisions those g a expenses that are directly or closely related to their operations 
those amounts are now included in our determination of each division s operating profit 
we have recast prior periods for meaningful comparisons 
other companies may charge more or less g a expenses and other costs to their segments  and our results therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities 
gain on sale of building in december  we sold our corporate campus and entered into a leaseback agreement until construction of our new facility is complete 
the sale resulted in a gain of approximately million recognized in and million deferred over the leaseback period 
we have also entered into a longer term lease on a new facility nearby that is expected to be available for occupancy at or about the end of other income and expense dollars in millions interest income interest expense loss on extinguishment of debt miscellaneous income  net interest income decreased in as a result of lower average cash balances  partially offset by higher interest rates 
the change in compared to reflects modestly higher interest rates 
the increase in interest expense in compared to primarily results from the reduction of interest requirements following the favorable settlement of various tax claims 
the comparison to also reflects the impact of our redemption in december of the entire issue of the million senior subordinated notes 
the loss on extinguishment of debt in represents the million make whole payment related to settlement of the mortgage on our corporate campus that was sold during the year 
the net loss on extinguishment of debt of million for included the make whole payment  write off of deferred issuance costs  and recognition of a previously deferred gain related to an interest rate swap 
our net miscellaneous income consists of our earnings of joint venture investments  royalty and franchise income  and realized gains and impairments of other investments  if any 
our investments are non controlling interests in office depot stores outside north america 
earnings from these investments increased million in and million in we increased our ownership interest in office depot israel during and have consolidated its results since the date of additional investment 
we continue to look for ways to expand our presence overseas and may enter into additional ventures or increase our investment in existing positions which could result in additional entities being consolidated in future periods 
income taxes dollars in millions income taxes effective income tax rate income taxes as a percentage of earnings from continuing operations before income taxes 
the effective income tax rate increased in  reflecting a greater impact in the prior year from closing certain worldwide tax audits and adjusted provisions for uncertain tax positions 
fiscal year also benefited from lower net international tax expense and is more in line with our anticipated base effective tax rate of approximately for during  we also adjusted certain valuation allowances based on our current assessment of realization of the related deferred tax assets 
this decrease was partially offset by additional tax expense from completing our plans to repatriate additional foreign earnings 
during  we recognized tax expense related to our preliminary assessment of foreign earnings to be repatriated in under the provisions of the american jobs creation act 
we also recognized tax benefits from reducing existing valuation allowances on deferred tax assets  from audit settlements and from the release of previously recorded accruals for uncertain tax positions based on changes in the facts and circumstances 

table of contents the effective tax rate in future periods can be affected by variability in our mix of income  the tax rates in various jurisdictions  changes in the rules related to accounting for income taxes  outcomes from tax audits that regularly are in process and our assessment of the need of accruals for uncertain tax positions  and therefore may be higher or lower than it has been over the past three years 
the financial accounting standards board has approved new rules applying to the accounting for uncertain tax positions 
these rules become effective in the first quarter of we do not anticipate that adoption of these rules will have a material impact on our retained earnings at the date of adoption but could introduce additional volatility into our effective income tax rate in future periods 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity we have consistently satisfied operating liquidity needs and planned capital expenditure programs through our normal conversion of sales to cash 
over the three years ended in  we generated approximately billion of cash flows from operating activities 
at december   we had approximately million in cash and equivalents and another million available under our revolving credit facility

also  we will continue to look outside the company for additional growth opportunities  as well as consider additional share repurchases 
we continually review our financing options 
although we currently anticipate that we will fund our operations  expansion and other activities through cash on hand  funds generated from operations  property and equipment leases and funds available under our credit facilities  we may consider alternative financing as appropriate for market conditions

while our board of directors regularly assesses our dividend policy  there are no current plans to declare a dividend 
cash provided by used in our operating  investing and financing activities is summarized as follows dollars in millions operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities the change in cash flow from operating activities during reflects increased contribution from the core business and positive impacts of working capital management 
throughout the year  we have worked to collect our cash more timely and to better align trade payables with inventory turnover 
the change in cash flows from operating activities during reflects increased business performance after considering non cash elements of the charges and non cash equity compensation  offset by the reduction of trade payables and payment of taxes 
following our adoption of fas r in the third quarter of  the presentation of tax benefits received from the exercise of stock options in excess of the tax benefit on their estimated fair value has changed from a component of operating activities to a component of financing activities in the statement of cash flows 
operating cash flow in includes the impact of higher accounts receivable balances from increased fourth quarter sales activity  as well as an increase in receivables

see note f of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our deferred tax positions and note h for a discussion of our employee benefit plans  including the pension plans and the deferred compensation plan 
in addition to the above  we have letters of credit totaling million outstanding at the end of the year  and we have recourse for private label credit card receivables transferred to a third party 
we record a fair value estimate for losses on these receivables in our financial statements 
the total outstanding amount transferred to a third party at the end of the year was approximately million 
we have no other off balance sheet arrangements other than those disclosed in the contractual obligations table 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparation of these statements requires management to make judgments and estimates 
some accounting policies have a significant impact on amounts reported in these financial statements 
a summary of significant accounting policies can be found in note a in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have also identified certain accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and we have provided below additional information on those policies 
vendor arrangements each year  we enter into purchase arrangements with many of our vendors that provide for those vendors to make payments to us if and when certain conditions are met 
we generally refer to these arrangements as vendor programs  and they typically fall into two broad categories  with some underlying sub categories 
the largest category is volume based rebates 
generally  our product costs per unit decline as higher volumes of purchases are reached 
many of our vendor agreements provide that we pay higher per unit costs prior to reaching a predetermined milestone  at which time the vendor rebates the per unit differential on past purchases  and also applies the lower cost to future purchases until the next milestone is reached 
current accounting rules provide that companies with a sound basis for estimating their full year purchases  and therefore the ultimate rebate level  can use that estimate to value inventory and cost of goods sold throughout the year 
we believe our history of purchases with many vendors provides us with a sound basis for our estimates 
if the anticipated volume of purchases is not reached  however  or if we form the belief at any given point in the year that it is not likely to be reached  cost of goods sold and the remaining inventory balances are adjusted to reflect that change in our outlook 
we review sales projections and related purchases against vendor program estimates at least quarterly and adjust these balances accordingly 
the second category of arrangements we have with our vendors is event based programs 
these arrangements can take many forms  including advertising support and specific promotional activities 
these advertising arrangements generally are classified as a reduction of product costs  reducing costs of goods sold and inventory 
event based arrangements include special pricing offered by certain of our vendors for a limited time  payments for special placement or promotion of a product  reimbursement of costs incurred to launch a vendor s product  and various other special 
table of contents programs 
these payments are classified as a reduction of costs of goods sold or inventory  as appropriate for the program 
additionally  we receive payments from vendors for certain of our activities that lower the vendor s cost to ship their product 
such receipts are recognized as a reduction of our cost of goods sold 
while vendor rebates are recognized throughout the year based on judgment and estimates  the final amounts due from vendors are generally known soon after year end 
substantially all vendor program receivables outstanding at the end of the year are collected within the three months immediately following year end 
we believe that our historic collection rates of these receivables provide a sound basis for our estimates of anticipated vendor payments throughout the year 
inventory valuation our selling model is predicated on the breadth and availability of our product assortment  and our profitability is impacted by inventory turnover rates 
we monitor inventory on hand by location  particularly as it relates to trailing and projected sales trends 
when slow moving inventory is identified  or we decide to discontinue merchandise  we review for estimated recoverability and  if necessary  record a charge to reduce the carrying value to our assessment of the lower of cost or market 
this assessment is based on the quantity of the merchandise  the rate of sale  and our assessment of market conditions 
additional cost adjustments and sales markdowns will be taken as considered appropriate until the product is sold or otherwise disposed 
estimates and judgments are required in determining what items to stock and at what level  and what items to discontinue and how to value them prior to sale 
intangible asset testing absent any circumstances that warrant testing at another time  we test for goodwill and non amortizing intangible asset impairment as part of our year end closing process 
our goodwill testing consists of comparing the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units to their carrying amounts  including recorded goodwill 
we estimate the fair values of each of our reporting units by discounting their projected future cash flows 
developing these future cash flow projections requires us to make significant assumptions and estimates regarding the sales  gross margin and operating expenses of our reporting units  as well as economic conditions and the impact of planned business or operational strategies 
should future results or economic events cause a change in our projected cash flows  or should our operating plans or business model change  future determinations of fair value may not support the carrying amount of one or more of our reporting units  and the related goodwill would need to be written down to an amount considered recoverable 
any such write down would be included in the operating expenses 
we recognized goodwill and intangible asset impairments in both and while we make reasoned estimates of future performance  actual results below these expectations  or changes in business direction can result in additional impairment charges in future periods 
closed store reserves and asset impairments we regularly assess the performance of each retail store against historic patterns and projections of future profitability 
these assessments are based on management s estimates for sales growth  gross margin attainments  and cash flow generation 
if  as a result of these evaluations  management determines that a store will not achieve certain targets  we may decide to close the store 
when a store is no longer used for operating purposes  we recognize a liability for the remaining costs related to the property  reduced by an estimate of any sublease income 
the calculation of this liability requires us to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding the remaining term of the lease including vacancy period  anticipated sublease income  and costs associated with vacating the premises 
with assistance from independent third parties to assess market conditions  we periodically review these judgments and estimates and adjust the liability accordingly 
we adjusted the carrying value of some of these obligations as part of the charges 
future fluctuations in the economy and the market demand for commercial properties could result in material changes in this liability 
costs associated with facility closures are included in store and warehouse operating expenses 
in addition to the decision about whether or not to close a store  store assets are regularly reviewed for recoverability of their carrying amounts 
the recoverability assessment requires judgment and estimates of a store s future cash flows 
new stores may require years to develop a customer base necessary to achieve expected cash flows and we typically do not test for impairment during this early stage 
however  if in subsequent periods  the anticipated cash flows of a store cannot support the carrying amount of the store s assets  an impairment charge is recorded to operations as a component of store and warehouse operating and selling expenses 
to the extent that management s estimates of future performance are not realized  future assessments could result in material impairment charges 
as discussed above  the charges recorded in and include significant impairment charges 
income taxes income tax accounting requires management to make estimates and apply judgments to events that will be recognized in one period under rules that apply to financial reporting and in a different period in the company s tax returns 
in particular  judgment is required when estimating the value of future tax deductions  tax credits  and net operating loss carryforwards nols  as represented by deferred tax assets 
when we believe the recovery of all or a portion of a deferred tax asset is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
generally  changes in judgments that increase or decrease these valuation allowances impact current earnings 
decreases in valuation allowances associated with nols acquired in a business combination reduce goodwill 

table of contents in addition to judgments associated with valuation accounts  our current tax provision can be affected by our mix of income and identification or resolution of uncertain tax positions 
because income from domestic and international sources may be taxed at different rates  the shift in mix during a year or over years can cause the effective tax rate to change 
we base our rate during the year on our best estimate of an annual effective rate  and update those estimates quarterly 
we file our tax returns based on our best understanding of the appropriate tax rules and regulations 
however  complexities in the rules and our operations  as well as positions taken publicly by the taxing authorities may lead us to conclude that accruals for uncertain tax positions are required 
we generally maintain accruals for uncertain tax positions until examination of the tax year is completed by the taxing authority  available review periods expire  or additional facts and circumstances cause us to change our assessment of the appropriate accrual amount 
the financial accounting standards board has issued new accounting rules relating to uncertain tax positions that will be applied beginning in the first quarter of significant trends  developments and uncertainties over the years  we have seen continued development and growth of competitors in all segments of our business 
in particular  mass merchandisers and warehouse clubs  as well as grocery and drugstore chains  have increased their assortment of home office merchandise  attracting additional back to school customers and year round casual shoppers 
recently  warehouse clubs have added to their in store assortment by adding catalogs and websites from which a much broader assortment of products may be ordered 
we also face competition from other office supply superstores that compete directly with us in numerous markets 
this competition is likely to result in increased competitive pressures on pricing  product selection and services provided 
many of these retail competitors  including discounters  warehouse clubs  and drug stores and grocery chains  carry basic office supply products 
some of them also have begun to feature technology products 
many of them price certain of these offerings lower than we do  but they have not shown an indication of greatly expanding their somewhat limited product offerings at this time 
this trend towards a proliferation of retailers offering a limited assortment of office products is a potentially serious trend in our industry 
we have also seen growth in competitors that offer office products over the internet  featuring special purchase incentives and one time deals such as close outs 
through our own successful internet and business to business web sites  we believe that we have positioned ourselves competitively in the e commerce arena 
another trend in our industry has been consolidation  as competitors in office supply stores and the copy print channel have been acquired and consolidated into larger  well capitalized corporations 
this trend towards consolidation  coupled with acquisitions by financially strong organizations  is potentially a significant trend in our industry 
we regularly consider these and other competitive factors when we establish both offensive and defensive aspects of our overall business strategy and operating plans 
market sensitive risks and positions we have market risk exposure related to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
market risk is measured as the potential negative impact on earnings  cash flows or fair values resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates over the next year 
we manage the exposure to market risks at the corporate level 
the portfolio of interest sensitive assets and liabilities is monitored and adjusted to provide liquidity necessary to satisfy anticipated short term needs 
our risk management policies allow the use of specified financial instruments for hedging purposes only  speculation on interest rates or foreign currency rates is not permitted 
interest rate risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes on cash equivalents and debt obligations 
the impact on cash and short term investments held at the end of from a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would be a decrease in interest income of less than million 

table of contents market risk associated with our debt portfolio is summarized below carrying fair risk carrying fair risk dollars in thousands value value sensitivity value value sensitivity million senior notes revolving credit facility the risk sensitivity of fixed rate debt reflects the estimated increase in fair value from a basis point decrease in interest rates  calculated on a discounted cash flow basis 
the sensitivity of variable rate debt reflects the possible increase in interest expense during the next period from a basis point change in interest rates prevailing at year end 
foreign exchange rate risk we conduct business in various countries outside the united states where the functional currency of the country is not the us dollar 
our expansion in europe in recent years increased our operations in countries with euro and british pound functional currencies 
we continue to assess our exposure to foreign currency fluctuation against the us dollar 
as of december   a change in the applicable foreign exchange rates would result in an increase or decrease in our operating profit of approximately million 
although operations generally are conducted in the relevant local currency  we also are subject to foreign exchange transaction exposure when our subsidiaries transact business in a currency other than their own functional currency 
this exposure arises primarily from a limited amount of inventory purchases in a foreign currency 
the notional amount of foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain inventory exposures were million at their highest point during also  from time to time we enter into foreign exchange forward transaction to protect against possible changes in exchange rates related to scheduled or anticipated cash movements among our operating entities 
generally  we evaluate the performance of our international businesses by focusing on the local currency results of the business  and not with regard to the translation into us dollars  as the latter is impacted by external events 
inflation and seasonality although we cannot determine the precise effects of inflation on our business  we do not believe inflation has had a material impact on our sales or the results of our operations 
we consider our business to be only somewhat seasonal  with sales in our north american retail division slightly lower during the second quarter 
certain working capital components may build and recede during the year reflecting established selling cycles  but we do not consider the company to be highly seasonal
