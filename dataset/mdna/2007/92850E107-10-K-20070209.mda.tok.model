moreover  the legacy business units within the us central states and canada grew revenue 
intermodal service issues that impacted growth in the canadian national line of business for the previous two years were not factors in and the canadian business unit posted historical growth rates

accordingly  the company s consolidated operating ratio improved to in from in detailed explanations for the improvements in revenue and income from operations are discussed below in segmented results 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased to million in from million in the increase in sg a expenses for the year can primarily be attributed to the addition of ctl on may  contributing to the remainder of the increase were increases in non cash employee stock options expense  corporate advertising expense  director compensation  sg a headcount within the logistics group  and salary and wage increases across all segments of the company

interest expense net of interest income was million for compared to million for this increase was due to the acquisition of ctl on may  that consumed the majority of the company s interest generating short term investments

revenue increased to million in compared to million in  driven by the acquisition of ctl on may  and the absence of a cn strike that persisted for five weeks in and corresponding intermodal capacity issues that persisted through the balance of these intermodal capacity issues that affected canadian ltl long haul operations were not as severe in  but a non unionized port of vancouver drayage driver work stoppage negatively offset revenue increases by million 
notwithstanding this  the ltl segment recorded revenue increases throughout the canadian and us infrastructure in all lines of business regional  national  expedited and  most notably  a increase in transborder revenue 
a firm pricing environment within the ltl segment  the acquisition of ctl and a stable economy led to increased shipments  tonnage and revenue per hundredweight of  and  respectively

notwithstanding this  income from operations improved to million in compared to million in and the ltl segment operating ratio improved to compared to in 
table of contents logistics revenue and income from operations for the logistics segment were up and for compared to revenue increases were attributable to improvements coming from the brokerage and supply chain business units 
although shipments for declined compared to in the brokerage unit  this was more than offset by a increase in revenue per shipment for in the supply chain business unit  revenue growth outpaced income from operations increases in as the business unit filled the capacity of the toronto distribution facility that was opened in also in the fourth quarter of  the supply chain business unit commenced full operations of its new western canadian dedicated distribution facility 
as a result the logistics segment improved its operating ratio to in from in truckload revenue for the truckload segment decreased to million in from million in with a strong pricing environment in the midwestern us attributable to a tight driver market that reduced capacity in the truckload market place  the company s truckload segment continued to focus on better yielding freight in consequently  revenue per total mile increased by while empty miles decreased by 
total shipments for decreased compared to  however  this was offset by the increase in revenue per shipment versus the aforementioned revenue quality development and yield progress increased gross margin to in however  offsetting these improvements was a million increase in accident costs in over these factors resulted in an operating ratio of for compared to in notes a shipment is a single movement of goods from a point of origin to its final destination as described on a bill of lading document 
weight represents the total pounds shipped by each ltl business unit 
revenue per shipment represents revenue divided by the number of shipments 
revenue per hundredweight is the price obtained for transporting pounds of ltl freight from point to point  calculated by dividing the revenue for an ltl shipment by the hundredweight weight in pounds divided by for a shipment 
revenue per total mile represents revenue divided by the total miles driven 
general risks and uncertainties the company is exposed to a number of general risks and uncertainties that could impact the results 
the transportation industry is highly competitive on the basis of both price and service 
the company competes with regional  inter regional and national ltl carriers  truckload carriers  third party logistics companies and  to a lesser extent  small package carriers  air freight carriers and railroads 
the company competes effectively in its markets by providing high quality and timely service at competitive prices 
the company s business is sensitive to general economic conditions and seasonal fluctuations  although these factors are mitigated somewhat by the variable nature of many of the company s costs 
recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customer business cycles  as well as downturns in the principal regional economies where the company s operations are located may affect results of operations 
in the trucking industry for a typical year  the second and third quarters usually have the highest business levels  while the first and fourth quarters generally have the lowest business levels 
the fourth quarter holiday season and adverse weather conditions generally experienced in the first quarter of the year  such as heavy snow and ice storms  have a negative impact on operating results 
accordingly  revenue and profitability are generally lowest in the first and fourth quarters 
vitran is dependent on a major railroad for its national ltl service in canada 
any reduction in service by the railroad is likely to increase costs for the company and reduce the reliability  timeliness and overall attractiveness of rail based services 

table of contents the company s exposure to credit risk is not significant as it is not dependent on any particular industry or customer 
the company s single largest customer accounted for of revenue in the general manufacturing industry at approximately of total ltl revenue in represents the most significant industry serviced by the company 
labor represents vitran s most significant cost and key to service quality 
the company has a history of positive labor relations that will continue to be important to future success 
the two unionized terminals in canada  representing of the company s labor force  are represented by the international brotherhood of teamsters and the canadian autoworkers association 
the collective bargaining agreements between the company and its unionized employees expire on march  and on september   respectively 
the company is dependent on its ability to hire and retain qualified drivers including owner operators 
the ground transportation industry as a whole has experienced an imbalance in the number of qualified drivers for approximately the last five years 
the shortage has not significantly affected the company s ltl segment in  but should an imbalance in the number of qualified drivers persist  vitran may adjust its compensation package or operate with fewer drivers  all of which could impact profitability 
furthermore  the company is dependent on certain key management personnel for the successful operation of the business 
loss of key personnel could harm vitran s operations and financial condition 
the company has exposure to foreign currency risk as fluctuations in the us dollar against the canadian dollar can impact the financial results of the company 
management has designated the company s million of us dollar denominated long term debt as a hedge to the foreign currency exposure generated by the company s us operations 
the company s canadian operations realize foreign exchange gains and losses on the us dollar revenue generated against expenses denominated in canadian dollars 
furthermore  the company reports its results in us dollars thereby exposing the results of the company s canadian operations to foreign currency fluctuations 
while diesel fuel expenses represent an important cost component to vitran  the extensive use of owner operators and the ability to share significant fuel increases with customers in the form of a fuel surcharge reduces this risk 
the company is subject to numerous laws and regulation by the dot  environmental protection agency epa  internal revenue service  canada custom s regulation agency and various other federal  state  provincial and municipal authorities 
new or more comprehensive laws and regulation including but not limited to fuel emission  driver hours of service  taxation or other mandated regulation could impact profitability 
measures taken by the us and canadian governments to strengthen border security regulations could impact service levels 
vitran s cross border activity represented approximately of the ltl segment revenue in and the company has responded to the new requirements to ensure compliance and safety without jeopardizing the quality of service 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk at december  as a majority of its debt portfolio bears interest at floating rates 
more predominately in the past and currently  management has used fixed interest rate instruments to mitigate the exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and on an ongoing basis continues to evaluate the company s need to fix interest rates 
the company operates a highly capital intensive business 
vitran depends on operating leases  lines of credit  secured equipment financing and cash flow from operations to finance the purchase of tractors  trailing fleet  information technology hardware and terminals 
the company invests in new operating equipment and is dependent on the availability of rolling stock 
vitran s investment in rolling stock is a significant part of the annual capital expenditure expense and the supply and price of such equipment may be adversely impacted by new regulations on engines 
vitran is also dependent on the availability and price of terminal facilities 
the company is exposed to insurance and claims expenses 
vitran is exposed to claims resulting from cargo loss  auto liability and workers compensation 
if the number and severity of future claims increase it could have an impact on profitability 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash flow from operations before working capital changes for the year increased to million in compared to million in due primarily to the increase in net income 
non cash working capital changes contributed million primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable attributable to better collections in and a decrease in prepaid expenses 
the days sales outstanding was days for compared to days for on january  the company purchased all the assets and selected liabilities of swe for an aggregate purchase price of million  comprised of million in cash and note payable to the vendor in april the cash portion of the transaction was financed from existing cash on hand

at december   the company had available million of unused credit facilities  net of outstanding letters of credit 
capital expenditures amounted to million for and were primarily funded out of operating cash flows of the company 
the majority of capital expenditures in were real estate related expenditures  namely the acquisition of a logistics facility in chicago  acquisition of an ltl service centre in houston and the construction of new ltl service centers in toronto and sioux falls 
tractor  trailer and information technology additions were primarily for replacement purposes 
the table below sets forth the company s capital expenditures for the years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands of dollars real estate and buildings tractors trailing fleet information technology leasehold improvements other equipment total management estimates that cash capital expenditures  excluding real estate additions for  will be between million and million 
real estate additions  the majority of which will be for the construction of the new toronto service centre  will be approximately million 
the company also anticipates entering into operating leases to fund the acquisition of equipment with a capital cost of between million and million 
the company expects to finance its capital requirements with cash flow from operations  and if required  its million of unused credit facilities 

table of contents the company has contractual obligations that include long term debt consisting of term debt facilities  revolving credit facilities  capital leases for operating equipment and off balance sheet operating leases primarily consisting of tractor  trailing fleet and real estate leases 
operating leases form an integral part of the company s financial structure and operating methodology as they provide an alternative cost effective and flexible form of financing

the letters of credit are used as collateral for self insured retention of insurance claims 
a significant decrease in demand for our services could limit the company s ability to generate cash flow and affect its profitability 
the company s credit agreement contains certain financial maintenance tests that require the company to achieve stated levels of financial performance  which  if not achieved  could cause an acceleration of the payment schedules 
management does not anticipate a significant decline in business levels or financial performance and expects that existing working capital  together with available revolving facilities  will be sufficient to fund operating and capital requirements in as well as service the contractual obligations 
outlook fiscal  despite a slow down in the economy  was another successful year for the company 
revenue  income from operations and earnings per share were all time bests for vitran 
furthermore the company achieved its objective of expanding into new regional markets with the acquisitions of swe and pjax 
together these acquisitions added at total of service centers in california  nevada  arizona  new jersey  pennsylvania  delaware  maryland  west virginia and virginia 
the ltl segment achieved a double digit transborder growth rate and both the canadian ltl and us ltl business units improved revenue and yield 
the us ltl business unit executed an inter regional sales strategy for new southwestern and western regions and completed the it systems upgrade for swe 
the canadian ltl unit made progress on the construction of its new toronto service centre 
however  despite management efforts  the us ltl business unit did not reduce its claims costs to the desired levels in the logistics segment posted financial improvements in compared to by leveraging its existing customer base 
the truckload segment did not perform as expected  due to difficulties with driver retention in a softer than expected economy 
for  vitran s objective is still to acquire or develop its ltl operation into new regional markets 
management will continue to evaluate ltl expansion opportunities with a view to ensuring the appropriate fit to its existing ltl network 
at december   the company had million of cash and million of unused credit facilities 
management intends to continue its focus on the ltl transborder business with a view to maintaining above average year over year revenue growth 
the us ltl business unit will focus on it systems harmonization to augment its inter regional sales and operating initiatives 
completing the migration of the us ltl business unit to a common it operating system will be of paramount importance not only for inter regional sales but for linehaul optimization and the elimination of service centre and rolling stock redundancy 
the canadian ltl business unit will endeavor to complete the construction of the new toronto service centre and then focus on service center efficiencies 

table of contents the logistics segment will continue to concentrate on gaining new profitable business that also utilizes the services of the company s ltl infrastructure 
vitran management expects continued tightness in the truckload driver market  therefore  the truckload segment will focus on driver retention and margin expansion 
the truckload segment has modified its compensation package to attract qualified drivers 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company prepares its financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states together with a reconciliation to canadian gaap  as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
significant accounting policies and methods used in preparation of the financial statements are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company evaluates its estimates and assumptions on a regular basis  based on historical experience and other relevant factors 
significant estimates are used in determining  but not limited to  the allowance for doubtful accounts  claims and insurance accruals and the fair value of reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment tests 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates and assumptions 
revenue recognition the company s ltl and truckload business units and freight brokerage operations recognize revenue upon the delivery of the related freight and direct shipment costs as incurred 
revenue for the logistics operations is recognized as the management services are provided 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts related to accounts receivable that may potentially be impaired 
the allowance is based on the company s knowledge of the financial condition of its customers  the aging of the receivables  current business environment  customer and industry concentrations  and historical experience 
a change to these factors could impact the estimated allowance and the provision for bad debts recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
claims and insurance accruals claims and insurance accruals reflect the estimated ultimate total cost of claims  including amounts for claims incurred but not reported  for cargo loss and damage  bodily injury and property damage  workers compensation  long term disability and group health 
in canada the company has  cdn  and in the united states  self insurance retention sir per incident for auto liability  casualty and cargo claims 
in the united states the company has an  sir per incident for workers compensation and  sir per incident for employee medical 
in establishing these accrued expenses  management evaluates and monitors each claim individually  and uses factors such as historical experience  known trends and third party estimates to determine the appropriate reserves for potential liability 
changes in severity of previously reported claims  significant changes in the medical costs and legislative changes affecting the administration of the plans could significantly impact the determination of appropriate reserves in future periods 
goodwill and intangible assets the company performs its goodwill impairment test annually  and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have occurred 
impairment is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount to its implied fair value 
the methodology used to measure fair value is the discounted cash flow method 
the discounted cash flow method requires certain assumptions for growth in earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation  future tax rates  capital re investment  fair value of the 
table of contents assets and liabilities  and discount rate 
the discount rate is based on the company s estimated weighted average cost of capital 
actual recovery of goodwill could differ from these assumptions based on market conditions and other factors 
in the event goodwill is determined to be impaired  a charge to earnings would be required 
as at september   vitran completed its annual goodwill impairment test and concluded that there was no impairment 
the company  for the acquisitions in  allocated purchase price to intangible assets based on management s estimates 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
management establishes appropriate useful lives for all property and equipment and continuously evaluates and updates these when circumstances warrant 
actual carrying value of assets could differ based on different assumptions  estimates or other factors 
share based compensation under the company s stock option plan  options to purchase common shares of the company may be granted to key employees  officers and directors of the company and its affiliates by the board of directors or by the company s compensation committee 
the company accounts for stock options in accordance with sfas statement r with option expense amortized over the vesting period based on the black scholes morton fair value on the grant date 
the company adopted sfas r on january  and recorded million in income related to the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle
