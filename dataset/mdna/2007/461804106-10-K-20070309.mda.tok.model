title insurance through its two wholly owned subsidiaries  itic and ne itic  the company underwrites land title insurance for owners and mortgagees as a primary insurer 
itic and ne itic offer primary title insurance coverage to owners and mortgagees of real estate and reinsurance of title insurance risks to other title insurance companies 
title insurance protects against loss or damage resulting from title defects that affect real property 
the commitment and policies issued are predominantly the standard american land title association approved forms 
title insurance policies 
there are two basic types of title insurance policies one for the mortgage lender and one for the real estate owner 
a lender often requires property owners to purchase title insurance to protect its position as a holder of a mortgage loan  but the lender s title insurance policy does not protect the property owner 
the property owner needs to purchase an owner s title insurance policy to protect their investment 
title insurance policies are issued on the basis of a title report 
the title report documents the current status of title to the property 
when real property is conveyed from one party to another  occasionally there is an undisclosed defect in the title or a mistake in a prior deed  will or mortgage that may give a third party a legal claim against such property 
if a claim is made against real property  title insurance provides indemnification against insured defects 
the title insurer has the option to retain counsel and pay the legal expenses to eliminate or defend against any title defects  pay any third party claims arising from errors in title examination and recording or pay the insured s actual losses  up to policy limits  arising from title risks as defined in the policy 
a title risk is one of any number of things that could jeopardize the property owner s or mortgagee s interest in the property defined in the title policy 
such risks include title being vested in someone or some entity other than the insured  unmarketable title  lack of a right of access to the property  invalidity or unenforceability of the insured mortgage  or other defects  liens  or encumbrances against the property 
examples of the most common types of covered risks include defects arising from prior unsatisfied mortgages  tax liens or confirmed assessments  judgments against the property or encumbrances against the property arising through easements  restrictions or other existing covenants 
title insurance also generally protects against deeds or mortgages that contain inaccurate legal descriptions  that were forged or improperly acknowledged or delivered  that were executed by spouses without the other spouse s signature or release of marital interest or that were conveyed by minors or incompetents

for a description of the level of net premiums written geographically by state  refer to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the annual report of shareholders incorporated by reference in this form k annual report 
each state license authorizing itic or ne itic to write title insurance must be renewed annually 
these licenses are necessary for the companies to operate as a title insurer in each state in which they are held 
reinsurance 
the company assumes and cedes reinsurance with other insurance companies in the normal course of business 
reinsurance is a contractual arrangement whereby one insurer assumes some or all of the risk exposure written by another insurer 
ceded reinsurance is comprised of excess of loss treaties  which protects against losses over certain amounts 
in the ordinary course of business  itic and ne itic reinsure certain risks with other title insurers for the purpose of limiting their risk exposure and to comply with state insurance regulations 
they also assume reinsurance for certain risks of other title insurers for which they receive additional income 
for the last three years  reinsurance activities accounted for less than of total premium volume 
the company s reinsurance policy is more restrictive than state regulators require 
as of december   state insurance regulators set a maximum risk retention limit for itic 
itic set its own risk retention limit at  meaning that it limited the net loss on primary risks up to  it then reinsured the next  of risk with ne itic  and all risks above  were ceded to an unrelated reinsurer pursuant to an automatic treaty 
ne itic set its risk retention limit at  meaning that it limited the net loss on primary risks up to  it then reinsured the next  of risk with itic  and all amounts above  were ceded to an unrelated reinsurer pursuant to an automatic treaty 
both itic s and ne itic s risk retention limits are self imposed and are more conservative than state insurance regulations require 
itic s self imposed retention of  is only of its statutorily permitted retention of  ne itic s self imposed retention of  is only of its statutorily permitted retention of ratings 
the company s title insurance subsidiaries are regularly assigned ratings by independent agencies to indicate their financial condition 
itic has been recognized by two independent fannie mae approved actuarial firms  demotech  inc and lace financial corporation  with rating categories of a double prime and a 
ne itic s financial stability also has been recognized by demotech  inc and lace financial corporation with rating categories of a double prime and a 
according to demotech  title insurance underwriters earning a financial stability rating of a a double prime possess unsurpassed financial stability related to maintaining positive surplus as regards policyholders  regardless of the severity of a general economic downturn or deterioration in the title insurance cycle 
a lace rating of a or a indicates that a title insurance company has a strong overall financial condition that will allow it to meet its future claims and that  generally  the company has good operating earnings  is well capitalized and has adequate reserves 
exchange services in  the company established investors title exchange corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary itec  to provide services in connection with tax deferred exchanges of like kind property pursuant to section of the internal revenue code 
itec acts as an intermediary in tax deferred exchanges of property held for productive use in a trade or business or for investments  and its income is derived from fees for handling exchange transactions and interest earned on client deposits held by the company 
in february  the irs proposed new regulations which  if adopted  may negatively affect the ability of qualified intermediaries to retain a portion of the interest earned on exchange funds held during exchange transactions 
if passed as proposed  these regulations would adversely impact the exchange services segment and the company s net income  since a significant portion of the exchange segment s revenues are based on retaining a portion of the interest income earned on deposits held 
refer to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the annual report to shareholders incorporated by reference in this form k annual report for additional information regarding irs regulations 
investors title accommodation corporation itac began serving as an exchange accommodation titleholder  offering a vehicle for accomplishing a reverse exchange when a taxpayer must acquire replacement property before selling the relinquished property 
investment management and trust services the company organized icmc  a wholly owned subsidiary  as a north carolina corporation on october  investors trust  also a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  received its north carolina trust charter on february   from the north carolina commissioner of banks 
icmc and investors trust work together to provide investment management and trust services to individuals  companies  banks and trusts 
these subsidiaries are not currently a reportable segment for which financial information is presented in the financial statements and are included and reported in a category called all other 
there is no assurance that this business will be successful 
operations of subsidiaries see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report to shareholders incorporated by reference in this form k annual report for additional information related to the company s operating segments 
title insurance itic and ne itic issue title insurance coverage through its direct operations or through partially owned or independent title insurance agents 
title insurance premiums written reflect a one time premium payment  with no recurring premiums 
generally  premiums are recorded and recognized as revenue at the time of closing of the related transaction as the earnings process is considered complete 
where the policy is issued through a title insurance agent  the agent retains a commission 
title insurance commissions earned by the company s agents are recognized as expense concurrently with premium recognition 
the percentage of the premium retained by agents varies by region to region and is sometimes regulated by the states 
for a description of the level of net premiums written by direct and agency operations  refer to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the annual report to shareholders incorporated by reference in this form k annual report 
exchange services itec and itac provide customer services in connection with tax deferred exchanges pursuant to section of the internal revenue code 
acting as a qualified intermediary  itec holds the proceeds from sales of relinquished properties until the acquisition of identified replacement properties occurs 
itac facilitates tax deferred reverse exchanges pursuant to irs revenue procedure these exchanges require itac  using funds borrowed on a non recourse basis from the customer or their lender  to acquire the designated replacement property on behalf of the customer by taking temporary title to their property until after the disposition of identified relinquished property occurs 
seasonality and cyclicality title insurance real estate activity is cyclical in nature 
title insurance premiums are closely related to the level of real estate activity and the average price of real estate sales 
the availability of funds to finance purchases directly affects real estate sales 
other factors include changes in mortgage interest rates  consumer confidence  economic conditions  supply and demand and family income levels 
historically  the winter months have the least real estate activity because fewer real estate transactions occur  while the remaining quarters are more active 
refinance activity is generally less seasonal  but it is subject to interest rate volatility 
fluctuations in mortgage interest rates also affect demand for new mortgage loans and can cause shifts in real estate activity outside of the normal seasonal pattern 
exchange services seasonal factors affecting the level of real estate activity and the volume of title premiums written will also affect the demand for exchange services 
marketing title insurance the company markets its title insurance services to a broad range of customers in the residential and commercial market sectors of the real estate industry 
itic delivers title insurance coverage through a home office  branch offices  and issuing agents 
in north carolina  itic issues policies primarily through a home office and branch offices 
the company also has a branch office in south carolina and nebraska 
itic also writes title insurance policies through issuing agents in the district of columbia and the states of alabama  arkansas  florida  georgia  illinois  indiana  iowa  kentucky  louisiana  maryland  michigan  minnesota  mississippi  missouri  nebraska  north carolina  ohio  pennsylvania  south carolina  tennessee  virginia and west virginia 
issuing agents are typically real estate attorneys or subsidiaries of community and regional mortgage lending institutions  depending on local customs and regulations and the company s marketing strategy in a particular territory 
ne itic currently operates through agency offices in the state of new york 
itic and ne itic strive to provide superior service to their customers and consider this an important factor in attracting and retaining customers 
branch and corporate personnel strive to develop new business and agency relationships to increase market share and itic s commercial services division provides services to commercial clients 
the company s marketing efforts are also enhanced through general advertising in various trade and professional periodicals 
exchange services marketing of exchange services offered by itec and itac has been incorporated into the marketing of the core title products offered by itic and ne itic 
the commercial services division of itic also markets the services offered by itec and itac to its clients 
customers the company is not dependent upon any single customer or a few customers  and the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
insured risk on policies in force generally  the amount of the insured risk or face amount of insurance on a title insurance policy is equal to the lesser of the purchase price of the insured property or the fair market value of the property 
in the event that a claim is made against the property  the insurer is also responsible for paying all legal expenses in connection with defending the insured party and eliminating any title defects affecting the property 
the insurer may  however  choose to pay the policy limits to the insured  at which time the insurer s duty to defend the claim is satisfied 
at any given time  the insurer s actual financial risk is only a portion of the aggregate insured risk of all policies in force 
the reduction in risk results in part from the reissuance of title insurance policies by other underwriters when the property is conveyed or refinanced 
the coverage on a lender s title insurance policy is reduced and eventually terminated as the mortgage loan it secures is paid 
an owner s policy is effective as long as the insured has an ownership interest in the property or has liability under warranties of title 
due to the variability of these factors  the aggregate contingent liability on outstanding policies of the company and its subsidiaries cannot be determined with any precision 
losses and reserves while most other forms of insurance provide for the assumption of risk of loss arising out of unforeseen events  title insurance is based upon a process of loss avoidance 
losses on policies typically occur when a title defect is not discovered during the examination and settlement process and the occurrence of certain hidden risks which cannot be determined from an accurate search of public land records 
the maximum amount of liability under a title insurance policy is generally the face amount of the policy plus the cost of defending the insured s title against an adverse claim 
reserves for claim losses are established based upon known claims  as well as losses incurred but not yet reported to the company based upon historical experience and other factors 
title claims can often be complex  vary greatly in dollar amounts and are affected by economic and market conditions and may involve uncertainties as to ultimate exposure  and therefore  reserve estimates are subject to variability 
environmental matters the title insurance policies itic and ne itic currently issue exclude liability for environmental risks and contamination 
although policies issued prior to may not specifically exclude such environmental risks  they generally do not provide affirmative coverage for such risks 
as a result  the company does not anticipate that it or its subsidiaries will incur any significant expenses related to environmental claims 
in connection with effecting tax deferred exchanges of like kind property  itec and itac may temporarily hold title to property pursuant to an accommodation titleholder agreement 
in such situations  the person or entity for which title is being held must execute an indemnification agreement pursuant to which it agrees to indemnify itec or itac  as appropriate  for any environmental or other claims which may arise as a result of the arrangement 
regulation title insurance the company is an insurance holding company and therefore it is subject to regulation in the states in which its insurance subsidiaries do business 
these regulations  among other things  require insurance holding companies to register and file certain reports and require prior regulatory approval of the payment of dividends and other intercompany distributions or transfers 
title insurance companies are extensively regulated under applicable state laws 
all states have requirements for admission to do business as an insurance company  including minimum levels of capital and surplus and establishing reserves 
state regulatory authorities monitor the stability and service of insurance companies and possess broad powers with respect to the licensing of title insurers and agents  approving rate schedules and policy forms  financial reporting and accounting practices  defining the types and amounts of investments  reserve requirements  and dividend restrictions  as well as examinations and audits of title insurers 
the company s two insurance subsidiaries are subject to examination at any time by the insurance regulators in the states where they are licensed 
other governmental authorities have the power to enforce state and federal laws to which the title insurance subsidiaries are subject  including the real estate settlement procedures act respa 
the national association of insurance commissioners the naic has adopted an instruction requiring an annual certification of reserve adequacy by a qualified actuary 
because all of the states in which the company s title insurance subsidiaries are domiciled require adherence to naic filing procedures  each subsidiary must file an actuarial opinion with respect to the adequacy of its reserves 
proposals to change the laws and regulations governing insurance holding companies and the title insurance industry are often introduced in congress  in the state legislatures and before the various insurance regulatory agencies 
the company regularly monitors such proposals and legislation  although the likelihood and timing of them and the impact they may have on the company and its subsidiaries cannot be determined at this time 
itic is domiciled in north carolina and is subject to north carolina insurance regulations 
the north carolina department of insurance typically schedules financial examinations every five years 
itic was last examined by the north carolina department of insurance for the period january  through december  no material deficiencies were noted in the report 
ne itic is domiciled in south carolina and subject to south carolina insurance regulations 
the south carolina department of insurance periodically schedules financial examinations 
ne itic was examined by the south carolina department of insurance for the period january  through december  no material deficiencies were noted 
in addition to financial examinations  itic and ne itic are subject to market conduct cap examinations by the north carolina department of insurance and the south carolina department of insurance  respectively 
these audits examine domiciled state activity 
itic s last market conduct examination commenced in may for the period january  through december   with no material deficiencies noted 
ne itic s last market conduct examination commenced in november for the period january  through december   with no material deficiencies noted by the market conduct examiners 
both itic and ne itic meet the statutory premium reserve requirements and the minimum capital and surplus requirements of the states in which they are licensed 
exchange services intermediary services are not federally regulated by any regulatory commissions  and neither itec nor itac operate in any states that regulate this industry 
itec and itac both provide services to taxpayers pursuant to internal revenue service irs regulations that provide taxpayers a safe harbor by using a qualified intermediary to structure tax deferred exchanges of property and using an exchange accommodation titleholder to hold property in reverse exchange transactions 
periodically  changes to the tax code provisions affecting like kind exchanges are considered  which could possibly eliminate the need for the services the exchange segment provides 
in  the irs proposed new regulations which  if adopted  may negatively affect the ability of qualified intermediaries to retain a portion of the interest earned on exchange funds held during exchange transactions 
if passed as proposed  these regulations would materially adversely impact the exchange services segment and the company s net income  since the exchange segment s revenues include a portion of the interest income earned on deposits held by the company 
a public hearing on the proposed regulations was held on june   but no official response has been issued by the irs on whether or not they plan to finalize the regulations as proposed 
investment management and trust services the investment management and trust services division is regulated by the north carolina commissioner of banks 
investors trust was last examined by the north carolina commissioner of banks for the period ended december  no material deficiencies were noted in the report of examination 
competition title insurance the title insurance industry is highly competitive 
itic currently operates primarily in kentucky  north carolina  michigan  south carolina  tennessee  virginia and west virginia and ne itic currently operates in new york 
itic s and ne itic s major competitors together comprise a majority of the title insurance market on a national level 
the number and size of competing companies varies in the different geographic areas in which the company conducts business 
key factors that affect competition in the title insurance industry are price  expertise  timeliness and quality of service and the financial strength and size of the insurer 
title insurance underwriters also compete for agents based upon the ratio of premium splits between the underwriter and the agent 
some title insurers currently have greater financial resources  larger distribution networks and more extensive computerized databases of property records and related information than the company 
in addition  there are numerous industry related regulations and statutes that set out conditions and requirements to conduct business 
changes to or the removal of such regulations and statutes could result in additional competition from alternative title insurance products or new entrants into the industry that could materially affect the company s business operations and financial condition 
exchange services competition for itec and itac comes from other title insurance companies and agents  banks  attorneys  and other independently owned qualified intermediaries that offer exchange services 
key elements that affect competition are price  expertise  timeliness and quality of service and the financial strength and size of the company 
exchange services are not a regulated industry  therefore  there is no market data available regarding the company s market position in this industry 
investment policies the company and its subsidiaries derive a substantial portion of their income from investments in bonds municipal and corporate and equity securities 
the investment policy is designed to maintain a high quality portfolio and maximize income 
some state laws impose restrictions upon the types and amounts of investments that can be made by the company s insurance subsidiaries 
the company manages its investment portfolio and does not utilize third party investment managers

item a 
risk factors the risk factors listed in this section and other factors noted herein or incorporated by reference could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
the company s results of operations and financial condition are susceptible to the changing level of demand for title insurance which is based on the level of real estate activity  the volume of mortgage refinancing transactions  changes in the requirements of lenders and other participants in the market  and other potential factors 
the demand for the company s title insurance and other real estate transaction products and services is dependent upon  among other things  the volume of commercial and residential real estate transactions and mortgage refinancing transactions 
the volume of these transactions has historically been influenced by factors such as mortgage interest rates and the state of the overall economy 
when mortgage interest rates are increasing or during an economic downturn or recession  real estate activity typically declines and the title insurance industry tends to experience lower revenues and profitability 
the cyclical nature of the company s business has caused fluctuations in revenues and profitability in the past and is expected to do so in the future 
volume is a key factor in the company s profitability due to the existence of fixed costs such as personnel and occupancy expenses associated with the support of the issuance of title insurance policies and of general corporate operations 
the volume of real estate transactions also depends in part upon the requirements of mortgage lenders and participants in the secondary mortgage market that title insurance policies be obtained on residential and commercial real property 
home sales and mortgage lending are highly cyclical businesses 
historically  real estate transactions have produced seasonal revenue levels for title insurers  with residential real estate activity generally slower in the winter  when fewer families move or buy or sell homes 
therefore  the first calendar quarter is typically the weakest quarter in terms of revenue due to the generally low volume of home sales 
fluctuations in mortgage interest rates  as well as other economic factors  can cause shifts in real estate activity outside the normal seasonal pattern 
differences between actual claims experience and underwriting and reserving assumptions may adversely affect the company s financial results 
the company s net income depends upon the extent to which its actual claims experience is consistent with the assumptions used in establishing reserves for claims 
reserves for claims are established based on estimates by an independent actuary of how much the company will need to pay for reported as well as incurred  but not yet reported claims 
in addition  management considers factors such as the company s historical claims experience  case reserve estimates on reported claims  large claims and other relevant factors in determining loss provision rates and the aggregate recorded expected liability for claims 
due to the nature of the underlying risks and the high degree of uncertainty associated with the determination of reserves for claims  the company cannot determine precisely the amounts which it will ultimately pay to settle its claims 
such amounts may vary from the estimated amounts  particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future 
to the extent that actual claims experience is less favorable than the underlying assumptions used in establishing such liabilities  the company could be required to increase reserves 
title claims can often be complex  vary greatly in dollar amounts and are affected by economic and market conditions and may involve uncertainties as to ultimate exposure  and therefore  reserve estimates are subject to variability 
the company s insurance subsidiaries are subject to complex government regulations 
the company s title insurance businesses are subject to extensive regulation by state insurance authorities in each state in which they operate 
these regulations are primarily intended for the protection of policyholders 
the nature and extent of these regulations typically involve  among other matters  licensing and renewal requirements and trade and marketing practices 
these regulations may restrict the company s ability to implement rate increases or other actions that it may want to take to enhance its operating results or have a negative impact on its ability to generate revenue and earnings 
insurance regulations limit the ability of the company s insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to it 
the company is an insurance holding company and has no substantial operations of its own 
the company s ability to pay dividends and meet its obligations is dependent among other things on the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends or repay funds to it 
the company s insurance subsidiaries are subject to insurance and other regulations that limit the amount of dividends  loans or advances to it based on the amount of adjusted unassigned surplus and net income and require these subsidiaries to maintain minimum amounts of capital  surplus and reserves 
in general  dividends in excess of prescribed limits are deemed extraordinary and require prior insurance regulatory approval 
these dividend restrictions could limit the company s ability to pay dividends to its stockholders or grow its business 
as of december   approximately  of the consolidated stockholders equity represented net assets of the company s subsidiaries that cannot be transferred in the form of dividends  loans or advances to the parent company under statutory regulations without prior insurance department approval 
for further discussion of the regulation of dividend payments and other transactions between affiliates  see liquidity and capital resources under management s discussion and analysis in item of this report 
the company s non insurance subsidiaries are also subject to state and federal regulations 
some of the company s other businesses operate within state and federal guidelines 
any changes in the applicable regulatory environment or changes in existing regulations could restrict its existing or future operations 
revenues from the company s exchange services segment are closely related to the level of real estate transactions  the tax rate on capital gains and other changes in the internal revenue code 
the company s revenues in future periods will continue to be subject to these and other factors which are beyond its control 
in february  the irs proposed new regulations which  if adopted  may negatively affect the ability of qualified intermediaries to retain interest earned on exchange funds they are holding 
if passed as proposed  these regulations would materially adversely impact the exchange services segment and the company s net income  since a significant portion of the exchange segment s revenues are based on retaining a portion of the interest income earned on deposits held by the company 
in addition  the investment management and trust services division is regulated by the north carolina commissioner of banks 
the performance of the company s investments depends on conditions that are outside its control 
a majority of the company s investments consist of fixed maturity securities 
changes in interest rates may have an adverse impact on the market value of the company s investment portfolio and its return on invested cash and could reduce the value of its investment portfolio and adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition 
a smaller percentage of total investments are in equities 
a change in general economic conditions  the stock market  or other external factors could adversely affect the value of these investments and  in turn  the company s results and financial condition 
the company may encounter difficulties managing growth or rapid technology changes  which could adversely affect its results 
the company has historically achieved revenue growth in part through a combination of developing related new products or services and increasing its market share for existing products 
a portion of the company s growth may be in services or geographic areas with which management is less familiar than with its core business and geographic areas 
the expansion of the company s business  particularly in new services or geographic areas  or significant changes in technology may subject it to associated risks  such as the diversion of management s attention  lack of substantial experience in operating such businesses and a change in competitive position resulting from rapid technology changes 
competition in the company s business affects its revenues 
the title insurance industry is highly competitive 
key factors that affect competition in the title insurance business are price  expertise  timeliness and quality of service and the financial strength and size of the insurer 
title companies compete for premiums by choosing various distribution channels which may include company owned operations and issuing agency relationships with attorneys  lenders  realtors  builders and other settlement service providers 
title insurance underwriters compete for agents on the basis of service and commission levels 
some title insurers currently have greater financial resources  larger distribution networks and more extensive computerized databases of property records and related information than the company 
the number and size of competing companies varies in the different geographic areas in which we operate 
competition among the major providers of title insurance  new entrants to the industry or the introduction and acceptance of new alternatives to traditional title products by the marketplace could adversely affect the company s operations and financial condition 
the company s success relies on its ability to attract and retain key personnel and agents 
competition for skilled and experienced personnel and agents in the company s industry is high 
the company may have difficulty hiring the necessary marketing and management personnel to support any future growth 
the loss of any key employee or the failure of any key employee to perform in their current position could prevent the company from realizing future growth 
also  the company cannot provide assurance that it will succeed in attracting or retaining new agents 
its results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if it is unsuccessful in attracting and retaining agents 
the company may experience significant claims relating to its title insurance operations which would adversely affect its results 
a significant component of the company s revenue arises from issuing title insurance policies which typically provides coverage for the real property mortgage lender and the buyer of the property 
the company also may be subject to a legal claim arising from the handling of escrow transactions 
the occurrence of a significant title or escrow claim in any given period could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations during that period 
a downgrade or a potential downgrade in one of the company s financial strength ratings could result in a loss of business 
the competitive positions of insurance companies  in general  have come to depend increasingly on independent ratings of their financial strength and claims paying ability 
a significant downgrade in the ratings of either of the company s policy issuing subsidiaries could negatively impact its ability to compete for new business and retain existing business and lead to a decrease in the company s stock price  the loss of certain licenses itic and ne itic need to operate as title insurance companies in various states and adversely affect results of operations 
regulatory and legal actions may result in financial losses and or harm to the company s reputation 
the title insurance industry has recently been  and continues to be  under regulatory scrutiny in a number of states with respect to pricing practices  and possible real estate settlement procedures act respa violations and unlawful rebating practices 
the regulatory investigations have resulted in settlements and fines for other underwriters and could lead to industry wide reductions in premium rates and escrow fees  the inability to get rate increases when necessary  as well as changes that could adversely affect the company s ability to compete for or retain business or raise the costs of additional regulatory compliance 
the department of housing and urban development hud is responsible for enforcing respa 
while timing and content are uncertain  hud continues to indicate that it would like to revise respa regulations which would result in changes to the existing industry regulatory framework that could have a material impact on the company s marketing and operations 
the company may experience losses resulting from regulatory noncompliance  fraud  defalcation or misconduct 
fraud  defalcation  regulatory noncompliance and other misconduct by the company s agents  approved attorneys and employees are risks inherent in the company s business 
agents or approved attorneys typically handle large sums of money in trust pursuant to the closing of real estate transactions and a misappropriation of funds by any of these parties could result in title claims 
the company relies upon north carolina for about of its title insurance premiums 
north carolina is the largest source of revenue for the title insurance segment and  in  north carolina based premiums accounted for approximately of premiums earned by the company 
a decrease in north carolina business would negatively impact financial operations 
key accounting and information systems are concentrated in a few locations 
the company s home office  accounting and technology operations are concentrated in north carolina 
these critical business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters  fire  power shortages and other events beyond the company s control 
a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of the company s critical business operations or systems could severely affect its ability to conduct normal business operations and  as a result  there could be a material and adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
provisions of the company s shareholder rights plan may make a takeover of our company difficult 
the company has a shareholders rights plan which could discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control  including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to the company s shareholders for their common shares 
item b

in november  the company purchased approximately  square feet of additional office space in chapel hill  north carolina that was previously leased for itec  itac  itic s commercial services division and itic s settlement services division 
item legal proceedings the company and its subsidiaries are involved in various legal proceedings that are incidental to their business 
in the company s opinion  based on the present status of these proceedings  any potential liability of the company or its subsidiaries with respect to these legal proceedings will not  in the aggregate  be material to the company s consolidated financial condition or results of operations
