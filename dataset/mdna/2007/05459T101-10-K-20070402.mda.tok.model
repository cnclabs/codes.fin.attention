we undertake no obligation to update these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect actual outcomes 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview we design  develop  market and manufacture fixed wireless voice and broadband data products for the worldwide telecommunications market 
our product portfolio includes fixed wireless desktop phones  public call office pco phones  voice data terminals  broadband modems  and g gateway devices for access to voice calling and high speed data services 
our products have similar functionality to phones and modems that use the traditional landline telecommunications network  however  they are wireless desktop devices and can be substituted for wired phones and modems 
all products that we have sold prior to the second quarter of were based on cdma g code division multiple access technology developed by qualcomm incorporated 
we started development of new products based on gsm global system for mobile communications and gprs general packet radio service technologies in and started shipments of these products in the second quarter of in addition to the introduction of gsm and gprs based products  in we increased our focus on the development of data products  including broadband modems and g gateway devices  which represent an increasing percentage of our overall revenues we currently sell our products to telecommunications operators in developing countries where large segments of the population do not have telephone service 
to date our largest markets have been in asia and south america  with our largest customers located in india and venezuela 
we ended the year with a total of customers in countries 
history we were founded in july in late we began performing original design manufacturing and product engineering and development for major international telecommunications companies 
in december  we acquired entatel  ltd  a south korean company  in order to meet the engineering requirements of these projects  and changed its name to axesstel r d center co  ltd 
this name was later changed to axesstel korea inc and continues as our operating research and development subsidiary located in korea 
our primary business in was focused on contract research and development and we engaged in only limited manufacturing and product sales on behalf of third parties 
in late and early  we believed that changing market factors would result in increasing demand for fixed wireless phones 
in response  we refocused our business to concentrate exclusively on developing  manufacturing and selling our own branded and co branded fixed wireless products 

table of contents in the first quarter of  we commenced large scale product manufacturing with our taiwan based manufacturing partner  wistron neweb corporation  or wnc 
in the third quarter of  wnc transitioned our production lines from taiwan to mainland china to take advantage of lower production costs and better access to the china supply chain 
wnc presently has three high speed production lines dedicated to high volume production  and the ability to add additional lines to match future capacity needs 
we continue to work with wnc in sourcing components for our products in an effort to reduce costs  ensure the quality of the components we purchase and mitigate against the risk that components are not available at the time we need the components to fulfill our customer orders 
we believe wnc provides flexibility and scalability to our manufacturing operations 
recent developments we believe that was a year of stabilization for axesstel 
during the year  we focused on four key operating objectives broadening our addressable market  strengthening our management team  improving financial performance  and enhancing our product line 
first  we expanded our geographical reach and addressable market 
during the year  we increased our presence in latin america and asia  developing new customer relationships in venezuela  india  indonesia  vietnam  and the philippines 
in  the majority of our sales were in asia  and predominantly india 
in  the majority of our sales have come from latin america 
we now have customers in countries 
however the markets in which we operate continually change 
in india  we localized final assembly with our manufacturing partner and we continue to provide our fixed wireless phones with bsnl 
we are looking at similar strategic  customized solutions with the other two carriers in india and elsewhere 
the latin american landscape is also changing 
in  we had a breakthrough year in venezuela capturing five times the phone orders over the prior year 
however  new leadership is taking over control at cantv in venezuela  resulting in short term uncertainty  as we move through this transitional phase 
despite our efforts and successes in increasing our addressable market we believe that in the intermediate term individual quarter results will be significantly impacted by our success or failure in securing large orders from a relatively small number of customers 
second  we made significant management changes at axesstel 
in may  marv tseu joined the company as our chief executive officer 
in october  we hired stephen sek as our chief technology officer to focus on developing a product roadmap of next generation data products 
also in october  we hired murray kawchuk to head up our sales efforts on a global level 
third  we stabilized revenues and delivered more consistent operating results 
while we finished with modest revenue gains over  we worked very hard in the second half of to diversify our product portfolio and customer base with the goal of achieving more consistent operating results 
after a slow start to the year  we achieved revenues of more than million and modest profitability in both the third and fourth quarters 
we have been focused on making prudent decisions with our spending and are continuing to make changes that are designed to improve the business for better financial performance 
in the second quarter  we closed and subsequently sold our korean manufacturing facility to reduce fixed operating expenses 
throughout the year  we localized our business and got closer to the customer in terms of sales and the supply chain 
also during the year  we localized our sales force and implemented a strategic sales program to benefit both axesstel and our customers 

table of contents fourth  we ended with a more diverse product portfolio  which is intended to appeal to a greater addressable market 
we created customized products to serve the needs of our unique customers 
on the telephone side we announced an expanded portfolio of gsm fixed wireless phones 
a new next generation of cdma fixed wireless desktop phones offering stylized industrial design 
we also bolstered our product line to include more modem products  which helped to increase our margins as well as diversify our revenue mix 
in  sales of modem products increased as a percentage of our revenues and helped us improve gross margins overall  bringing us to percent for the year 
during the year we introduced a wireless g gateway offering consumer and business users wi fi access to broadband data from any room in the home or office 
a sleek new portable ev do rev a usb modems for home and travel use providing consumers and mobile professionals with fixed wireless and mobile access to email  the internet and multimedia streaming at speeds up to mbps 
following the year end we announced our new usb modem and gateway for hsupa and edge networks 
entering  we believe this will be a year of transition 
we believe there is a continued opportunity for both our phone and modem product lines in all the territories we serve and have now expanded our sales force to reach out to new regions beyond those that we have traditionally served 
we are looking to continue to focus on customer and product diversification to mitigate revenue volatility 
our management team is positioned to develop new products with expanded applications and is implementing a strategy to sell to a broad list of new potential customers 
our localized sales force plan is progressing well  our new european sales presence is already producing results in eastern europe 
we will continue to migrate from phone to modem products as we are seeing greater opportunities in modems 
as such  we plan to invest in research and development with the intent of developing next generation data products  specifically a family of hsupa gateway and modem products to both improve profit margins and expand our addressable market 
we expect to have more data products to offer to our current customers  and we are planning to use our technology for new applications appealing to a new customer set 
we believe there are potential new applications for our wireless modem technology  and we are evaluating opportunities to expand our products to address enterprise business needs 
we anticipate such initiatives could increase margins 
it is our goal for to deliver consistent and improving results 
overall  we expect revenues to be approximately million with gross margins in the upper teens 
with respect to operating expenses  we intend to invest in growth and increase research and development and expenses associated with our sales activity 
although we realize profitability is highly dependent on product and customer mix and anticipate we may not be profitable every quarter  we are committed to achieving profitability for the year 
revenues our product portfolio consists of fixed wireless products in five categories desktop phones  pco phones  voice data terminals  broadband modems  and g gateway devices 
we have shipped the desktop phones and the pco phones since  voice data terminals and modems since  and gateway devices since we expect fixed wireless phones will continue to represent a major portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
however  we believe that an increasing portion of our anticipated growth will come from sales of our next generation data products  such as our fixed wireless broadband modem and g gateway devices  into developing and industrialized countries as demand grows for broadband data services 
in  we started development of new products based on gsm global system for mobile communications and gprs general packet radio service technologies and started shipments of these products in the second quarter of 
table of contents we sell our products to telecommunications service providers on a fixed price per unit basis 
our customers in turn resell our products to end users as part of the end users service activation 
for the year ended december   approximately of our revenues were derived from three customers  whose orders represented  and of revenues  respectively 
all of our sales are based on purchase orders or other short term arrangements 
we negotiate the pricing of our products based on the quantity and the length of the time for which deliveries are to be made 
for orders involving a significant number of units  or which involve deliveries over a long period of time  we typically receive rolling forecasts or a predetermined quantity for a fixed period of time from our customers  which in turn allows us to forecast internal volume and component requirements for manufacturing 
in order to minimize our collection risks  we attempt to sell to our international customers under guaranteed letters of credit or open terms secured by credit insurance 
at times  we extend credit based on evaluation of the customer s financial condition 
to date  substantially all of our product sales have been to customers outside of the united states 
in order to minimize foreign exchange risk  we have made all sales to date in us dollars 
we supply our principal manufacturer wnc with rolling forecasts 
in addition  we receive forecasts from our customers  and in turn  place orders with wnc for near term production 
based upon our purchase orders and forecasts  wnc procures components in amounts intended to meet the near term demand 
following receipt of our orders  wnc generally manufactures our products and delivers the finished goods to the customer s freight forwarder in china  transferring title at that point 
we generally recognize revenue upon the transfer of title to the freight forwarder 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold consists of direct materials  manufacturing expense  freight expense  warranty expense  and royalty fees 
we believe our ability to increase sales and achieve profitability will depend on our ability to reduce cost of goods sold 
we continue our cost reduction efforts through the following initiatives increasing our purchasing power through increased volume  ordering standardized parts used across our product lines  looking for additional manufacturing partners in regions where labor costs are low  such as brazil  china and india  reengineering our products with new technologies and expertise to decrease the number of components  relying more on application and software development than hardware  and improving our manufacturing processes 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for engineering personnel  facility expenses  employee travel  fees for outside service providers  test fees and depreciation of developmental test equipment 
the majority of this activity is for software  mechanical and hardware product development 
we expense these costs as they are incurred 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive and operational management  finance  legal  sales and marketing  program management and administrative personnel 
other costs include facility expenses  employee travel  bank and financing fees  insurance  legal expense  commissions  accounting  professional service providers  board of director expense  stockholder relations  amortization of intangible assets  and depreciation expense of software and other fixed assets 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that 
table of contents affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
in consultation with our board of directors  we have identified the following accounting policies that we believe are key to an understanding of our financial statements 
these accounting policies require management s most difficult  subjective judgments 
revenue recognition and warranty reserve revenues from product sales are recognized when the risks of ownership and title pass to the customer as specified in the respective sales agreements and other revenue recognition criterion as prescribed by staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
generally  the risks of ownership and title pass when product is received by the customer s freight forwarder 
if and when products are returned  we normally exchange them or provide credits to the customer 
the returned products in turn are shipped back to the third party manufacturer and we are issued a credit or exchange from the manufacturer 
at december   we recorded a sales return allowance of approximately  no additional significant returns are anticipated 
on certain contracts  we provide warranty replacement units ranging from percent of total units shipped 
the cost related to the warranty replacement unit is included in the cost of goods sold and recorded when revenue is recognized 
on other contracts  we do not provide warranty replacement units 
in these cases  we provide third party service centers to the customer for any warranty performance 
costs for these service centers are recorded to cost of goods sold 
during the year ended december   warranty costs amounted to approximately  and  as of december   we established a warranty reserve of  to cover additional service costs over the life of the warranty 
all products are tested by quality inspection prior to shipment and we have historically experienced a minimum level of defective units 
management believes that no additional warranty reserve is needed as of december   other than as discussed above 
accounts receivable allowance collections from product sales for foreign customers are often received via letter of credit arrangements or secured by credit insurance  subject to a deductible 
as such  collections on trade accounts receivable for foreign customers are reasonably assured 
at times  we extend credit based on evaluation of the customer s financial condition 
significant management judgment is required to determine the allowance for doubtful accounts 
based on our risk assessment of our receivables at december   we determined that no allowance for doubtful accounts was necessary 
capitalized software costs software development costs for products sold  which consist primarily of firmware embedded in our products  incurred after technological feasibility is established are capitalized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
amortization of these costs begins when the products are ready for sale 
sfas no 
and other authoritative literature  interpretations and industry practices prescribe that technological feasibility is reached when both the software and other components of the product s research and development activities are completed 
we begin capitalizing software development costs upon attainment of both requirements 
our engineering processes demonstrate that the research and development activities of our products are completed simultaneously with the commencement of the manufacturing process 
as such  we expense all research and development activities performed up to the commencement of the manufacturing process 

table of contents valuation of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill at least annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment and the carrying value of the asset cannot be recovered from projected undiscounted cash flows  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
our intangible assets consist mainly of our license from qualcomm incorporated  which we amortize over a five to ten year life 
deferred tax assets we periodically and at least annually evaluate the realizability of the net deferred tax assets  taking into consideration prior earnings history  actual revenue and operations  projected operating results and the reversal of temporary differences 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r revised  share based payment  sfas r which establishes standards for the accounting of transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  primarily focusing on accounting for transactions where an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments  including stock options  based on the grant date fair value of the award and to recognize it as compensation expense over the period the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  usually the vesting period 
sfas r supersedes our previous accounting under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  for periods beginning january  in march  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab relating to sfas r 
we have applied the provisions of sab in our adoption of sfas r 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the application of the accounting standard as of january  our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  reflect the impact of sfas r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas r  except for disclosures for comparative purposes 
sfas r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statements of operations 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for stock based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb as allowed under statement of financial accounting standards 
table of contents no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
under the intrinsic value method  no stock based compensation expense had been recognized in our consolidated statements of operations  as all options granted under those plans are intended to have an exercise price equal to or greater than the market value of the underlying common stock at the date of grant 
annual results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the consolidated statements of operations data and the percentages of total revenues thereto 
year ended december  in thousands revenues cost of goods sold gross margin operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative litigation settlement impairment of assets total operating expenses operating loss other income expense  net loss before income taxes income tax provision benefit net loss comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  general we established record revenues of million in based on strong revenue growth in the second half of the year 
we entered with a declining revenue base due to reduced phone sales in our asia market that originated in the second half of this decline continued in the first quarter of  as revenues decreased to million 
starting in the second quarter of  revenues rebounded due to improved customer and product diversification 
we established record revenues in latin america and from our data products  and recorded revenues of million  million  and million in the second  third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
the increased revenues from our data products has led to record product gross margins of percent in the third quarter of  percent in the fourth quarter and percent overall for the revenue growth in the second half of combined with the data product mix additionally led to profitability in the second half of we believe demand for our products is increasing as evidenced by our increased revenue in the second half of in  we expect revenues to increase from million in to approximately million  a percent projected growth rate 
our objective is to expand our customer base to reach new customers and new regions 
we anticipate that most of our sales will be to foreign customers or for products to be used in foreign countries 
as we grow  we expect to become less dependent on a limited concentration of customers 
factors that may cause our results of operations to fluctuate include those discussed in the risk factors section of this report 

table of contents revenues for the year ended december   revenues were million compared to million for the year ended december   representing a increase

revenues increased substantially during for broadband modem products and our objective is to expand our product portfolio for broadband modem products in  as well as to expand our customer base to reach new customers and new regions 
we continue to expect that most of our sales will be to foreign customers or for products to be used in foreign countries 
as we grow  we expect to become less dependent on a limited concentration of customers 
cost of goods sold for the year ended december   cost of goods sold was million compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of 
the decrease reflects the product mix shift from modem revenue content in to modem revenue content in  as we typically experience higher average selling prices on our data product line 
our cost of materials declined on a per unit basis in as we were able to re engineer our products to take advantage of cost efficient alternate parts  and reduce prices with our suppliers 
in and continuing into  most of our products were manufactured by one vendor wnc 
we continue to work toward reduced manufacturing costs on a unit basis 
we anticipate that our vendor will be able to further decrease its costs to us due to its transition from taiwan to china  and as our purchase volume increases 
we are also evaluating additional manufacturing vendors and other vendors to produce specific hardware and other components used in the manufacturing process in an effort to further reduce cost of goods sold 
gross margin for the year ended december   gross margin as a percentage of revenues was compared to for the year ended december  the gross margin percentages increase was mainly the result of favorable product mix from our data products during the comparative periods  as we typically experience higher margins from our data products than from our phone products 
we expect demand for our data product to remain strong in  and expect the gross margin percentage to remain at the levels 
however  margins may fluctuate due to customer and product mix  manufacturing and supply chain management  as well as other factors 
research and development for the year ended december   research and development expenses were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of 
as a percentage of revenue  research and development for and were 
we are presently spending much of our research and development funds on our next generation phones  and a new line of data and gsm products 
in addition  significant modifications to current products are required for each customer and each geographical location where the end user is located 
we expect research and development expenditures to increase in absolute terms but decrease as a percent of revenues in selling  general and administrative for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of 
this increase was primarily due to external sales commissions of million in compared to external sales commissions of approximately  in the majority of these commissions were in connection with revenues from 
table of contents latin america 
other increases were primarily attributed to increases in wages and benefits of approximately  as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administration expenses for were compared to in as our revenues increase  we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to grow and build our infrastructure  but decrease as a percentage of revenues 
impairment of assets for the year ended december   an impairment charge of million was charged to operating expenses related to production equipment from our closed down manufacturing operations in korea 
other income expense for the year ended december   other income expense was a net benefit of approximately  this amount included interest and other income of million  offset by approximately  of expense associated from debt and financing activities 
the majority of the million other income benefit was derived from the sale of  shares of ubistar common stock  formerly known as axess telecom  an unrelated third party 
the  shares of ubistar common stock were acquired as part of a litigation settlement in for the year ended december   other income expense was a net expense of approximately  this amount included interest and other income of approximately  offset by approximately  of expense associated from debt and financing activities 
this expense included prepayment penalties of approximately  and the expensing of approximately  for finder fees  note payable discounts  and interest 
in an increasing portion of our sales were made on credit terms 
we established a working capital facility of up to million with silicon valley bank 
we expect interest expenses to increase in based on our current debt levels 
provision for income taxes for the year ended december   an income tax provision of zero was recorded compared to an income tax provision of million for the year ended december  the income tax provision in reflected a write off of a previously established tax asset 
we no longer record tax benefits against net losses and have established a full reserve against all deferred tax assets 
in addition  according to internal revenue code regulations  we were deemed in october and march to have experienced two changes in ownership during the past three years 
these changes in ownership limit the use of our net operating loss carry forward to a specific amount each year 
we may in the future experience further ownership change events  which would similarly limit use of any net operating loss carry forwards that might otherwise be available subsequent to the date of the most recent ownership changes 
net loss for the year ended december   net loss was million compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenues for the year ended december   revenues were million compared to million for the year ended december   representing a increase

for the year ended december   all revenues were derived from our phone products 
revenues increased substantially during  however we did experience declines in the second half of the year 
the decline in resulted from a few issues that caused a slowdown in orders 
first  homologation and testing by our largest customer of two newly introduced products were delayed in part due to the devastating weather conditions that affected india in early august  second  a customer in pakistan renegotiated its payment terms for its new nationwide license and slowed orders during that process  and third  a latin american carrier has delayed orders in anticipation of our new gsm product launch 
cost of goods sold for the year ended december   cost of goods sold was million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of 
the increase tracked similar to the associated increase in revenues 
we are looking to reduce manufacturing costs on a unit basis 
our cost of goods sold declined on a per unit basis in  as we were able to re engineer some of the components within our products to take advantage of cost efficient alternate parts  and reduce prices with our suppliers based on increasing purchasing power 
gross margin for the years ended december  and  gross margin as a percentage of revenues was 
we had previously expected gross margins to increase from in to in as we introduced higher margin data products 
however  margins were affected in the second half of by the m expense recorded for start up costs and unabsorbed overhead associated with our korean manufacturing facility 
research and development for the year ended december   research and development expenses were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of 
as a percentage of revenue  research and development for decreased to from in two new product lines were released during and are currently available for sale

selling  general and administrative for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of percent 
this increase is primarily attributed to an increase in wages and benefits of million including severance pay of  depreciation and amortization of approximately  allowance for doubtful accounts of  and other operating expenses of approximately  our selling  general and administrative expenses increased substantially during the year as we continued to grow and build our infrastructure 
however  as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses in remained at as compared to litigation settlement in october  we entered into a settlement agreement with axess telecom co  ltd 
pursuant to the agreement  we paid axess telecom  of which approximately  related to the settlement agreement and approximately  relates to the currency exchange rates in december under the 
table of contents settlement agreement  axess telecom agreed to dismiss its lawsuit against the company s wholly owned subsidiary  axesstel california 
we in turn agreed on behalf of our subsidiary  axesstel r d center co  ltd  not to enforce a court order prohibiting axess telecom from using certain trade names related to a trademark owned by axesstel r d center  provided axess telecom stops all use within six months from the date of the settlement agreement 
the parties agreed that the former agreements to which axess telecom and axesstel california were parties are terminated  that neither party s current or prior products infringe on the other party s intellectual property rights  and that the parties are free to compete with each other 
we also entered into a memorandum of understanding with axess telecom pursuant to which we agreed to purchase krw billion approximately  based on currency exchange rates at the time of settlement convertible bonds of axess telecom by january  due to the requirements to make this purchase and uncertainty as to the recoupment of our investment in axess telecom  if any  we charged the additional  as litigation settlement during the quarter ended september  furthermore  we have recorded charges of approximately  in the fourth quarter of and approximately  in the first quarter of to reflect the payment at the current currency exchange rate 
the purchase of the convertible bonds was since completed in the first quarter of other income expense for the year ended december   other income expense was a net expense of  this amount included interest and other income of approximately  offset by approximately  of expense associated from debt and financing activities

provision benefit for income taxes for the year ended december   an income tax provision of million was recorded compared to an income tax benefit of approximately  for the year ended december  the million provision was recorded in q to increase the income tax valuation reserve against our previously recorded deferred tax asset 
this asset was established in in recognition of an anticipated tax benefit associated with our net operating losses 
we expected to benefit from this asset in the current year  however  due to the current operating results from the third quarter of  we cannot determine if it is probable that we will be able to utilize the tax benefit 
accordingly  we have established a full reserve against the asset 
in addition  according to internal revenue code regulations  we were deemed in october and march to have experienced two changes in ownership during the past three years 
these changes in ownership limit the use of our net operating loss carry forward to a specific amount each year 
we may in the future experience further ownership change events  which would similarly limit use of any net operating loss carry forwards that might otherwise be available subsequent to the date of the most recent ownership changes 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at december  in addition  at december   accounts receivable were million  compared to million at december  at december   approximately of our accounts receivable are covered by letters of credit or are insured  and we have subsequently collected million of those receivables as of march  at december   we had working capital of approximately million compared to working capital of million at december  for the year ended december   we used million of cash in operations versus million of cash in operations for the year ended december  the million cash used in operations in included the cash net loss of million

investment activities used million of cash during the year ended december   primarily for the acquisition of software and equipment 
during the year ended december   we had cash provided by financing activities of million  as we repaid million of bank financing from december   received new bank financing of million  and received cash proceeds from the issuance of common stock of approximately  in august  we entered into a two year  million  receivable based credit facility with silicon valley bank svb  and later increased this facility to million 
the outstanding principal balance of the loans bore interest ranging from the libor rate plus to svb s prime rate plus depending on the receivable financed 
payments of principal were immediately due and payable to svb in the amount of each payment that we received under the pledged receivables 
as of december   we do not have any significant commitments for capital expenditures 
however  the increase in revenues during the third and fourth quarters  as well as the transition from largely letter of credit based sales in asia to open account terms in latin america have increased our working capital requirements 
to the extent that our sales continue to increase  or we are compelled to provide more credit terms to a greater percentage of our customers  our working capital needs will continue to increase 
we are presently reviewing other options besides debt financing to supplement our liquidity including the issuance of equity securities 
changes in our operating plans  lower than anticipated revenues  increased expenses or other events  including those described in risk factors  may cause us to seek additional debt or equity financing in the future 
future financing may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all  and our failure to raise capital when needed could negatively impact our growth plans and our financial condition and results of operations 
contractual obligations and commitments as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements
