the company faces the risk that its furnishings could be provided by companies with cheaper labor sources  such as from asian sources 
however  the lack of sufficient lead times from its customers  as well as the customized nature of many of the company s products  presents a substantial barrier to entry for overseas firms

critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments the company uses in applying its accounting policies have a significant impact on the results it reports in the financial statements 
some of the accounting policies require it to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the most critical accounting estimates include the valuation of accounts receivable and inventory 
the company reviews its accounts receivable portfolio frequently  assessing any past due accounts for collectability 
physical inventories are conducted at each of the company s manufacturing facilities at least quarterly  and inventories are assessed for any slow moving or obsolete items  which constitutes the main judgment necessary in valuing the inventory 
reserves for both receivables and inventory are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as required 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued other assumptions the company faces are the assessment of goodwill  intangible asset  and long lived assets for impairment  the calculation of the provision for income taxes and valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the company believes that its assumptions in relation to its critical accounting policies have been reasonably accurate  and does not foresee any future material changes in its estimates or assumptions

net accounts receivable decreased  at december   when compared to december  accounts receivable decreased due to a lower days sales outstanding and a reduction of sales volume in the fourth quarter of when compared to the fourth quarter of days sales outstanding dso decreased from days at the end of fiscal to days at the end of fiscal in january  the company began assigning certain account receivables under a receivables servicing and credit approved receivables purchasing agreement with cit group commercial services inc only receivables from sales to the hospitality industry may be assigned to cit 
under the agreement cit provides credit checking  credit approval  and collection responsibilities for the assigned receivables 
if cit approves an order from a hospitality customer and the resulting receivables are not paid or disputed by the customer within ninety days of sale  cit will pay the receivable to the company and assume ownership of the receivable 
cit begins collection efforts for the assigned receivables both approved and not approved when they are due hospitality sales are made on net terms 
approved receivables were approximately  at december  hospitality customers are instructed to make payments directly to cit and cit then wires collected funds to the company 
the company pays cit six tenths of a percent of all assigned receivables 
management believes this cost will be mostly offset by reductions in bad debt expense and collection costs 
the company entered into this arrangement to take advantage of cit s extensive credit checking and collection capabilities 
management believes this arrangement has improved liquidity 
net inventories decreased  at december   when compared to december  the decrease in net inventories was due to an increase in reserves for slow moving items 
gross inventories increased by  capital expenditures for were  compared to  in expenditures for included  to purchase and construct buildings for the company s hospitality operations in abbotsford  wisconsin and red bay  alabama

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued cost of products sold as a percentage of sales was in versus in the company experienced increases in its material costs in due to the impact of approximately  writedown of inventory 
a number of reasons contributed to this writedown  including the slowdown of travel trailer sales in the second half of the year  the increasing use of imported fabrics with longer lead times  customer bankruptcies  marketing decisions  and inventory management issues 
the company is addressing the cause of these unusually high write offs and expects to return to more normal costs going forward 
labor costs increased about of net sales  largely due to shorter lead times and smaller production lot sizes  conditions which may be expected to continue in the current market environment

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued selling and administrative expenses increased to  in from  in as a percentage of sales  selling and administrative expenses increased from to 
most of the increase is attributable to a decision to convert the company s erp system to a different software platform 
impairment of the old system resulted in a one time  pretax charge 
without this charge  selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales would have been 
increased commission expense due to increased hospitality industry sales was also another major reason for the increase 
interest  investment and other income remained flat at  in  while interest expense decreased  or 
the decrease in interest expense resulted primarily from the final payment of the fleetwood acquisition liability in january  partially offset by the effect of higher interest rates on the company s variable rate obligations 
net income was  in compared to  in net income as a percent of sales decreased to in compared to in the provision for income taxes  as a percentage of income before taxes  decreased from to 
this is due to disqualifying dispositions of employee stock options  for which the company received an income tax benefit  as well as the effects of the american jobs creation act  which provide tax benefits for companies that provide american manufacturing jobs 
without the previously mentioned charge for the company s software conversion  the company would have experienced an increase in net income for ebitda ebitda represents income before income taxes  interest expense  depreciation and amortization and is an approximation of cash flow from operations before tax 
the company uses ebitda as an internal measure of performance and believes it is a useful and commonly used measure of financial performance in addition to income before taxes and other profitability measures under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
ebitda is not a measure of performance under gaap 
ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to operating income and income before taxes as an indicator of the company s operations in accordance with gaap 
nor is ebitda an alternative to cash flow from operating activities in accordance with gaap 
the company s definition of ebitda can differ from that of other companies

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
the company faces minimum potential market risk in its long term debt 
the company had four separate long term debt agreements outstanding as of december  the company faces the risk that if market interest rates increase  the two interest rate obligations of the company with a variable interest rate would require higher payments of interest 
as of december   the bond secured by the company s goshen  indiana property of  had a variable interest rate of per annum 
each increase of could increase interest expense by approximately  in and lower amounts in successive years as principal is paid down  terminating in also  the  bond on the company s bloomsburg  pennsylvania property had a variable interest rate of at december  each increase of in market rates could cause an increase in interest expense of less than  in as principal is paid down  terminating in interest rates are exclusive of letter of credit fees paid to third parties to guarantee the payment of these obligations  which fees are or less  and are not subject to increase 
the company s revolving line of credit is also subject to a variable rate 
the amount outstanding on this line at december  was  with a variable interest rate of 
the company believes the risks associated with its fixed rate obligations are minimal  as the company believes the current rates approximate current market rates  and that the current market rates are unlikely to go significantly lower 
should market interest rates rise significantly  the company would benefit in that it would have locked in a lower fixed rate that will remain in effect for the life of the loan
