lee partners  lp and bain capital partners llc on november   we agreed to be acquired by a group of private equity funds sponsored by bain capital partners  llc and thomas h 
lee partners  lp the transaction is subject to shareholder approval  antitrust clearances  fcc approval and other customary closing conditions 
for a discussion of this transaction  see item above 
we plan to sell small market radio stations and all of our television stations on november  we announced plans to sell radio stations located outside the top us media markets and all of our television stations 
the sale of these assets is not contingent on the closing of the merger with the private equity funds sponsored by bain capital partners  llc and thomas h 
lee partners  lp definitive asset purchase agreements were signed for radio stations as of december  these stations  along with stations which were sold in the fourth quarter of  were classified as assets held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet and as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations 
through february   we had definitive asset purchase agreements for the sale of radio stations 
the closing of these radio station sales is subject to antitrust clearances  fcc approval and other customary closing conditions 
format of presentation management s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
our discussion is presented on both a consolidated and segment basis 
our reportable operating segments are radio broadcasting  which includes our national syndication business  americas outdoor advertising and international outdoor advertising 
included in the other segment are television broadcasting and our media representation business  katz media  as well as other general support services and initiatives 
we manage our operating segments primarily focusing on their operating income  while corporate expenses  merger expenses  gain on disposition of assets net  interest expense  gain loss on marketable securities  equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates  other income expense net  income tax benefit expense  minority interest net of tax  discontinued operations and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle are managed on a total company basis and are  therefore  included only in our discussion of consolidated results 
radio broadcasting our local radio markets are run predominantly by local management teams who control the formats selected for their programming 
the formats are designed to reach audiences with targeted demographic characteristics that appeal to our advertisers 
our advertising rates are principally based on how many people in a targeted audience listen to our stations  as measured by an independent ratings service 
the size of the market influences rates as well  with larger markets typically receiving higher rates than smaller markets 
also  our advertising rates are influenced by the time of day the advertisement airs  with morning and evening drive time hours typically the highest 
radio advertising contracts are typically less than one year 
management monitors macro level indicators to assess our radio operations performance 
due to the geographic diversity and autonomy of our markets  we have a multitude of market specific advertising rates and audience demographics 
therefore  our discussion of the results of operations of our radio broadcasting segment focuses on the macro level indicators that management monitors to assess our radio segment s financial condition and results of operations 
management looks at our radio operations overall revenues as well as local advertising  which is sold predominately in a station s local market  and national advertising  which is sold across multiple markets 
local advertising is sold by our local radio stations sales staffs while national advertising is sold  for the most part  through our national representation firm 
local advertising  which is our largest source of advertising revenue  and national advertising revenues are tracked separately  because these revenue streams have different sales forces and respond differently to changes in the economic environment 
management also looks at radio revenue by market size  as defined by arbitron 
typically  larger markets can reach larger audiences with wider demographics than smaller markets 
over half of our radio revenue and divisional operating expenses comes from our largest markets 
additionally  management reviews our share of target demographics listening to the radio in an average quarter hour 
this metric gauges how well our formats are attracting and keeping listeners 

table of contents a significant portion of our radio segment s expenses vary in connection with changes in revenue 
these variable expenses primarily relate to costs in our sales department  such as salaries  commissions and bad debt 
our programming and general and administrative departments incur most of our fixed costs  such as talent costs  rights fees  utilities and office salaries 
lastly  our highly discretionary costs are in our marketing and promotions department  which we primarily incur to maintain and or increase our audience share 
outdoor advertising our revenues are derived from selling advertising space on the displays that we own or operate in key markets worldwide  consisting primarily of billboards  street furniture displays and transit displays 
we own the majority of our advertising displays  which typically are located on sites that we either lease or own or for which we have acquired permanent easements 
our advertising contracts with clients typically outline the number of displays reserved  the duration of the advertising campaign and the unit price per display 
our advertising rates are based on the gross rating points  or total number of impressions delivered  expressed as a percentage of a market population of a display or group of displays 
the number of impressions delivered by a display is measured by the number of people passing the site during a defined period of time and  in some international markets  is weighted to account for such factors as illumination  proximity to other displays and the speed and viewing angle of approaching traffic 
management typically monitors our business by reviewing the average rates  average revenues per display  occupancy  and inventory levels of each of our display types by market 
in addition  because a significant portion of our advertising operations are conducted in foreign markets  principally france and the united kingdom  management reviews the operating results from our foreign operations on a constant dollar basis 
a constant dollar basis allows for comparison of operations independent of foreign exchange movements 
because revenue sharing and minimum guaranteed payment arrangements are more prevalent in our international operations  the margins in our international operations typically are less than the margins in our americas operations 
also  the margins on our billboard contracts tend to be higher than for our other displays 
the significant expenses associated with our operations include i direct production  maintenance and installation expenses  ii site lease expenses for land under our displays and iii revenue sharing or minimum guaranteed amounts payable under our street furniture and transit display contracts 
our direct production  maintenance and installation expenses include costs for printing  transporting and changing the advertising copy on our displays  the related labor costs  the vinyl and paper costs and the costs for cleaning and maintaining our displays 
vinyl and paper costs vary according to the complexity of the advertising copy and the quantity of displays 
our site lease expenses include lease payments for use of the land under our displays  as well as any revenue sharing arrangements or minimum guaranteed amounts payable we may have with the landlords 
the terms of our americas site leases generally range from to years 
internationally  the terms of our site lease and revenue share minimum guarantee contracts generally range from to years  but may vary across our networks 
our street furniture and transit display contracts  the terms of which range from to years  generally require us to make upfront investments in property  plant and equipment 
these contracts may also include upfront lease payments and or minimum annual guaranteed lease payments 
we can give no assurance that our cash flows from operations over the terms of these contracts will exceed the upfront and minimum required payments 
fas r  share based payment we adopted fas r  share based payment  on january  under the modified prospective approach which requires us to recognize employee compensation cost related to our stock option grants in the same line items as cash compensation in the financial statements for all options granted after the date of adoption as well as for any options that were unvested at adoption 
under the modified prospective approach  no stock option expense attributable to these options is reflected in the financial statements for the amounts recorded as share based payments in the financial statements during relate to the expense associated with restricted stock awards 
as of december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share based compensation arrangements 
this cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately three years  unless the merger agreement is approved  then the expense becomes recognizable at the closing of the transaction 
the fair value of each option awarded is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
expected volatilities are based on implied volatilities from traded options on our stock  historical volatility on our stock  and other factors 
the expected life of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are 
table of contents expected to be outstanding 
management uses historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods equal to the expected life of the option

this shelf registration statement was automatically effective on august  for a period of three years 

table of contents debt covenants the significant covenants on our billion five year  multi currency revolving credit facility relate to leverage and interest coverage contained and defined in the credit agreement 
the leverage ratio covenant requires us to maintain a ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness to operating cash flow as defined by the credit agreement of less than x 
the interest coverage covenant requires us to maintain a minimum ratio of operating cash flow as defined by the credit agreement to interest expense of x 
in the event that we do not meet these covenants  we are considered to be in default on the credit facility at which time the credit facility may become immediately due 
at december   our leverage and interest coverage ratios were x and x  respectively 
this credit facility contains a cross default provision that would be triggered if we were to default on any other indebtedness greater than million 
our other indebtedness does not contain provisions that would make it a default if we were to default on our credit facility 
the fees we pay on our billion  five year multi currency revolving credit facility depend on our long term debt ratings 
based on our current ratings level of bbb baa  our fees on borrowings are a basis point spread to libor and are basis points on the total billion facility 
in the event our ratings improve  the fee on borrowings and facility fee decline gradually to basis points and basis points  respectively  at ratings of a a or better 
in the event that our ratings decline  the fee on borrowings and facility fee increase gradually to basis points and basis points  respectively  at ratings of bb ba or lower 
we believe there are no other agreements that contain provisions that trigger an event of default upon a change in long term debt ratings that would have a material impact to our financial statements 
additionally  our senior notes due  which were originally issued by amfm operating inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of clear channel  contain certain restrictive covenants that limit the ability of amfm operating inc to incur additional indebtedness  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  pay dividends  consolidate  or effect certain asset sales

acquisitions our subsidiary  clear channel outdoor holdings  inc  or cco  completed the acquisition of interspace on july   by issuing million shares of cco s class a common stock and approximately million in cash 
the acquisition was valued at approximately million based on cco s common shares issued at the closing price on the date of acquisition and the cash consideration paid 
the terms of the acquisition provide for additional consideration based on interspace s financial performance 
as a result  we have accrued million of additional purchase consideration as of december  we acquired radio stations for million and a music scheduling company for million in cash and million of deferred purchase consideration during the year ended december  we also acquired americas and international outdoor display faces and additional equity interests in international outdoor companies for million in cash  which includes cash paid for interspace

treasury stock transactions our board of directors approved two separate share repurchase programs during  each for billion 
on february   our board of directors approved a third billion share repurchase program

as of december   million shares had been repurchased for an aggregate purchase price of billion  including commissions and fees  under the share repurchase programs 
we did not repurchase any shares during the fourth quarter of no additional shares have been repurchased subsequent to december  as the share repurchase program has been suspended  but may be recommenced at any time without notice subject to the terms of the merger agreement 
commitments  contingencies and future obligations commitments and contingencies there are various lawsuits and claims pending against us 
we believe that any ultimate liability resulting from those actions or claims will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
although we have recorded accruals based on our current assumptions of the future liability for these lawsuits  it is possible that future results of operations could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 
see also item legal proceedings and note i commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item included elsewhere in this report 

table of contents certain agreements relating to acquisitions provide for purchase price adjustments and other future contingent payments based on the financial performance of the acquired companies generally over a one to five year period 
we will continue to accrue additional amounts related to such contingent payments if and when it is determinable that the applicable financial performance targets will be met 
the aggregate of these contingent payments  if performance targets are met  would not significantly impact our financial position or results of operations 
future obligations in addition to our scheduled maturities on our debt  we have future cash obligations under various types of contracts 
we lease office space  certain broadcast facilities  equipment and the majority of the land occupied by our outdoor advertising structures under long term operating leases 
some of our lease agreements contain renewal options and annual rental escalation clauses generally tied to the consumer price index  as well as provisions for our payment of utilities and maintenance 
we have minimum franchise payments associated with non cancelable contracts that enable us to display advertising on such media as buses  taxis  trains  bus shelters and terminals 
the majority of these contracts contain rent provisions that are calculated as the greater of a percentage of the relevant advertising revenue or a specified guaranteed minimum annual payment 
also  we have non cancelable contracts in our radio broadcasting operations related to program rights and music license fees 
in the normal course of business  our broadcasting operations have minimum future payments associated with employee and talent contracts 
these contracts typically contain cancellation provisions that allow us to cancel the contract with good cause 
the scheduled maturities of our credit facility  other long term debt outstanding  future minimum rental commitments under non cancelable lease agreements  minimum payments under other non cancelable contracts  payments under employment talent contracts  capital expenditure commitments  and other long term obligations as of december  are as follows payment due by period in thousands less than to more than contractual obligations total year years to years years long term debt credit facility other long term debt interest payments on long term debt non cancelable operating leases non cancelable contracts employment talent contracts capital expenditures other long term obligations total other long term obligations consist of million related to asset retirement obligations recorded pursuant to financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which assumes the underlying assets will be removed at some period over the next years 
also included is million related to the maturity value of loans secured by forward exchange contracts that we accrete to maturity using the effective interest method and can be settled in cash or the underlying shares 
these contracts had an accreted value of million and the underlying shares had a fair value of million recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at december  also included in the table is million related to deferred compensation and retirement plans 
excluded from the table is million related to the fair value of interest rate swap agreements  cross currency swap agreements  and secured forward exchange contracts 
also excluded is million related to various obligations with no specific contractual commitment or maturity 

table of contents market risk interest rate risk at december   approximately of our long term debt  including fixed rate debt on which we have entered into interest rate swap agreements  bears interest at variable rates 
accordingly  our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates 
assuming the current level of borrowings at variable rates and assuming a two percentage point change in the year s average interest rate under these borrowings  it is estimated that our interest expense would have changed by million and that our net income would have changed by million 
in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  management may take actions to further mitigate its exposure 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this interest rate analysis assumes no such actions 
further  the analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
at december   we had entered into interest rate swap agreements with a billion aggregate notional amount that effectively float interest at rates based upon libor 
these agreements expire from february to march the fair value of these agreements at december  was a liability of million 
on february   our senior notes and the related interest rate swap agreement matured 
equity price risk the carrying value of our available for sale and trading equity securities is affected by changes in their quoted market prices 
it is estimated that a change in the market prices of these securities would change their carrying value at december  by million and would change accumulated comprehensive income loss and net income by million and million  respectively 
at december   we also held million of investments that do not have a quoted market price  but are subject to fluctuations in their value 
we maintain derivative instruments on certain of our available for sale and trading equity securities to limit our exposure to and benefit from price fluctuations on those securities 
foreign currency we have operations in countries throughout the world 
foreign operations are measured in their local currencies except in hyper inflationary countries in which we operate 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations 
to mitigate a portion of the exposure of international currency fluctuations  we maintain a natural hedge through borrowings in currencies other than the us dollar 
in addition  we have us dollar euro cross currency swaps which are also designated as a hedge of our net investment in euro denominated assets 
these hedge positions are reviewed monthly 
our foreign operations reported net income of million for the year ended december  it is estimated that a change in the value of the us dollar to foreign currencies would change net income for the year ended december  by million 
our earnings are also affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies as a result of our investments in various countries  all of which are accounted for under the equity method 
it is estimated that the result of a fluctuation in the value of the dollar relative to these foreign currencies at december  would change our equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates by million and would change our net income for the same period by approximately million 
this analysis does not consider the implications that such fluctuations could have on the overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment in the us or the foreign countries or on the results of operations of these foreign entities

critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates that are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such difference could be material 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note a  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this annual report on form k 
management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and they require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our independent auditor and the audit committee of our board of directors 
the following narrative describes these critical accounting estimates  the judgments and assumptions and the effect if actual results differ from these assumptions 
stock based compensation prior to january   we accounted for our share based payments under the recognition and measurement provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations  as permitted by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation statement 
under that method  when options were granted with a strike price equal to or greater than market price on date of issuance  there is no impact on earnings either on the date of grant or thereafter  absent certain modifications to the options 
subsequent to january   we account for stock based compensation in accordance with fas r  share based payment 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the 
table of contents vesting period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires assumptions and judgments about expected volatility and forfeiture rates  among other factors 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  our results of operations could be materially impacted 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  we record a specific reserve to reduce the amounts recorded to what we believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debt based on historical experience of bad debts as a percent of revenues for each business unit  adjusted for relative improvements or deteriorations in the agings and changes in current economic conditions 
if our agings were to improve or deteriorate resulting in a change in our allowance  it is estimated that our bad debt expense would have changed by million and our net income would have changed by million 
long lived assets long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that depreciable and amortizable long lived assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets 
when specific assets are determined to be unrecoverable  the cost basis of the asset is reduced to reflect the current fair market value 
we use various assumptions in determining the current fair market value of these assets  including future expected cash flows and discount rates  as well as future salvage values 
our impairment loss calculations require management to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows  including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 
using the impairment review described  we found no impairment charge required for the year ended december  if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations 
we review goodwill for potential impairment annually using the income approach to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
the fair value of our reporting units is used to apply value to the net assets of each reporting unit 
to the extent that the carrying amount of net assets would exceed the fair value  an impairment charge may be required to be recorded 
the income approach we use for valuing goodwill involves estimating future cash flows expected to be generated from the related assets  discounted to their present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
terminal values were also estimated and discounted to their present value 
in accordance with statement  we performed our annual impairment tests as of october   and on goodwill 
no impairment charges resulted from these tests 
we may incur additional impairment charges in future periods under statement to the extent we do not achieve our expected cash flow growth rates  and to the extent that market values and long term interest rates in general decrease and increase  respectively 
indefinite lived assets indefinite lived assets are reviewed annually for possible impairment using the direct method as prescribed in sec staff announcement no 
d  use of the residual method to value acquired assets other than goodwill 
under the direct method  it is assumed that rather than acquiring indefinite lived intangible assets as a part of a going concern business  the buyer hypothetically obtains indefinite lived intangible assets and builds a new operation with similar attributes from scratch 
thus  the buyer incurs start up costs during the build up phase which are normally associated with going concern value 
initial capital costs are deducted from the discounted cash flows model which results in value that is directly attributable to the indefinite lived intangible assets 
our key assumptions using the direct method are market revenue growth rates  market share  profit margin  duration and profile of the build up period  estimated start up capital costs and losses incurred during the build up period  the risk adjusted discount rate and terminal values 
this data is populated using industry normalized information representing an average station within a market 

table of contents if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates  we may be exposed to impairment charges in the future 
our annual impairment test was performed as of october   which resulted in no impairment 
tax accruals the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities routinely examine our tax returns 
from time to time  the irs challenges certain of our tax positions 
we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and we would vigorously defend these positions if challenged 
the final disposition of any positions challenged by the irs could require us to make additional tax payments 
we believe that we have adequately accrued for any foreseeable payments resulting from tax examinations and consequently do not anticipate any material impact upon their ultimate resolution 
the estimate of our tax accruals contains uncertainty because management uses judgment to estimate the exposure associated with our various filing positions 
although management believes that our estimates and judgments are reasonable  actual results could differ  and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
to the extent there are changes in the expected outcome of tax examinations  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 
litigation accruals we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and  as required  have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
management s estimates used have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 
insurance accruals we are currently self insured beyond certain retention amounts for various insurance coverages  including general liability and property and casualty 
accruals are recorded based on estimates of actual claims filed  historical payouts  existing insurance coverage and projections of future development of costs related to existing claims 
our self insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management must make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of december  if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments  we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
a change in our self insurance liabilities at december   would have affected net earnings by approximately million for the year ended december  inflation inflation has affected our performance in terms of higher costs for wages  salaries and equipment 
although the exact impact of inflation is indeterminable  we believe we have offset these higher costs by increasing the effective advertising rates of most of our broadcasting stations and outdoor display faces 
ratio of earnings to fixed charges the ratio of earnings to fixed charges is as follows year ended december  the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a total enterprise basis 
earnings represent income from continuing operations before income taxes less equity in undistributed net income loss of unconsolidated affiliates plus fixed charges 
fixed charges represent interest  amortization of debt discount and expense  and the estimated interest portion of rental charges 
we had no preferred stock outstanding for any period presented
