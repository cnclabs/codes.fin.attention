item business overview we were established in to develop proprietary polymer materials and products based on these materials 
we are currently developing products for two primary markets bioscience and electro optics 
we design and synthesize polymer materials at the molecular level by using our expertise in nanotechnology  which is the development of products and production processes at a scale smaller than nanometers a nanometer is one billionth of a meter 
our goal is to optimize the electrical  optical and surface properties of these materials 
we use these materials to improve the design  performance and functionality of products for use in biochemical analysis and in optical communications networks and systems 
we believe we have developed a proprietary intellectual property position based on a combination of patents  licenses and trade secrets relating to the design and characterization of polymer materials  methods of polymer synthesis and production of polymers in commercial quantities  as well as device design  characterization  fabrication  testing and packaging technology 
from our inception through december   we were considered to be in the development stage concentrating primarily on the development of our technology and potential products 
products for wireless networking and biochip applications became available for customer evaluation in early  therefore  we were considered to have exited the development stage in to date  substantially all of our revenues have come from contracts to develop custom made electro optic materials and devices for government agencies 
as we transition to a product based company  we expect to record both revenue and expense from product sales  and to incur increased costs for sales and marketing and to increase general and administrative expense 
accordingly  the financial condition and results of operations reflected in our historical financial statements are not expected to be indicative of our future financial condition and results of operations 
in  we also began the development of our label free  high throughput detection system and related biochip products aimed primarily at the growing proteomics marketplace 
we also continued the development of our polymer modulators  and pending demand for higher bandwidth and speeds from optical communications equipment suppliers  we have been developing other applications for our modulators such as millimeter wave detection and communication systems 
we currently have products being evaluated by customers and potential customers in each of our product areas 
during march  we changed the organizational structure of our business to focus on our two primary markets  creating two distinct business segments bioscience and electro optics 
technology background nanotechnology polymer materials  engineering and process development polymers are large carbon based molecules that bond many small molecules together to form a long chain 
polymer materials can be engineered and optimized using nanotechnology to create a system in which unique electrical  chemical and electro optic characteristics can be controlled 
nanotechnology refers to the development of products and production processes at a scale smaller than nanometers a nanometer is one billionth of a meter 
materials based on polymers are used in a multitude of industrial and consumer products  from automotive parts to home appliances and furniture  as well as scientific and medical equipment 
we believe that polymer materials engineered at the molecular level can have a significant role in the future development of commercially relevant biotechnology and electro optic related products 
in addition  polymers  polymer based devices and the processes used to create them are often patentable  which can provide the developers of such technology with a significant competitive advantage 
markets and product opportunities bioscience segment the market lumera s bioscience business segment is focused on delivering tools and applications to the life science and pharmaceutical industry  specifically those concerned with discovering and characterizing proteins 
we are currently focused in two primary market segments antibodies and kinase inhibitors 
according to frost and sullivan  in  the pharmaceutical industry spent billion on instruments and consumables for compound screening 
we have estimated that therapeutic antibody characterization accounted for approximately million of that amount 
while we do not yet have precise data on the kinase inhibitor screening segment  we believe that it is similar in size to the therapeutic antibody segment 
according to frost and sullivan  nearly billion of the billion that is spent industry wide on pharmaceutical research and development is focused on kinase inhibitors 
lumera bioscience product opportunity we are developing a high throughput surface plasmon resonance spr biosensor designed to enable discovery and characterization of proteins 
in addition  the system is being designed to characterize possible drug candidates that target protein molecules and to facilitate biomarker discovery and protein pathway elucidation 
lumera s competitive advantage is expected to be the ability to provide researchers kinetic information about protein interactions in a label free and high throughput format 
our nanocapture arrays are a family of microarrays targeting specific applications 
our initial product is expected to be a nanocapture gold microarray on which users will print their own biological content 
we envision that future generations of nanocapture arrays will have specific surface chemistry to enable  and in some cases  enhance the biological assay 
ultimately  we believe we will generate a significantly more valuable consumable by providing the customer with biological content on the microarray 
in early  we acquired exclusive rights within our markets to helix biopharma s heterodimer protein technology hpt which was recently branded with the trade name expresstag 
we believe this technology gives us the necessary basis by which to provide biological content on the microarray  specifically because expresstag enables proteins to properly orient on a surface allowing them to maintain function 
the traditional commercial markets eg  large pharmaceutical companies and biotech companies look to recognized research organizations and universities for development and validation of core research methodologies 
our commercialization strategy is to place a number of pre commercial devices with our collaboration partners and research institutions to generate data useful for external validation  to speed application development efforts and to strengthen the functionality of our upcoming commercial release 
demonstrating the value of our products through these opinion leaders will  therefore  allow us to be in a stronger position when we enter these commercial markets 
in we entered into a collaboration agreement with the institute for systems biology isb  an internationally renowned non profit research institute dedicated to the study and application of systems biology 
this agreement was extended in and is now focused on biomarker discovery  specifically with identifying biomarkers associated with drug induced liver injury 
early results suggest that lumera s proteomicprocessor platform can be used to identify new biomarkers 
experiments are ongoing to further quantify and validate the results 
our collaboration with the harvard university medical school harvard  which began informally in early  is focused on integrating harvard s nappa nucleic acid programmable protein array technology  which provides a simple and cost effective way to generate a protein biochip  with the proteomicprocessor to read and analyze the biochip 
in october  we released an update on dr 
labaer s work in connection with the proteomicprocessor 
successful integration of nappa on the proteomicprocessor was presented by harvard researchers at the peptalk conference in january follow on research is focused on developing a new protein biochip containing kinase proteins for use in both kinase interaction studies as well as kinase inhibitor studies 
currently our beta release devices are installed at the institute for systems biology  harvard  the medical university of south carolina and baylor institute for immunology research 
additional academic  as well as select commercial beta sites  have expressed an interest in the system 
our life sciences product development and manufacturing team is focused on bringing all of the necessary features and functions to provide the market with a competitive product 
we continue to work through a number of outstanding issues  which are demanding much of the team s focus  including vendor qualification and building required quality control processes 
electro optics segment the market we believe that the increasing demand for faster  higher bandwidth communications applications will ultimately stimulate demand for components that can operate at these faster parameters 
electro optic devices such as modulators translate electric signals into optical signals used in communication systems to transfer data  either over fiber optic networks or between chip based circuits  acting like high speed switches 
optical data transfer is significantly faster and more efficient than transfer technologies using only electric signals 
current technologies that translate electric signals into optical signals generally rely on inorganic electro optic materials which have speed limitations and require higher operating voltages that in turn increase operating temperatures and systems costs 
polymer based electro optic modulators appear to provide advantages over current switching technologies based on inorganic materials by increasing switching speed  improving optical transmission properties and lowering operating voltages 
higher switching speeds will permit more cost effective use of bandwidth for broadband internet and voice services 
lower operating voltages may enable systems design to eliminate costs and importantly to reduce the heat these systems generate 
polymer modulators are also resistant to radiation  making them highly suitable for satellite communications 
we anticipate that an additional market for electro optic devices may develop in connection with computer components 
some integrated circuit manufacturers are seeking to solve problems that exist with metal interconnects  which are used to move data directly from microprocessors to other computer components 
metal interconnects may become more problematic as processor speeds continue to increase 
in particular  as speeds increase  it is likely that heat transfer will become a more serious issue to address 
unlike many metal interconnects  polymer based interconnects can operate at higher circuit speeds by optically transmitting data between computer components and systems 
because the data is being transferred via light  the heat transfer issue is also resolved 
there is a growing need in wireless applications for high frequency signals in the millimeter wave range ghz to ghz that are generated coherently 
certain high frequencies in this range are attractive for wireless communications since this spectrum can be used to achieve transmission of ultra high data transfer gbps 
examples of high data transfer uses are transmission of uncompressed high definition video content  high speed communication between space or airborne platforms  communications between flight vehicles and ground operations  and temporary restoration of communications infrastructure in a disaster recovery scenario 
thus far  no solution has been developed to address the technical need to serve these applications in a commercially viable way 
by creating a millimeter wave signal in the optical domain  one can generate a coherent signal that is essential for high data rate gbps wireless transmission 
modulating the signal in the optical domain allows one to leverage industry standard optical modulation and filtering capabilities already widely deployed in the fiber optic communications infrastructure 
this approach takes advantage of lower frequency and lower cost electronic components 
we believe our polymeric electro optic materials show great advantages for these applications due to their ability of achieving large bandwidth with low driving voltages and processing capabilities in arrays of communications devices with low cross talk 
this market is still evolving but is believed capable of becoming quite large as the need for greater bandwidth continues to accelerate 
companies that are spread between multiple buildings either in a campus setting or within a metropolitan area and transmit backup files of customer data  billing data  etc 
would be interested in the ability to service higher traffic loads 
similarly  universities  health care enterprises  and government agencies have high data capacity users 
moreover  in many undeveloped countries  where no fiber optic infrastructure exists  a wireless solution can become a very attractive broadband connectivity option as the wireless bridge offers high data rate transmission at low cost in an integrated solution  while avoiding the expense of digging and laying optical fiber 
lumera electro optic product opportunity we are developing a new generation of electro optic modulators and other devices for optical networks and systems based on our proprietary polymer materials 
the applications for these advanced materials include electro optic components such as modulators and ring oscillators  polymer electronics such as high performance diodes and transistors  and optical interconnects for high speed greater than billion cycles per second inter and intra semiconductor chip communication 
our polymer based modulators can operate at speeds up to five times faster than existing inorganic crystalline based electro optic modulators and are smaller  lighter and more energy efficient than electro optic modulators using inorganic crystals 
we have designed and manufactured polymer based electro optic modulators that operate at speeds up to ghz 
we are continuing development efforts to enhance the speed  efficiency and power requirements of electro optic materials and devices to meet evolving customer requirements and applications 
we are also developing millimeter wave systems which could be used in wireless communication systems applications and in security related applications  offering high data rate wireless transmission at low cost compared to current last mile wire line infrastructure 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed testing of our prototype millimeter wave wireless bridge  successfully transmitting gbps at ghz through the use of gigabit ethernet and other standard protocols 
we also successfully tested a prototype of our multiband  high data rate adaptive millimeter wave communication system during the fourth quarter of potential customers for these systems include various telecommunications and broadcasting companies as well as defense and security agencies 
in july  the defense advanced research projects agency darpa awarded us an month  million contract which  based on the achievements of certain milestones  will be followed by a month  million contract for a total of million over a period of months  which could be shortened if milestone deliveries are accelerated 
the objective of the project is to provide high performance polymer optical modulators that are critical in leading edge defense applications  including terrestrial and satellite rf photonic links and phased array radar 
the scope of the month multi phase project  which can be shortened with acceleration of deliverables  involves developing materials with unprecedented electro optic coefficients  with qualified thermal and photo stability and processing them into devices 
the combination of reduced drive voltage and optical loss will enable defense applications that are impractical with currently available optical modulator technologies 
government research applications in addition to our polymer based electro optic products in development for commercial markets  we develop customized products on a contract basis for us government agencies and government subcontractors  including high performance electro optic modulators currently unavailable in the commercial market 
these development contracts provide us with revenues  help fund our research and development efforts  and provide access to certain technological resources of the government and government subcontractors 
we are currently working on contracts with government agencies to produce polymer based modulators for use in defense communications and detection systems and phased array radar 
in addition to the month darpa contract discussed above  in march  our longest running contract with a government agency  under which we have been paid a total of million since  was renewed for a total of million for development work through march backlog on our governmental contracts totaled  at december  summary of applications and product development the following table summarizes our target markets  our current and potential products and the initial applications for these products

because we recognize that our products and technologies propose new  disruptive methods  we will continue to seek relationships and partnerships with world opinion leaders in their respective fields 
doing so  we believe  will allow our products and technologies to be validated by these respected leaders 
we also believe these partnerships will provide valuable introductions to the commercial markets we seek to penetrate 
leverage government contracts for technology advantage 
we plan to continue to pursue government contracts to stay at the forefront of polymer materials technology advances 
we believe the expertise we gain from government contract work will expand our proprietary knowledge  which we can use to develop products for commercial applications 
maintain and broaden our relationships with leading research facilities and personnel 
our relationships with academic institutions and their personnel have been critical to building our technology portfolio and our polymer materials expertise 
we intend to continue these types of relationships to access novel technologies and achieve competitive advantages 
develop a multi channel sales and marketing organization

the georgia tech professors are also principals of azm 
we sponsored approximately  and  during  and  respectively of research related to development of optical materials under the terms of a separate letter agreements 
patents and other intellectual property we develop and exploit technologies relating to polymers and related materials 
we have patents and patents pending covering technologies relating to polymer synthesis at the molecular level  production of polymers in commercial quantities  materials systems incorporating polymers  materials characterization and testing methods  and devices  designs and processes relating to polymers 
use of mems based optical systems for biodetection  methods for anchoring proteins to a planar surface  competitive assay for small molecule detection as a small company seeking to market and sell novel products in new markets  we believe that a robust technology portfolio is an essential element of our business strategy 
accordingly  we believe that our success will depend in large part on our ability to obtain patent and other proprietary protection for the materials  processes and device designs that we develop  enforce and defend patents and other rights in technology  once obtained  operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties  and preserve our trade secrets 
patent portfolio 
our intellectual property consists principally of patentable inventions and trade secrets 
we have developed some of this intellectual property internally and have also acquired intellectual property from our strategic partners and others 
we and our strategic partners protect our intellectual property by filing domestic and foreign patent applications where appropriate and by maintaining an active program designed to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets 
with respect to inventions and other intellectual property created under our development contracts with the us government and government contractors  we typically have the right to retain title to any patents that issue to us in connection with the performance of these contracts  with the government retaining a non exclusive license to use the patented technology for government purposes 
the government typically also retains rights in any technical data that we develop using federal funding and deliver under a development contract 
if we do not comply with government notice requirements with respect to inventions developed under these development contracts  the government could demand ownership of the inventions  in which case we would retain a license to use the inventions 
we have issued united states patents and approximately currently pending united states patent applications  of which have received notices of allowance 
our patent and patent applications are directed to polymer and small molecule materials  methods of making materials  processing of materials  processing of devices  device designs and microarray analysis methods 
we also have an exclusive sublicense in the field of electro optic polymers to the rights to seven patents from arizona microsystems and have licensed patent applications covering technology from the university of washington 
in connection with our transaction with sensium  we licensed three us patents and rights under patents granted under two additional us patent applications  each of which patents has various corresponding international patents 
our patents will begin to expire in patent valuation 
while we believe our patent portfolio to be a valuable asset  the discoveries or technologies covered by the patents and patent applications we own or license may not have commercial value 
also  issued patents may not provide commercially meaningful protection against competitors 
other parties may be able to design around our issued patents or independently develop technology having effects similar or identical to our patented technology 
in addition  the scope of our patents and patent applications is subject to uncertainty and competitors or other parties may obtain similar patents of uncertain scope 
for example  other parties may discover uses for polymers or technology different from the uses covered in our patents or patent applications  and these other uses may be separately patentable 
also  other parties may have patents covering the composition of polymers for which we have patents or patent applications covering only methods of use of these polymers 
third parties may infringe the patents that we own or license  or claim that our potential products or related technologies infringe their patents 
any patent infringement claims that might be brought by or against us may cause us to incur significant expenses  divert the attention of our management and key personnel from other business concerns and  if successfully asserted against us  require us to pay substantial damages 
in addition  a patent infringement suit against us could force us to stop or delay developing  manufacturing or selling potential products that are claimed to infringe a patent covering a third party s intellectual property 
trade secrets 
in addition to our patented intellectual property  we also rely on unpatented technology  trade secrets and confidential information 
we require each of our employees and consultants to execute a confidentiality agreement before beginning their employment or consulting relationship with us 
these agreements generally provide that the individual must keep confidential and not disclose to other parties any confidential information developed or learned by the individual during the course of his or her relationship with us 
our agreements with employees provide that any intellectual property developed by the employee during the course of his or her employment is automatically assigned to us 
our agreements with consultants generally provide that we have the option to exclusively license all inventions conceived by the consultant in the course of rendering services to us 
these agreements with employees and consultants may not provide effective protection of our technology or confidential information or  in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure  may not provide adequate remedies 
third parties 
as part of our business strategy we collaborate with third parties in our research and development activities 
accordingly  disputes may arise about inventorship and corresponding rights to know how and inventions resulting from the joint creation or joint use of intellectual property 
in addition  these third parties may circumvent any proprietary protection we do have 
they may independently develop equivalent technologies or independently gain access to and disclose substantially equivalent information  and confidentiality agreements and material transfer agreements we have entered into with them may not provide us with effective protection 
research and development process for both our bioscience and electro optic products  we have the ability to engineer  analyze  and test polymer materials and related devices as well as the ability to fabricate and test advanced products 
in march  we changed the organizational structure of our business to focus on our primary markets  creating two distinct business units bioscience and electro optics 
each business unit has specific technical service groups supporting our research and product development efforts materials and chemistry 
our materials and chemistry departments use existing synthesis methods as well as developing new methods to create novel polymer materials that meet electro optic and bioscience customer specifications 
once a polymer material has passed all of the commercial test parameters these departments develop new methods to synthesize larger quantities 
materials characterization and testing 
our materials characterization and testing department conducts a full battery of tests at the completion of the synthesis of each new polymer material 
this department evaluates test data using a central database 
the department also helps create strategies to optimize materials to meet customer specifications 
process development and device fabrication 
our process development and device fabrication departments integrate data from the material characterization and testing department to fabricate electro optic devices ie the modulators  the biological chips 
and the proteomicprocessor 
this department analyzes testing results from electro optic device and the proteomicprocessor to refine and improve fabrication processes and methods 
in addition  the department works closely with the other departments  providing technical proposals on how more efficient materials fabrication processes can help enable superior design 
device design  testing and packaging 
our device design  testing and packaging departments takes customer specifications and creates an initial device design for electro optics modulators and bioscience proteomicprocessor using simulation software 
following device fabrication  this department runs a series of optical and electronic tests and creates a report that provides our other departments with directions on enhancing performance in future generations of materials and processes 
the department also has the capability to package devices in pilot production quantities 
manufacturing we currently manufacture prototype devices and chips in our research facilities 
we expect that our in house facilities will be capable of producing sufficient product quantities to meet initial commercial quantities 
we may require additional capacity to meet anticipated further demand 
we are investigating leasing additional production laboratory space that would accommodate larger bio chip and polymer modulator volumes as well as enable polymer modulator production 
sales and marketing as our product commercialization efforts progress we are applying resources to become a customer focused organization 
we are aggressively pursuing sales and marketing of our products  targeting opinion market leaders and initial customers 
we currently have prototypes installed in a number of high profile beta test sites in each of our current target markets  which will serve to validate the instrument and chips  as well as create awareness about our technology 
we will leverage these expected initial sales with opinion and market leaders to obtain future contracts and sales references 
we are partnering with leading us research institutions and opinion leaders such as the institute of systems biology  the harvard institute of proteomics and others 
we are targeting life science research centers and universities for protein pathway basic discovery and are in discussions with biotech companies and large pharmaceutical companies interested in the mechanisms of molecular biology  protein protein interactions and networking  cell signaling  aging  disease and death 
we plan to reach these potential customers through targeted direct selling  followed by non exclusive co marketing partnerships 
in addition  we plan to advertise in trade journals  participate in targeted industry trade shows and organizations  engage in focused public relations campaigns  and make scientific presentations at technical conferences 
we have employees with experience in the marketing of polymer materials and related products 
our marketing professionals are focused on selling our bioscience biochips instruments and electro optic devices 
as our products advance in development  we expect to increase our marketing and sales resources 
in addition to using our own sales and marketing organization  we may promote our potential products with marketing partners 
we may also rely on relationships with companies with established distribution systems and direct sales forces to distribute and sell our products 
competition the markets that we are targeting for our polymer materials technologies are intensely competitive 
in the biotechnology disposables market  we expect to compete with tactical fabs  inc  erie scientific company and corning incorporated 
in the bioscience instrumentation and tools area we expect to compete with biacore ge healthcare  applera  agilent and others 
in the electro optic modulators market  we expect to compete with fujitsu limited  sumitomo osaka cement company  ltd  avanex  inc and jds uniphase corporation 
we believe the principal competitive factors affecting our markets are the ability to develop and commercialize polymer based products  including patent and proprietary rights protection  costs of these products  and ability to enable and improve performance 
although we believe that we are well positioned to compete adequately with respect to these factors  our future success is currently difficult to predict because we are an early stage company and all of our products are in early stages of development 
many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater research and product development capabilities and financial  scientific  marketing and human resources than we do 
as a result  these competitors may devote greater resources to developing  marketing or selling their products  succeed in developing superior products that achieve greater market acceptance than our potential products  respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or scientific advances and changes in customer requirements  which could render our technologies or potential products obsolete  introduce products that make the continued development of our products uneconomical  obtain patents that block or otherwise inhibit our ability to develop and commercialize our products  withstand price competition more successfully than we can  establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that enhance their ability to address the needs of our prospective customers  and take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily than we can 
government regulation we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation  handling  treatment  storage and disposal of certain toxic or hazardous materials and waste products that we use or generate in our operations 
we regularly assess our compliance with environmental laws and management of environmental matters 
we are also subject to federal procurement regulations associated with our us government contracts 
violations of these regulations can result in civil  criminal or administrative proceedings involving fines  compensatory and punitive damages  restitution and forfeitures as well as suspensions or prohibitions from entering into government contracts 
in addition  the reporting and appropriateness of costs and expenses under our government contracts are subject to extensive regulation and audit by the defense contract audit agency  an agency of the us department of defense 
the contracts and subcontracts to which we are a party are also subject to potential profit and cost limitations and standard provisions that allow the us government to terminate such contracts at its convenience 
we will be entitled to reimbursement of our allowable costs and to an allowance for earned profit if the contracts are terminated by the us government for convenience 
sales of our potential products and services internationally may be subject to the policies and approval of the us department of state and department of defense 
any international sales may also be subject to united states and foreign government regulations and procurement policies  including regulations relating to import export control  investments  exchange controls and repatriation of earnings 
employees as of december   we employed full time and part time employees 
our team of chemists  materials scientists  electrical engineers  and optical physicists includes phds from time to time  we also use independent contractors 
none of our employees is represented by collective bargaining arrangements 
to date  we have experienced no work stoppages  and we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 
item a 
risk factors we have incurred substantial operating losses since our inception and will continue to incur substantial operating losses for the foreseeable future 
since our inception  we have been engaged primarily in the research and development of our polymer materials technologies and potential products 
as a result of these activities  we incurred net losses of million from inception through december  and an additional net loss of million for the twelve months ended december  we anticipate that we will continue to incur operating losses through at least as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we may not be able to generate significant additional revenue either through development contracts from the us government or government subcontractors or through customer contracts for our potential products or technologies 
we expect to continue to make significant operating and capital expenditures for research and development and to improve and expand production  sales  marketing and administrative systems and processes 
as a result  we will need to generate significant additional revenue to achieve profitability 
we are subject to the risks frequently experienced by early stage companies 
the likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the risks frequently encountered by early stage companies  especially those formed to develop and market new technologies 
these risks include our potential inability to establish product sales and marketing capabilities  establish and maintain markets for our potential products  identify  attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  continue to develop and upgrade our technologies to keep pace with changes in technology and the growth of markets using polymer materials  develop expanded product production facilities and outside contractor relationships  maintain our reputation and build trust with customers  improve existing and implement new transaction processing  operational and financial systems  scale up from small pilot or prototype quantities to large quantities of product on a consistent basis  contract for or develop the internal skills needed to master large volume production of our products  and fund the capital expenditures required to develop volume production due to the limits of our available financial resources 
we are entering new markets  and if we fail to accurately predict growth in these new markets  we may suffer substantial losses 
we are devoting significant resources to the development of products and the support of marketing and sales efforts in new markets  such as the disposable biochip and broader proteomics markets 
we expect to continue to seek to identify and develop products for new markets 
new markets change rapidly and we cannot assure you that they will grow or that we will be able to accurately forecast market demand  or lack thereof  in time to respond appropriately 
our investment of resources to develop products for these markets may either be insufficient to meet actual demand or result in expenses that are excessive in light of actual sales volumes 
failure to predict growth and demand accurately in new markets may cause us to suffer substantial losses 
in addition  as we enter new markets  there is a significant risk that the market may not accept the price and or performance of our products  there may be issued patents we are not aware of that could block our entry into the market or result in excessive litigation  and the time required for us to achieve market acceptance of our products may exceed our capital resources  which would require additional investment 
the establishment and maintenance of original equipment manufacturer and other collaborative relationships is critical to the success of our business 
we expect to sell many of our products directly to research laboratories and commercial customers or through potential industry partners 
for example  we expect to offer disposable bio chips to research labs and customers who will use them in dna analysis and protein discovery 
our ability to generate revenues depends significantly on the extent to which potential customers and other potential industry partners develop  promote and sell systems that incorporate our products 
any failure by potential customers and other potential industry partners to successfully develop and market systems that incorporate our products could adversely affect our sales 
the extent to which potential customers and other industry partners develop  promote and sell systems incorporating our products is based on a number of factors that are largely beyond our ability to control 
our future growth will suffer if we do not achieve sufficient market acceptance of our products 
we are developing nanotechnology enhanced polymer based products 
we do not know when a market for these products will develop  if at all 
our success depends  in part  upon our ability to gain market acceptance of our products 
to be accepted  our products must meet the technical and performance requirements of our potential customers 
the biochip markets are evolving rapidly and involve many competitors and competing technologies  and the optical communications industry is currently fragmented with many competitors developing different technologies 
we expect that only a few of these technologies will ultimately gain market acceptance 
products based on polymer materials may not be accepted by oems and systems integrators of optical communications networks 
in addition  even if we achieve some degree of market acceptance for our potential products in one industry  we may not achieve market acceptance in other industries for which we are developing products 
if the markets we are targeting fail to accept polymer based products or determine that other products are superior  we may not be able to achieve market acceptance of our products 
all of our current products are either in the development stage or are being tested by potential customers 
we cannot assure you that these customer tests will be successful or that they will result in actual material sales of our products 
achieving market acceptance for our products will require marketing efforts and the expenditure of financial and other resources to create product awareness and demand by customers 
we may be unable to offer products that compete effectively due to our limited resources and operating history 
also  certain large corporations may be predisposed against doing business with a company of our limited size and operating history 
failure to achieve broad acceptance of our products by customers and to compete effectively would harm our operating results 
successful commercialization of our current and future products will require us to maintain a high level of technical expertise 
technology in our target markets is undergoing rapid change 
to succeed in our target markets  we will have to establish and maintain a leadership position in the technology supporting those markets 
accordingly  our success will depend on our ability to accurately predict the needs of our target customers and develop  in a timely manner  the technology required to support those needs  provide products that are not only technologically sophisticated but are also available at a price acceptable to customers and competitive with comparable products  establish and effectively defend our intellectual property  and enter into relationships with other companies that have developed complementary technology into which our products may be integrated 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve any of these objectives 
many of our products will have long sales cycles  which may cause us to expend resources without an acceptable financial return and which makes it difficult to plan our expenses and forecast our revenues 
many of our products will have long sales cycles that involve numerous steps  including initial customer contacts  specification writing  engineering design  prototype fabrication  pilot testing  regulatory approvals if needed  sales and marketing and commercial manufacture 
during this time  we may expend substantial financial resources and management time and effort without any assurance that product sales will result 
the anticipated long sales cycle for some of our products makes it difficult to predict the quarter in which sales may occur 
delays in sales may cause us to expend resources without an acceptable financial return and make it difficult to plan expenses and forecast revenues 
we may require additional capital to continue to fund our operations 
if we do not obtain additional capital  we may be required to substantially limit our operations 
our business does not presently generate the cash needed to finance our current and anticipated operations 
based on our current operating plan and budgeted cash requirements  we believe that we will be able to fund our operations at least through we will require additional capital to continue to fund our operations in future periods 
we expect that we will need to seek additional funding through public or private financings  including equity financings  and through other arrangements  including collaborative arrangements 
poor financial results  unanticipated expenses or unanticipated opportunities could require additional financing sooner than we expect 
such financing may be unavailable when we need it or may not be available on acceptable terms 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders may be reduced  and these securities may have rights superior to those of our common stock 
if adequate funds are not available to satisfy either short term or long term capital requirements  or if planned revenues are not generated  we may be required to limit our operations substantially 
these limitations of operations may include reductions in capital expenditures and reductions in staff and discretionary costs 
we currently rely heavily on a small number of development contracts with the us department of defense and government contractors 
the termination or non renewal of one or more of these contracts could significantly reduce our revenue 
in   and    and  respectively  of our revenue was derived from performance on a limited number of development contracts with various agencies within the us department of defense 
any significant disruption or deterioration of our relationships with the department of defense could significantly reduce our revenues 
our government programs must compete with programs managed by other contractors for limited amounts and uncertain levels of funding 
the total amount and levels of funding are susceptible to significant fluctuations on a year to year basis 
our competitors frequently engage in efforts to expand their business relationships with the government and are likely to continue these efforts in the future 
in addition  our development contracts with government agencies are subject to potential profit and cost limitations and standard provisions that allow the us government to terminate such contracts at any time at its convenience 
termination of our development contracts  a shift in government spending to other programs in which we are not involved  or a reduction in government spending generally or defense spending specifically could severely harm our business 
we intend to continue to compete for government contracts and we expect such contracts will be a significant percentage of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
our development contracts with various agencies within the us department of defense require ongoing compliance with applicable federal procurement regulations 
violations of these regulations can result in civil  criminal or administrative proceedings involving fines  compensatory and punitive damages  restitution and forfeitures  as well as suspensions or prohibitions from entering into such development contracts 
also  the reporting and appropriateness of costs and expenses under these development contracts are subject to extensive regulation and audit by the defense contract audit agency  an agency of the us department of defense 
any failure to comply with applicable government regulations could jeopardize our development contracts and otherwise harm our business 
some of our products in development are directed at the telecommunications and networking markets  which continue to be subject to overcapacity and slow growth or decline 
we intend over the next several years to derive a substantial portion of our revenues from the sale of electro optic devices to the telecommunications and networking markets 
we have not yet made material sustainable commercial sales of these products  and developments that adversely affect the telecommunications or networking markets  including delays in traffic growth and changes in us government regulation  could halt our efforts to generate revenue or cause revenue growth to be slower than anticipated from sales of electro optic modulators and related products 
reduced spending and technology investment by telecommunications companies may make it more difficult for our products to gain market acceptance 
such companies may be less willing to purchase new technology such as ours or invest in new technology development when they have reduced capital expenditure budgets 
our quarter to quarter performance may vary substantially  and this variance  as well as general market conditions  may cause our stock price to fluctuate greatly and potentially expose us to litigation 
substantially all of our revenues to date have been generated from a limited number of development contracts with the us government and government contractors 
our revenues have varied significantly based on when government contracts commence or end and whether they receive funding appropriations 
because we intend to expand into commercial sales of our potential products  we are unable to accurately estimate future quarterly revenue and operating expenses based on historical performance 
our quarterly operating results may vary significantly based on many factors  including reductions or delays in funding of development programs involving new polymer materials technologies by the us government  additions of new customers  fluctuating demand for our potential products and technologies  announcements or implementation by our competitors of technological innovations or new products  the status of particular development programs and the timing of performance under specific development agreements  timing and amounts relating to the expansion of our operations  and costs related to possible future acquisitions of technologies or businesses 
our current and future expense estimates are based  in large part  on estimates of future revenue  which is difficult to predict 
we expect to continue to make significant operating and capital expenditures in the area of research and development and to invest in and expand production  sales  marketing and administrative systems and processes 
we may be unable to  or may elect not to  adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected revenue shortfall 
if our increased expenses are not accompanied by increased revenue in the same quarter  our quarterly operating results would be harmed 
in one or more future quarters  our results of operations may fall below the expectations of investors and the trading price of our common stock may decline as a consequence 
we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results will not be a good indication of our future performance and should not be relied upon to predict the future performance of our stock price 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have often been subject to securities class action litigation 
we may be the target of this type of litigation in the future 
securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention from other business concerns  which could seriously harm our business 
we cannot predict the pace of marketable products we may generate  and any inability to generate a sufficient number of marketable products would reduce our revenues and harm our business 
our future revenues and profitability are dependent upon our ability to create marketable products  whether through our own research and development efforts or through collaborations with customers or industry partners 
because of the inherently uncertain nature of research and development activities  we cannot predict the pace of new product introductions 
we must undertake additional research and development before we are able to develop additional products for commercial sale 
product development delays by us or potential product development partners  or the inability to enter into relationships with these potential partners  may delay or prevent us from introducing products for commercial sale 
in addition  our product candidates may not result in products having the commercial potential we anticipate 
any of these factors could reduce our potential commercial sales and lead to inability to generate revenue and attain profitability 
the failure to compete successfully could harm our business 
we expect to face competitive pressures from a variety of companies in each of our target markets 
some of our present and potential competitors have or may have substantially greater research and product development capabilities  financial  scientific  marketing  manufacturing and human resources  name recognition and experience than we have 
as a result  these competitors may succeed in developing products that are equal to or superior to our potential products or that will achieve greater market acceptance than our potential products  devote greater resources to developing  marketing or selling their products  respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or scientific advances and changes in customer requirements  which could render our technologies or potential products obsolete  introduce products that make the continued development of our potential products uneconomical  obtain patents that block or otherwise inhibit our ability to develop and commercialize our potential products  withstand price competition more successfully than we can  establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that enhance their ability to address the needs of our prospective customers  and take advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities more readily than we can 
the failure to compete successfully against these existing or future competitors could harm our business 
we may be unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities necessary to successfully commercialize our potential products 
we currently have limited sales and marketing capabilities 
to date  we have relied on sales and marketing leadership from our chief executive officer  mr 
mino  and our vice president of sales and marketing  mr 
lykken 
we will need to either hire more sales personnel with expertise in the markets we intend to address or contract with others to provide for sales support 
although our potential products are all based on our polymer materials technology  the potential products themselves address different markets and can be offered through multiple sales channels 
addressing each market effectively will require sales and marketing resources tailored to the particular market and to the sales channels that we choose to employ 
in addition  the markets in which we operate are highly complex and technical  we may not have sufficient expertise to adequately market our products 
we may be unable to establish marketing and sales capabilities necessary to commercialize and gain market acceptance for our potential products 
co promotion or other marketing arrangements with others to commercialize products could significantly limit the revenues we derive from these products  and these parties may fail to commercialize such products successfully 
we may be unable to obtain effective intellectual property protection for our potential products and technology 
our intellectual property  or any intellectual property that we have or may acquire  license or develop in the future  may not provide meaningful competitive advantages 
our patents and patent applications  including those we license  may be challenged by competitors  and the rights granted under such patents or patent applications may not provide meaningful proprietary protection 
for example  we are aware of numerous patents held by third parties that relate to polymer materials  biochips and electro optic devices 
these patents could be used as a basis to challenge the validity or limit the scope of our patents or patent applications 
a successful challenge to the validity or limitation of the scope of our patents or patent applications could limit our ability to commercialize our polymer materials technology and  consequently  reduce our revenues 
moreover  competitors may infringe our patents or those that we license  or successfully avoid these patents through design innovation 
to combat infringement or unauthorized use  we may need to resort to litigation  which can be expensive and time consuming and may not succeed in protecting our proprietary rights 
in addition  in an infringement proceeding  a court may decide that our patents or other intellectual property rights are not valid or are unenforceable  or may refuse to stop the other party from using the intellectual property at issue on the ground that it is non infringing 
policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and expensive  and we may not be able to  or have the resources to  prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights  particularly in countries where the laws may not protect these rights as fully as the laws of the united states 
we also rely on the law of trade secrets to protect unpatented technology and know how 
we try to protect this technology and know how by limiting access to those employees  contractors and strategic partners with a need to know this information and by entering into confidentiality agreements with these parties 
any of these parties could breach the agreements and disclose our trade secrets or confidential information to our competitors  or these competitors might learn of the information in other ways 
disclosure of any trade secret not protected by a patent could materially harm our business 
we may be subject to patent infringement claims  which could result in substantial costs and liability and prevent us from commercializing our potential products 
third parties may claim that our potential products or related technologies infringe their patents 
any patent infringement claims brought against us may cause us to incur significant expenses  divert the attention of our management and key personnel from other business concerns and  if successfully asserted against us  require us to pay substantial damages 
in addition  as a result of a patent infringement suit  we may be forced to stop or delay developing  manufacturing or selling potential products that are claimed to infringe a patent covering a third party s intellectual property unless that party grants us rights to use its intellectual property 
we may be unable to obtain these rights on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
even if we are able to obtain rights to a third party s patented intellectual property  these rights may be non exclusive  and therefore our competitors may obtain access to the same intellectual property 
ultimately  we may be unable to commercialize our potential products or may have to cease some of our business operations as a result of patent infringement claims  which could severely harm our business 
if our potential products infringe the intellectual property rights of others  we may be required to indemnify customers for any damages they suffer 
third parties may assert infringement claims against our current or potential customers 
these claims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of customers  regardless of the merits of these claims 
if any of these claims succeed  we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of these customers or may be required to obtain licenses for the products they use 
if we cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms  we may be unable to continue selling such products 
the technology we license from various third parties may be subject to government rights and retained rights of the originating research institution 
we license technology from the university of washington and various other research institutions or companies 
many of our partners and licensors have obligations to government agencies or universities 
under their agreements  a government agency or university may obtain certain rights over the technology that we have developed and licensed  including the right to require that a compulsory license be granted to one or more third parties selected by the government agency 
in addition  our partners often retain certain rights under their licensing agreement with us  including the right to use the technology for noncommercial academic and research use  to publish general scientific findings from research related to the technology  and to make customary scientific and scholarly disclosures of information relating to the technology 
it is difficult to monitor whether our partners limit their use of the technology to these uses  and we could incur substantial expenses to enforce our rights to our licensed technology in the event of misuse 
the loss of our chief executive officer  or any inability to attract and retain additional personnel  could impair our ability to maintain or expand our business 
our future success depends to a significant extent on the continued service of our key management personnel  particularly thomas d 
mino  our chief executive officer 
we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our executive officers other than mr 
mino and do not intend to purchase any in the future 
our future success will also depend on our ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled personnel 
in particular  we will need to hire a significant number of technical personnel 
competition for highly educated qualified personnel in the polymer as well as bio tech industries is intense 
if we fail to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified engineering  sales and technical personnel  we will not be able to maintain or expand our business 
if we fail to develop and maintain the quality of our manufacturing processes  our operating results would be harmed 
the manufacture of our potential products is a multi stage process that requires the use of high quality materials and advanced manufacturing technologies 
also  polymer related device development and manufacturing must occur in a highly controlled  clean environment to minimize particles and other yield and quality limiting contaminants 
in spite of stringent quality controls  weaknesses in process control or minute impurities in materials may cause a substantial percentage of a product in a lot to be defective 
if we are not able to develop and continue to improve on our manufacturing processes or to maintain stringent quality controls  or if contamination problems arise  our operating results would be harmed 
if we decide to make commercial quantities of products at our facilities  we may be required to make significant capital expenditures to increase capacity or purchase wafers or components from contract manufacturers 
we lack the internal ability to manufacture products at a level beyond the stage of early commercial introduction 
to the extent we do not have an outside vendor to manufacture our products  we will have to increase our internal production capacity and we will be required to expand our existing facilities or to lease or construct new facilities or to acquire entities with additional production capacities 
these activities would require us to make significant capital investments and may require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
we cannot assure you that such financing would be available to us when needed on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to expand internal production capacity on a timely basis to meet increases in demand  we could lose market opportunities for sales 
further  we cannot assure you that any increased demand for our potential products would continue for a sufficient period of time to recoup our capital investments associated with increasing our internal production capacity 
in addition  we do not have experience manufacturing our potential products in large quantities 
in the event of significant demand for our potential products  large scale production might prove more difficult or costly than we anticipate and lead to quality control issues and production delays 
we may not be able to manufacture products at competitive prices 
to date  we have produced limited quantities of products for research  development and demonstration purposes 
the cost per unit for these products currently exceeds the price at which we could expect to profitably sell them 
if we cannot substantially lower our cost of production as we move into sales of products in commercial quantities  our financial results will be harmed 
we conduct all of our operations at a single facility  and circumstances beyond our control may result in significant interruptions 
we conduct all of our research and development  internal manufacturing and management activities at a single facility in bothell  washington 
a disaster such as a fire  flood  earthquake  volcanic eruption or severe storm at or near this facility could prevent us from further developing our technologies or manufacturing our potential products  which would harm our business 
we could be exposed to significant product liability claims that could be time consuming and costly and impair our ability to obtain and maintain insurance coverage 
we may be subject to product liability claims if any of our potential products are alleged to be defective or harmful 
product liability claims or other claims related to our potential products  regardless of their outcome  could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation  divert our management s time and attention from other business concerns  require us to pay significant damages  harm our reputation or hinder acceptance of our potential products 
any successful product liability claim may prevent us from obtaining adequate product liability insurance in the future on commercially reasonable terms 
any inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or otherwise to protect against potential product liability claims could impair our ability to commercialize our potential products 
if we fail to effectively manage our growth  our business could suffer 
failure to manage our growth could harm our business 
to date  substantially all of our activities and resources have been directed at the research and development of our technology and development of potential products 
the transition from research and development to a vendor of products will require effective planning and management 
in addition  future expansion will be expensive and will likely strain our management and other resources 
in order to effectively manage growth  we must continue to develop an effective planning and management process to implement our business strategy  hire  train and integrate new personnel in all areas of our business  and expand our facilities and increase our capital investments 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to accomplish these tasks effectively or otherwise effectively manage our growth 
we are subject to regulatory compliance related to our operations 
we are subject to various us governmental regulations related to occupational safety and health  labor and business practices 
failure to comply with current or future regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines  suspension of production  alterations of our production processes  cessation of operations  or other actions  which could harm our business 
we may be unable to export our potential products or technology to other countries  convey information about our technology to citizens of other countries or sell certain products commercially  if the products or technology are subject to united states export or other regulations 
we are developing certain polymer based products that we believe the united states government and other governments may be interested in using for military and information gathering or antiterrorism activities 
united states government export regulations may restrict us from selling or exporting these potential products into other countries  exporting our technology to those countries  conveying information about our technology to citizens of other countries or selling these potential products to commercial customers 
we may be unable to obtain export licenses for products or technology if necessary 
we currently cannot assess whether national security concerns would affect our potential products and  if so  what procedures and policies we would have to adopt to comply with applicable existing or future regulations 
we may incur liability arising from the use of hazardous materials 
our business and our facilities are subject to a number of federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation  handling  treatment  storage and disposal of certain toxic or hazardous materials and waste products that we use or generate in our operations 
many of these environmental laws and regulations subject current or previous owners or occupiers of land to liability for the costs of investigation  removal or remediation of hazardous materials 
in addition  these laws and regulations typically impose liability regardless of whether the owner or occupier knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of any hazardous materials and regardless of whether the actions that led to the presence were taken in compliance with the law 
in our business  we use hazardous materials that are stored on site 
we use various chemicals in our manufacturing process which may be toxic and covered by various environmental controls 
the waste created by use of these materials is transported off site by an unaffiliated waste hauler 
many environmental laws and regulations require generators of waste to take remedial actions at an off site disposal location even if the disposal was conducted lawfully 
the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex  change frequently and could become more stringent in the future 
failure to comply with current or future environmental laws and regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines  suspension of production  alteration of our production processes  cessation of operations or other actions  which could severely harm our business 
acquisitions or investments may be unsuccessful and may divert our management s attention and consume significant resources 
we may in the future acquire or make investments in other businesses as well as products and technologies to complement our current business 
any future acquisition or investment may require us to use significant amounts of cash  make potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or incur debt 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  any of which could harm our business  including difficulties in integrating the operations  technologies and personnel of acquired businesses  diversion of our management s attention from other business concerns  unavailability of favorable financing for future acquisitions  potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses  inability to maintain the key business relationships and the reputations of acquired businesses  responsibility for liabilities of acquired businesses  inability to maintain our standards  controls  procedures and policies  and increased fixed costs 
our plan to develop relationships with strategic partners may not be successful 
as part of our business strategy  we have developed relationships and entered into agreements with strategic partners  such as with helix biopharma  the university of washington and arizona microsystems  to conduct research and development of technologies and products 
we expect to continue to evaluate similar opportunities 
for these efforts to be successful  we must identify partners whose competencies complement ours 
we must also successfully enter into agreements with them on terms attractive to us  and integrate and coordinate their resources and capabilities with our own 
we may be unsuccessful in entering into agreements with acceptable partners or negotiating favorable terms in these agreements 
also  we may be unsuccessful in integrating the resources or capabilities of these partners 
in addition  our strategic partners may prove difficult to work with or less skilled than we originally expected 
if we are unsuccessful in our collaborative efforts  our ability to develop and market products could be severely limited 
as our business grows  if we need to establish global operations  we will be subject to various risks 
many of the markets that we propose to address are global and may require us to conduct foreign operations  including the establishment of sales  manufacturing and possible research and development facilities in other countries 
while the specific risks that will apply to these activities would depend on the circumstances  we could become subject to risks relating to foreign currency fluctuations  political and social unrest  local regulatory systems and varying standards for the protection of intellectual property 
the existence of any of these risks will complicate our business and may lead to unexpected and adverse effects on our business 
if we are required to conduct significant foreign operations  we will also need expertise in such operations  which we do not presently have 
our limited operating history makes financial forecasting difficult for us and for others that may publish estimates of our future financial results 
as a result of our limited operating history  it is difficult to accurately forecast our revenue and results  including product sales and government contract revenue  cost of revenue  research and development expenses  marketing  general and administrative expenses and other financial and operating data 
we have a limited amount of meaningful historical financial data upon which to base projected revenue or expenses 
we base our current expense levels and estimates of future expense levels on our operating plans and estimates of future revenue  and our future expenses will be dependent in large part upon our future levels of product sales 
sales and results are difficult to forecast because we do not currently have any commercial customers  we are uncertain of the extent of orders for our products and the mix  volume and timing of any such orders  and we are uncertain of the receipt of and extent of performance under government contracts 
as a result  we may be unable to make accurate financial forecasts of revenue or expenses 
financial analysts and others that may seek to project our future performance face similar difficulties 
this inability to accurately forecast our revenue and expenses could cause our financial results to differ materially from any projected financial results and could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock

overview we were established in to develop proprietary polymer materials and products based on these materials 
we are currently developing products for two primary markets bioscience and electro optics 
we design and synthesize polymer materials at the molecular level by using our expertise in nanotechnology  which is the development of products and production processes at a scale smaller than nanometers a nanometer is one billionth of a meter 
our goal is to optimize the electrical  optical and surface properties of these materials 
we use these materials to improve the design  performance and functionality of products for use in biochemical analysis and in optical communications networks and systems 
we believe we have developed a proprietary intellectual property position based on a combination of patents  licenses and trade secrets relating to the design and characterization of polymer materials  methods of polymer synthesis and production of polymers in commercial quantities  as well as device design  characterization  fabrication  testing and packaging technology 
from our inception through december   we were considered to be in the development stage concentrating primarily on the development of our technology and potential products 
products for wireless networking and biochip applications became available for customer evaluation in early  therefore  we were considered to have exited the development stage in to date  substantially all of our revenues have come from contracts to develop custom made electro optic materials and devices for government agencies 
as we transition to a product based company  we expect to record both revenue and expense from product sales  and to incur increased costs for sales and marketing and to increase general and administrative expense 
accordingly  the financial condition and results of operations reflected in our historical financial statements are not expected to be indicative of our future financial condition and results of operations 
in  we also began the development of our label free  high throughput detection system and related biochip products aimed primarily at the growing proteomics marketplace 
we also continued the development of our polymer modulators  and pending demand for higher bandwidth and speeds from optical communications equipment suppliers  we have been developing other applications for our modulators such as millimeter wave detection and communication systems 
we currently have products being evaluated by customers and potential customers in each of our product areas 
we were a subsidiary of microvision  inc from our inception in early through our public offering in july until december   we obtained certain administrative services from microvision through an inter company services arrangement 
our facilities were subleased from microvision through april  we entered into a direct lease agreement which expanded our current facility on april  we no longer have any agreements with microvision other than certain purchase agreements pursuant to which we purchase certain electronic components at fair market value 
the following table reflects payments made to microvision for electronic components and other services under the former microvision agreement during   and electronic components rent allocated services fees total during march of  we changed the organizational structure of our business to focus on our primary markets  creating two distinct business segments bioscience and electro optics 
the status of our product commercialization efforts in each of our business segments is summarized below 
bioscience segment we are developing a high throughput surface plasmon resonance spr biosensor designed to enable discovery and characterization of proteins 
in addition  the system is being designed to characterize possible drug candidates that target protein molecules and to facilitate biomarker discovery and protein pathway elucidation 
lumera s competitive advantage is expected to be the ability to provide researchers kinetic information about protein interactions in a label free and high throughput format 
our nanocapture arrays are a family of microarrays targeting specific applications 
our initial product is expected to be a nanocapture gold microarray on which users will print their own biological content 
we envision that future generations of nanocapture arrays will have specific surface chemistry to enable and in some cases enhance the biological assay 
ultimately  we believe we will generate a significantly more valuable consumable 
in early  we acquired exclusive rights within our markets to helix biopharma s heterodimer protein technology hpt which was recently branded with the trade name expresstag 
we believe this technology gives us the necessary basis by which to provide biological content on the microarray  specifically because expresstag enables proteins to properly orient on a surface allowing them to maintain function 
the traditional commercial markets eg  large pharmaceutical companies and biotech companies look to recognized research organizations and universities for development and validation of core research methodologies 
our commercialization strategy is to place a number of pre commercial devices with our collaboration partners and research institutions to generate data useful for external validation  to speed application development efforts and to strengthen the functionality of our upcoming commercial release 
demonstrating the value of our products through these opinion leaders will  therefore  allow us to be in a stronger position when we enter these commercial markets 
in we entered into a collaboration agreement with the institute for systems biology isb  an internationally renowned non profit research institute dedicated to the study and application of systems biology 
this agreement was extended in and is now focused on biomarker discovery  specifically with identifying biomarkers associated with drug induced liver injury 
early results suggest that lumera s proteomicprocessor platform can be used to identify new biomarkers 
experiments are ongoing to further quantify and validate the results 
our collaboration with the harvard university medical school  which began informally in early  is focused on integrating harvard s nappa nucleic acid programmable protein array technology  which provides a simple and cost effective way to generate a protein biochip  with the proteomicprocessor to read and analyze the biochip 
in october  we released an update on dr 
labaer s work in connection with the proteomicprocessor 
successful integration of nappa on the proteomicprocessor was presented by harvard researchers at the peptalk conference in january follow on research is focused on developing a new protein biochip containing kinase proteins for use in both kinase interaction studies as well as kinase inhibitor studies 
currently our beta release devices are installed at the institute for systems biology  harvard  the medical university of south carolina and baylor institute for immunology research 
additional academic  as well as select commercial beta sites  have expressed an interest in the system 
our life sciences product development and manufacturing team is focused on bringing all of the necessary features and functions to provide the market with a competitive product 
we continue to work through a number of outstanding issues  which are demanding much of the team s focus  including vendor qualification and building required quality control processes 
electro optics segment we are developing a new generation of electro optic modulators and other devices for optical networks and systems based on our proprietary polymer materials 
the applications for these advanced materials include electro optic components such as modulators and ring oscillators  polymer electronics such as high performance diodes and transistors  and optical interconnects for high speed greater than billion cycles per second inter and intra semiconductor chip communication 
our polymer based modulators can operate at speeds up to five times faster than existing inorganic crystal based electro optic modulators and are smaller  lighter and more energy efficient than electro optic modulators using inorganic crystals 
we have designed and manufactured polymer based electro optic modulators that operate at speeds up to ghz 
we are continuing development efforts to enhance the speed  efficiency and power requirements of electro optic materials and devices to meet evolving customer requirements and applications 
we are also developing millimeter wave systems which could be used in wireless communication systems applications and in security related applications  offering high data rate wireless transmission at low cost compared to current last mile wire line infrastructure 
during the fourth quarter of we completed testing of our prototype millimeter wave wireless bridge  successfully transmitting gbps at ghz through the use of gigabit ethernet and other standard protocols 
we also successfully tested a prototype of our multiband  high data rate adaptive millimeter wave communication system during the fourth quarter of potential customers for these systems include various telecommunications and broadcasting companies as well as defense and security agencies 
we anticipate that commercial versions of our millimeter wave communications systems could be available within eighteen months 
in july  the defense advanced research projects agency darpa awarded us an month  million contract which  based on the achievements of certain milestones  will be followed by a month  million contract for a total of million over months  less if milestones deliveries are accelerated 
the objective of the project is to provide high performance polymer optical modulators that are critical in leading edge defense applications  including terrestrial and satellite rf photonic links and phased array radar 
the scope of the month multi phase project  which can be shortened with acceleration of deliverables  involves developing materials with unprecedented electro optic coefficients  with qualified thermal and photo stability and processing them into devices 
the combination of reduced drive voltage and optical loss will enable defense applications that are impractical with currently available optical modulator technologies 
historically  substantially all electro optics segment revenue has been generated from cost plus fixed fee development contracts with several united states government agencies or with government contractors  primarily to develop specialized electro optic polymer materials and devices 
results of operations revenue 
substantially all of our revenue since inception has been generated from cost plus fixed fee development contracts with several united states government agencies or with government contractors 
our projects have primarily been to develop specialized electro optic polymer materials and devices 
the following table summarizes the various contract awards we have received since its inception and the related revenue recognized wideband polymer modulator polymer based linear modulator electrooptic organic polymer polymer based milimeter wave detection polymers w exc high electro optic coefficients other award revenue award revenue award revenue award revenue award revenue award revenue backlog on our governmental contracts totaled  at december  our revenue from government contracting has fluctuated year to year and we expect that future periods could also fluctuate significantly 
we also generate revenue through sales of our products to research institutes both private and in universities  original equipment manufacturers oems  drug discovery and or diagnostic companies  industry partners and through development contracts 
we expect that future revenue from us government contracts will decrease as a percentage of revenue and that product revenue from the sale of commercial products will increase both on a dollar basis and as a percentage of revenue in future years 
revenue from product shipments was less than of total revenues for all years 
cost of revenue 
historically  cost of revenue has consisted primarily of the direct and allocated indirect costs of performing on development contracts 
direct costs include labor  materials and other costs incurred directly in performing specific projects 
indirect costs include labor and other costs associated with our research and product development efforts and building our technical capabilities and capacity 
the cost of revenue can fluctuate substantially from period to period depending on the level of both the direct costs incurred in the performance of projects and the level of indirect costs incurred 
the cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue can fluctuate significantly from period to period depending on the contract mix  the cost of future planned products and the level of direct and indirect cost incurred 
cost of product revenue includes direct labor and material costs and allocated indirect costs 
we currently utilize our research and development facilities to manufacture our products until demand for these products justify separate manufacturing facilities 
indirect cost is allocated to the cost of product revenues based upon direct labor required during the manufacturing process  but only to the extent of product revenue 
we record product costs in excess of revenues as research and development costs 
we expect that cost of revenue on a dollar basis will increase in the future as a result of anticipated sales of products  additional development contract work that we expect to perform  and commensurate growth in our personnel and technical capacity required to perform on these contracts 
research and development expense 
research and development expense consists primarily of laboratory operations  outsourced development and processing work  research fees paid to the university of washington and other educational institutions for contract research  compensation for employees and contractors engaged in internal research and product development activities  costs incurred in acquiring and maintaining licenses  and related operating expenses 
a significant portion of our research and development expense through june related to cash payments and a grant of common stock pursuant to our sponsored research agreement with the university of washington the uw 
we issued  shares of common stock in january to uw  recognizing million of research and development expense through february cash payments under the sponsored research agreement  following several amendments  totaled million 
we have ongoing minimum royalty obligations required by a technology licensing agreement with the uw totaling  annually 
we are currently funding researchers at the uw and other institutions to conduct ongoing research activities on a project basis 
we expect to continue to incur substantial research and development expense to develop commercial products using polymer materials technology 
these expenses could increase as a result of continued development and commercialization of our polymer materials technology  including subcontracting work to potential development partners  expanding and equipping in house laboratories  acquiring rights to additional technologies  hiring additional technical and support personnel and pursuing other potential business opportunities 
marketing  general and administrative expense 
marketing  general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and support costs for management and administrative staff  and for other general and administrative costs  including accounting and legal fees  consulting fees and other operating expenses 
it also consists of costs associated with corporate awareness campaigns such as web site development and participation at trade shows  corporate communications initiatives and efforts with potential customers and joint venture partners to identify and evaluate product applications in which our technology could be integrated or otherwise used 
we expect marketing  general and administrative expense to increase in and beyond as we increase our product development and marketing staff to define  qualify  develop and market products that we commercialize  increase our sales staff to begin and develop customer relationships and sell our products in various geographies and marketplaces  and increase the level of corporate and administrative activity  including increases associated with our operation as a public company 
interest income 
interest income consists of earnings from investment securities 
dividend and interest income are recognized when earned 
realized gains and losses would be included in other income 
income taxes 
from inception through december   we have generated federal net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million and research and development credits of approximately million 
our net operating loss carry forwards begin expiring in through in some circumstances  as specified in the internal revenue code  a or more ownership change by certain combinations of our shareholders during any three year period would result in a limitation on our ability to use a portion of our net operating loss carry forwards 
we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of its potential future tax benefits 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  contract losses  bad debts  stock based compensation  income taxes  investments and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  terms of existing contracts  information provided by our current and prospective customers and strategic partners  information available from other outside sources  and on various other assumptions management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies require our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue as work progresses on long term  cost plus fixed fee and fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method  which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
we use this revenue recognition methodology because we can make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs 
recognized revenues are subject to revisions as the contracts progress to completion and actual revenue and cost become certain 
revisions in revenue estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revisions become known 
revenue from product shipments is recognized in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when there is sufficient evidence of an arrangement  the selling price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
revenue for product shipments is recognized upon acceptance of the product by the customer or expiration of the contractual acceptance period  after which there are no rights of return 
provisions are made for warranties at the time revenue is recorded 
warranty expense and the associated liability recorded was not material for any periods presented 
contract estimates we estimate contract costs based on the experience of our professional researchers  the experience we have obtained in our internal research efforts  and our performance on previous contracts 
we believe this allows us to reasonably estimate the tasks required and the contract costs  however  there are uncertainties in estimating these costs  such as the ability to identify precisely the underlying technical issues hindering development of the technology  the ability to predict all the technical factors that may affect successful completion of the proposed tasks  and the ability to retain researchers having enough experience to complete the proposed tasks in a timely manner 
should actual costs differ materially from our estimates  we may have to adjust the timing and amount of revenue we recognize 
to date  we have mitigated the risk of failing to perform under these contracts by negotiating best efforts provisions  which do not obligate us to complete contract deliverables 
stock based compensation we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
r  share based payment  fas r effective january  and have applied the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
sab issued by the sec in march prior to january   we accounted for stock based employee compensation arrangements on the intrinsic value method in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related amendments and interpretations and we accounted for equity instruments issued to non employees in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
we also complied with the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
which required fair value recognition for employee stock based compensation 
we adopted fas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation cost recognized in includes compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of fas  and compensation cost for all share based payments granted or modified subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of fas r 
we recorded  of employee stock based compensation in operating expenses for the year ended december   increasing our loss per share by 
we elected to continue using the accelerated method of expense recognition pursuant to fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans fin as we used previously under the disclosure only provisions of sfas previously measured but unrecognized compensation expense for all unvested options outstanding as of january  and share based payments granted subsequent to january   compensation expense  both based on the fair value on the date of grant  will be recognized on an accelerated basis over the requisite service period 
as of december   there was million of unrecognized compensation cost  net of expected forfeitures  with the majority of the remaining being recognized over the next four quarters 
going forward  stock compensation expenses may increase as we issue additional equity based awards to continue to attract and retain key employees 
we continue to use the black scholes option pricing model in determining the fair value of stock options  employing the following key assumptions 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
we do not anticipate declaring dividends in the foreseeable future 
the expected option term of years is based on the vesting terms of the respective options and a contractual life of ten years using the simplified method calculation as defined by sab expected volatility is determined by blending the annualized daily historical volatility of our stock price commensurate with the expected life of the option with volatility measures used by comparable peer companies 
our estimates of expected volatility rate ranged from to for the year ended december  our stock price volatility and option lives involve management s best estimates at that time  both of which impact the fair value of the option calculated under the black scholes methodology and  ultimately  the expense that will be recognized over the life of the option 
fas r also requires that we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of options or stock units that are expected to vest  therefore  we apply estimated forfeiture rates that are derived from historical employee termination behavior 
our estimated forfeiture rate is 
if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those we estimated  additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods 
we did not make any forfeiture related adjustments to compensation expense for the year ended december  we may modify the method in which we issue incentive awards to our employees through stock based compensation in future periods 
the impact of forfeitures on previously recognized compensation expense for unvested options at january   was immaterial  therefore  we have not recorded a cumulative effect adjustment related to the change in accounting principle

investing activities used million in cash in  provided cash totaling million in and used million in cash in during we funded our operating activities primarily with cash from investment maturities 
we invested approximately million in leasehold improvements and laboratory equipment in purchases of investment securities following our november financing more than offset cash provided for operating losses and capital expenditures 
the cash provided in was primarily due to the sale of investment securities  net of reinvestments 
the cash used in was primarily due to net investments of cash following our initial public offering in july historically  capital expenditures have been used to make leasehold improvements to leased office space and to purchase production equipment  computer hardware and software  laboratory equipment and furniture and fixtures to support our growth 
capital expenditures will decrease during due to the completion of leasehold improvements in our new facilities during financing activities

these notes were payable on demand upon completion of our initial public offering 
the warrants carry an exercise price of and expire in all of the notes were repaid following our july stock offering 
in july  we completed our ipo  raising million  net of underwriter s discounts and offering expenses 
forward looking statements 
our future expenditures and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the progress of our research and development efforts  the rate at which we can  directly or through arrangements with original equipment manufacturers  introduce and sell products incorporating our polymer materials technology  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  market acceptance of our products and competing technological developments  and our ability to establish cooperative development  joint venture and licensing arrangements 
we expect that our cash used in operations will increase during  compared to  and beyond as a result of increased production spending as our products are accepted and sold  increased spending on marketing activities as our products are introduced into our target markets  the addition of sales  marketing  technical and other staff to sell products  meet production needs and continue with future development efforts  purchases of additional laboratory and production equipment  the development of strategic relationships with systems and equipment manufacturers  and increased general and administrative activities related to our operations as a public company and related corporate compliance requirements 
our business does not presently generate the cash needed to finance our current and anticipated operations 
we expect that cash and investments held for sale  along with revenues from our existing contractual relationships  will be sufficient to fund our operations at least through the end of see item a risk factors 
we may seek additional funding through public or private financings  including equity financings  and through other arrangements  including collaborative arrangements 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders may be reduced  and these securities may have rights superior to those of our common stock 
contractual obligations 
the following table lists our contractual obligations as of december  payment due by period year ending december  there after contractual obligations building lease operating leases minimum payments under research  royalty and licensing agreements total royalty and license obligations continue through the lives of the underlying patents 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not use off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties  nor do we use other forms of off balance sheet arrangements such as special purpose entities and research and development arrangements 
accordingly  our liquidity and capital resources are not subject to off balance sheet risks from unconsolidated entities 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which provides criteria for the recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure of uncertain income tax positions 
a tax benefit from an uncertain income tax position may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable based on its technical merits 
the provisions of fin are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact that fin will have on our financial condition or results of operations 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  considering the effects of a prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  which allows for the adjustment of the cumulative effect of prior year immaterial errors in assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the fiscal year with an offsetting adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
there have been two common approaches used to quantify such errors 
under one approach  the error is quantified as the amount by which the current year income statement is misstated 
the other approach quantifies the error as the cumulative amount by which the current year balance sheet is misstated 
the adoption of sab  which is effective for annual financial statements covering the first fiscal year ending after november   did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in september of  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
this statement provides a single definition of fair value  together with a framework for measuring it  and requires additional disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement  and sets out a fair value hierarchy with the highest priority being quoted prices in active markets 
under the statement  fair value measurements are disclosed by level within that hierarchy 
while the statement does not add any new fair value measurements  it does change current practice 
changes to practice include a requirement for an entity to include its own credit standing in the measurement of its liabilities and to adjust the value of restricted stock for the effect of the restriction even if the restriction lapses within one year 
the statement is effective january  and is to be applied prospectively 
we are currently evaluating the impact that sfas no 
will have on our financial condition or results of operations  however  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact given our net operating losses 
in december  the fasb approved fasb staff position fsp no 
eitf  accounting for registration payment arrangements fsp eitf  which specifies that the contingent obligation to make future payments or otherwise transfer consideration under a registration payment arrangement  whether issued as a separate agreement or included as a provision of a financial instrument or other agreement  should be separately recognized and measure in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
fsp eitf also requires additional disclosure regarding the nature of any registration payment arrangements  alternative settlement methods  the maximum potential amount of consideration and the current carrying amount of the liability  if any 
this guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of fsp eitf is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings 
sfas no 
does not affect any existing accounting literature that requires certain assets and liabilities to be carried at fair value 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not expect our adoption of this new standard to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk substantially all of our cash equivalents and investment securities are at fixed interest rates  and as such  the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates 
due to the generally short term maturities of these investment securities  however  we believe that the market risk arising from our holdings of these financial instruments is not material 
our investment policy restricts investments to ensure principal preservation and liquidity 
we invest cash that we expect to use within approximately sixty days in money market funds and us treasury backed instruments 
we invest cash in excess of sixty days of our requirement in high quality investment securities 
the investment securities portfolio is limited to us government and us government agency debt securities and other liquid high grade securities generally with maturities of two years or less
