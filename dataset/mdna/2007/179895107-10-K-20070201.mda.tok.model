fiscal was a week year compared to fiscal which was a week year 
fiscal sales  operating profit and net earnings increased from fiscal by  and  respectively 
on a same weeks basis  the increases were approximately  and 
operating margins improved to in continued strong demand  both domestically and internationally  for heavy duty engine filtration products used in both on road and off road applications  and for filters used in diesel locomotive applications and increased demand for filter products used in off shore oil drilling  aviation  aviation fuel  aerospace  resin and fiber applications  had a positive impact on sales and operating profit 
in addition  the company was able to increase prices to offset most cost increases for raw materials  freight  employee benefits and energy 
the company also improved capacity utilization and production efficiencies  particularly in its aviation cartridge filter manufacturing operations and in its packaging segment 

table of contents clarcor s financial position remains strong 
cash and short term investments increased from nearly million at the end of to over million at the end of even after repurchasing million of the company s common stock 
cash flow from operating activities totaled million  of which million was invested in plant asset additions and million was used to pay dividends to shareholders 
the following are significant items that occurred during the periods presented the company began a three year restructuring program for its heating  ventilating and air conditioning hvac operations  primarily to rationalize and relocate certain hvac manufacturing plants to improve operating efficiencies and reduce manufacturing and transportation costs 
although there was very little impact on results  the company expects to realize significant cost savings beginning in and continuing over the next several years 
see a further discussion of this program in the operating profit section of this analysis 
during fiscal  the company recorded a million charge to operating profit related to a customer s refusal to pay for products it had ordered and used 
in addition  the company terminated a million annual sales contract with this customer 
clarcor recognized stock option expense of million pre tax  or approximately per share  in no stock option expense was recorded in prior years 
in fiscal and  one time tax benefits in each year of approximately million  or per diluted share  reduced income tax expense 
the benefit in the third quarter resulted from the favorable settlement of a tax position related to a foreign subsidiary 
the fourth quarter benefit was due to the reversal of a foreign tax credit valuation allowance as a result of the american jobs creation act of operating results sales net sales in fiscal were million  a increase from million in fiscal the sales increase was the th consecutive year of sales growth for the company despite having one less week in than in  which reduced sales by approximately two percentage points or million 
acquisitions in the fourth quarter of and during contributed an incremental million to sales in fluctuations in foreign currencies impacted sales in by less than one percent 
comparative net sales information related to clarcor s operating segments is shown in the following tables 
fiscal and fiscal were fifty two week years  fiscal was a fifty three week year

change net sales total engine mobile filtration industrial environmental filtration packaging total vs 
change net sales total engine mobile filtration industrial environmental filtration packaging total 
table of contents the engine mobile filtration segment s sales increased in from and in from on a same weeks basis  sales increased approximately 
these increases were primarily due to additional sales of heavy duty filters through independent distributors  in both domestic and international aftermarkets  oem dealers  truck fleets and national accounts and sales to railroads and railroad equipment maintenance companies 
filter markets for on road trucks and for off road applications for construction  mining and agricultural equipment were strong 
sales of engine filters in overseas markets increased and were led by sales increases of over in china  europe and mexico 
new product introductions and the breadth of the segment s filter product line  as well as price increases which averaged to  contributed to sales growth in both years 
a small acquisition in contributed million of sales 
the additional fiscal week in added approximately million to fiscal sales 
changes in currency translation rates had little impact in either year 
the company s industrial environmental filtration segment reported a million or decrease in sales over  however  the additional week in added approximately million to fiscal sales 
therefore  on a same weeks basis  the segment s fiscal sales were slightly greater approximately than for this segment had to absorb the loss of million in annual sales to a customer who decided late in to begin manufacturing certain hvac filter products at its manufacturing plants outside the united states 
in addition  on march   the company terminated a million annual sales contract with electronic data systems corporation eds  which had refused to pay amounts of million owed to clarcor  which also negatively impacted sales 
the company has initiated legal proceedings against eds to recover amounts owed to the company plus associated costs and expenses and punitive damages 
acquisitions made during the fourth quarter of and during contributed approximately million of sales 
in addition  sales grew strongly in several specialty filtration markets  both in domestic and in international markets  including aviation fuel filtration systems  aerospace filters  dust collector cartridges  plastic and polymer applications  and rainwater runoff systems 
sales of filters sold into the oil and gas market were lower in both and as customer demand was weaker than expected 
however  clarcor saw a rebound in orders for sand control filters used in off shore oil drilling during the fourth quarter of the company expects this demand will continue throughout due to expected increases in drilling and exploration as a result of anticipated continuing demand and high prices for oil and gas 
the segment s operations in europe that sell primarily aviation and specialty filtration products  such as waste water filtration and rainwater runoff filtration  grew in and and additional growth is expected in sales levels in were lower for environmental filtration equipment and hvac filters used in industrial  commercial and residential applications 
lower hvac sales were due in part to lower filter usage in automotive and automotive parts manufacturing plants and in commercial and industrial applications and also due to competitive pricing pressures 
the segment continues to implement price increases to offset material cost increases 
the industrial environmental segment s sales increased  or million  in over the sales growth included approximately million due to acquisitions in and approximately million due to the additional fiscal week in the fourth quarter acquisition of martin kurz co  inc mki did not materially affect sales in fiscal sales of specialty filters sold to industrial markets used in aviation  defense and fluid power applications were higher in than in fiscal sales in on a same weeks basis were nearly even with sales of hvac filters for industrial and commercial markets and in automotive manufacturing facilities 
sales of hvac filters for the retail market increased in price increases improved the segment s sales by approximately one percentage point in changes in currency translation rates did not significantly impact sales growth in or the packaging segment s sales of million in grew from or approximately on a same weeks basis due to the introduction of a wide array of new packaging designs  primarily in partnership with major consumer product companies and price increases 
customer demand for fabricated metal packages  combination metal plastic packages and plastic packaging remained strong 
the segment s sales were million in  a increase from sales in increased approximately million due to the additional fiscal week in and approximately million due to price increases to customers  primarily to offset increased metal costs 
the remaining increase was due to increased customer demand for metal and plastic packaging mainly related to confectionery packaging and flat sheet metal decorating 

table of contents operating profit operating profit for increased to million from the level or approximately on a same weeks basis 
the additional week in added approximately million to operating profit 
operating margin improved to from in and in the improvement resulted primarily from higher engine mobile segment sales  various acquisitions which contributed million of incremental operating profit  a gain on an insurance recovery  elimination of a reserve related to an overseas subsidiary  cost reductions and improved capacity utilization 
these positive items were offset by stock option expense of million  charges of million arising from the refusal by eds to pay for products which it had ordered and used  and approximately million in costs associated with the restructuring of a european aviation cartridge filter manufacturing facility and the closing of an hvac manufacturing facility in north carolina 
the cost savings during related to restructurings were not significant 
the company expects the savings to approximate million annually beginning in fiscal related to the european restructuring 
the hvac restructuring plan is discussed more thoroughly below and in the outlook section 
operating profit of million in reflected increased sales levels over for each segment  including the acquisitions  and continued improvements in capacity utilization and production efficiencies 
the increase also includes approximately million related to the additional fiscal week in cost increases for raw materials and petroleum related expenses persisted throughout and were primarily offset by price increases to customers 
operating profit of million in fiscal included costs of million related to the company s headquarters relocation to tennessee 
foreign currency fluctuations did not have a material impact on consolidated operating profit in any year presented 
comparative operating profit information related to the company s business segments is as follows

change operating profit total engine mobile filtration industrial environmental filtration packaging relocation costs total operating margin as a percent of net sales engine mobile filtration industrial environmental filtration packaging total the engine mobile filtration segment reported operating profit of million in  an increase of from or approximately on a same weeks basis  primarily due to the sales volume increase  cost reduction efforts and related increased capacity utilization 
the additional week in contributed nearly million to operating profit 
although costs for purchased materials  including metal products  filter media and 
table of contents petroleum based products  and for freight have increased significantly over the past two years  price increases to customers have been implemented which have substantially offset the cost increases 
the segment s operating margin improved to from in and in operating margin improved in as a result of increased sales and capacity utilization  discretionary spending controls  and significant improvement in the operations of a manufacturing facility in the uk in  the uk manufacturing facility eliminated approximately million of costs primarily through productivity improvements and reduced spending 
operating profit in reflected the poor performance of this manufacturing facility in the uk the industrial environmental segment s operating profit decreased to million in or approximately million on a same weeks basis from million in and million in due to reduced sales of hvac filters  environmental filtration equipment and oil and gas filter products 
the productivity from these facilities was significantly less in due to lower than expected sales and production levels 
operating profit was also impacted by problems with installing a new computer system  maintaining proper levels of inventory  bad debt expense and the restructuring charges noted previously 
the segment s operating margin was in  in and in although margins were lower overall in than in  there was margin improvement during the latter half of as announced in july  the company began a restructuring program focused on the hvac filter manufacturing operations within its industrial environmental filtration segment 
the goal of the program is to achieve an overall segment operating margin from its current margins of mid single digits 
the company plans to spend million in capital and incur up to million in restructuring costs over a three year period in order to achieve its goal 
as part of this effort  the company closed its kenly  north carolina hvac manufacturing facility in november and recorded severance costs of million 
the company also signed a lease to open a new hvac facility in pittston  pennsylvania  which is expected to be in production by the end of the second quarter of this plant will be focused on serving customers in the northeast 
the industrial environmental filtration segment s operating profit of million in was an increase of over the profit of million 
in  the additional profit from the acquisitions and an increase in sales of aviation products more than offset reduced profit due to lower sales of oil and gas drilling filtration products 
operating profit related to hvac product sales improved slightly in the segment s operating results were impacted by continued costs to restructure and integrate manufacturing facilities  to integrate the hvac branch network and to implement a related business system conversion 
over the past several years  the segment has been actively integrating newly acquired businesses primarily acquired from through and making organizational changes that have reduced ongoing overhead and administrative costs 
the packaging segment s operating profit of million in increased from million in the increase was due to improved sales levels  and price increases to customers to offset cost increases during sales increases and an ongoing focus on improving manufacturing efficiency through closely monitoring productivity measures and implementing cost reduction initiatives contributed to an improvement in operating margin to in from in and in this segment s performance also reflects multi year investments in new product development initiatives  such as rapid prototype systems  digital plate making systems and high speed fabrication lines 
fiscal operating profit increased to million from million in primarily from pricing programs  increased sales of higher margin products and continued cost reduction programs 

table of contents other income expense net other income totaled million in compared to net other expense of in and net other income of million in the most significant change from relates to million in increased interest income due to higher interest rates and increased investment balances during interest expense did not vary substantially year over year as the amount of debt outstanding and its related interest rates have not significantly changed 
provision for income taxes the effective income tax rate for was as compared to in and in due to a greater increase in earnings from international operations compared to growth in the us  lower state tax charges  and the domestic manufacturing deduction 
the effective tax rate in is expected to be approximately to and reflects an expected continued increase in pretax income from lower tax rate locales  primarily in asia  and a decline in the extraterritorial income exclusion deduction 
also  since congress did not pass the research and experimentation tax credit extension until december  clarcor was not able to record this benefit during the last eleven months of fiscal the company will recognize a cumulative benefit from this credit covering the last eleven months of fiscal and the first quarter of in the first quarter of the estimated tax reduction to be recorded in fiscal related to the period will be approximately million 
the internal revenue service is currently auditing the company for fiscal years and  however  any outcome from the audit is unknown 
the provision for income taxes in resulted in an effective tax rate of compared to in a tax benefit of approximately million in the third quarter of resulted from the favorable settlement of a tax position related to a foreign subsidiary 
the provision included a million reduction of tax expense related to the reversal of a foreign tax credit valuation allowance due to the american jobs creation act of which extended the period for utilizing tax credits from five years to ten years 
these one time benefits reduced the effective rates in and by approximately one percentage point 
net earnings and earnings per share net earnings were million in  or per share on a diluted basis 
earnings per share was reduced by approximately per share related to the implementation of stock option expense accounting 
net earnings were million in  or diluted earnings per share of  compared to million in  or diluted earnings per share of in as described in note a to the consolidated financial statements  diluted earnings per share would have been and for and  respectively  had compensation expense for stock options been recorded in accordance with statement of financial accountings standards sfas no 
in  the impact of stock option expense is expected to be approximately per share 
the slight decrease of in diluted average shares outstanding for fiscal compared to was due to the repurchase of  shares in under the company s million share repurchase authorization offset by grants of stock based incentives 
the increase in diluted average shares outstanding in from was primarily due to stock based incentive activity partially offset by  shares that were repurchased in 
table of contents same weeks comparison although the comparison of fiscal year data on a same weeks basis is not a measure of financial performance under gaap  the company believes it is useful in understanding the impact of having an additional week in its fiscal year and fourth quarter 
removing the impact of the additional week in the prior year provides a comparable measure of the changes in net sales and operating profit year over year 
the additional week amount shown is an estimate based on the number of weeks and does not consider certain factors or allocations that may occur only on an annual basis 
the estimated amount is based on the average week for the actual year rather than the specific last week of the year 
management does not intend these items to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measures

table of contents financial condition liquidity and capital resources clarcor s financial position remains strong 
clarcor is essentially a debt free company with significant cash reserves as of year end cash and short term investments increased to million at year end from million at year end total assets increased to million at the end of fiscal compared to million at the beginning of the fiscal year 
the current ratio improved to at year end compared to at year end long term debt of million at year end relates primarily to industrial revenue bonds and is approximately the same as at year end shareholders equity increased to million from million at year end primarily as a result of net earnings and stock option activity offset by stock repurchases of million and dividend payments of million 
total debt was of total capitalization at year end compared to at year end in the consolidated statements of cash flows  cash generated from operating activities decreased million to million for primarily due to the net increase in purchases of short term investments of million  inventories of million and income taxes of million 
the increase in inventory was a normal seasonal increase 
in addition  due to the adoption of new accounting rules for stock based compensation effective at the beginning of  cash flow provided by operating activities was reduced by million due to tax benefits associated with tax deductions that exceeded the amount of compensation expense recognized in net earnings 
cash flow from operating activities was million in and million in the increase compared to the level resulted from increased net earnings and reduced investment in working capital 
these were ordinary working capital fluctuations due to business level activities and mainly resulted from the timing of payments made to vendors  the receipt of payments from customers  changes in inventory requirements and the timing of income tax payments 
in  the company made a voluntary contribution of million to its defined benefit pension trust for covered us employees 
a contribution was not made in either or under the current assumptions for pension plan asset returns  benefit payments and costs  and interest rates  annual contributions are not expected to be required for at least eight years for the qualified us defined benefit plan 
for  cash flows used in investing activities of million were lower than the million in and million in primarily due to lower spending on plant asset additions and business acquisitions 
the company made two acquisitions in for a total investment of million and two acquisitions in for a total investment of million 
the company spent million on acquisitions in additions to plant assets of million were primarily for new products  facility additions and improvements and cost reduction programs 
although a substantial amount of new equipment had been ordered late in  it was not delivered as quickly as expected 
therefore  capital spending was lower than anticipated 
the company expects capital expenditures to be much higher in due to the hvac restructuring program and potential expansion of manufacturing facilities in its engine mobile filtration segment to meet anticipated increases in product demand 
plant asset additions totaled million in and million in net cash used for financing activities totaled million in and million in net cash from financing activities totaled million in as a result of proceeds from a revolving credit agreement that were used primarily for a fourth quarter acquisition 
this amount was repaid in the company paid dividends of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the quarterly dividend rate was increased in september by 
the company expects to continue to make quarterly dividend payments to shareholders and to increase the dividend in future years 
in june  the company s board of directors authorized a million share repurchase program of clarcor common stock in the open market and through private transactions over a two year period 
in and  respectively  the company acquired  shares for million and  shares for million 
at year end  clarcor had  shares of common stock outstanding compared to  shares outstanding at the end of clarcor believes that its current operations will continue to generate cash and that sufficient lines of credit remain available to fund current operating needs  pay dividends  invest in development of new products and filter media  fund planned capital expenditures and expansion of current facilities  complete the hvac restructuring plans  and service and repay long term debt 
a million credit facility with a group of financial institutions will expire in april as of year end  there were no outstanding borrowings against the facility 
under a related 
table of contents million letter of credit subline  million had been issued for letters of credit for industrial revenue bonds 
the company s long term debt totaled million at year end and consists principally of industrial revenue bonds 
required principal payments on long term debt will be approximately million in based on scheduled payments in current debt agreements 
the company is in compliance with all covenants related to its borrowings  as described in note h to the consolidated financial statements 
as a part of the hvac restructuring strategy  over the next three years  clarcor plans to invest approximately million  primarily in new facilities and state of the art production equipment  and to spend million to restructure current facilities 
this is anticipated to result in an improvement in operating profit of million annually by the end of three years 
the goal is to have the company s hvac operations become the lowest delivered cost and most productive hvac filtration operation in the industry and for operating margins to reach 
specifically for  the company anticipates incurring approximately million in expenses  mainly in the second and third quarters  and realizing approximately million in cost reductions mainly in the third and fourth quarters 
therefore  the net benefit for is estimated to be million 
we believe the future annual benefit will be much larger as the restructuring costs are a one time item whereas the cost reductions are expected to recur every year going forward 
total capital equipment spending related to the restructuring program is estimated to be approximately million in in addition  the company expects to continue to use future additional cash flow for dividends  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
additional common stock repurchases may be made under the remaining authorized amount at year end of million after considering cash flow requirements for internal growth including working capital requirements  capital expenditures  acquisitions and the current stock price 
capital expenditures for normal facility maintenance and improvements  expansion of manufacturing and technical facilities  productivity improvements  the hvac restructuring program  new products and filter media development are expected to total to million in the company has no material long term purchase commitments 
it is committed to restructure its hvac operations as discussed in the previous paragraph although no significant purchase commitments were signed as of year end the company enters into purchase obligations with suppliers on a short term basis in the normal course of business 
the following table summarizes the company s current fixed cash obligations as of november  for the fiscal years indicated payments due by period less than more than total year years years years long term debt operating leases total off balance sheet arrangements the company s off balance sheet arrangements relate to various operating leases as discussed in note i to the consolidated financial statements 
the company had no significant derivative  swap  hedge  variable interest entity or special purpose entity agreements at fiscal year end or or any time during those years 
other matters quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s market risk is primarily related to the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations 
however  based on the low level of debt obligations as of year end  interest rate risk is not expected to be significant to the company in fiscal  and as a result  it is anticipated that a change in rates would not have a material impact on the company s net earnings or cash flows in fiscal the company s debt obligations are primarily at variable rates and are denominated in us dollars 
in order to minimize the long term costs of borrowing  the company manages its interest rate risk by monitoring trends in rates as a basis for determining whether to enter into fixed rate or variable rate agreements 

table of contents although the company continues to evaluate derivative financial instruments  including forwards  swaps and purchased options  to manage foreign currency exchange rate changes  the company did not hold derivatives during  or the effect of changes in foreign currency translation rates was not material to the company s financial condition and results of operations in fiscal the impact of future changes in foreign currency translation rates is difficult to estimate  however  if the us dollar strengthened or weakened relative to the currencies where the company s foreign income and cash flows are derived  there would not be a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
as a result of continued foreign sales and business activities  the company will continue to evaluate the use of derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate changes in the future 
critical accounting estimates the company s critical accounting policies  including the assumptions and judgments underlying them  are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies have been consistently applied in all material respects and address such matters as revenue recognition  depreciation methods  inventory valuation  asset impairment recognition  business combination accounting and pension and postretirement benefits 
these critical accounting policies may be affected by recent relevant accounting pronouncements discussed in the following section 
while the estimates and judgments associated with the application of these critical accounting policies may be affected by different assumptions or conditions  the company believes the estimates and judgments associated with the reported amounts are appropriate in the circumstances 
the following lists the most critical accounting estimates used in preparing the consolidated financial statements which require the company s management to use significant judgment and estimates of amounts that are inherently uncertain goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets the company periodically reviews goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
these reviews of fair value involve judgment and estimates of discount rates  transaction multiples and future cash flows for the reporting units that may be impacted by future sales and operating results for the reporting units  market conditions and worldwide economic conditions 
the company analyzed various discount rates  transaction multiples and cash flows for aggregated reporting units 
a sensitivity analysis was prepared which indicated that if these assumptions were individually changed by  there was no indication of impairment 
allowance for losses on accounts receivable allowances for losses on customer accounts receivable balances are estimated based on economic conditions in the industries to which the company sells and on historical experience by evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss  fluctuations in amounts owed and current payment trends 
the company s concentration of risk is also monitored and at year end  the largest outstanding customer account balance was million and the five largest account balances totaled million 
the allowances provided are estimates that may be impacted by economic and market conditions which could have an effect on future allowance requirements and results of operations 
pensions the company s pension obligations are determined using estimates including those related to discount rates  asset values and changes in compensation 
the discount rate used for the qualified plan for us employees was determined based on the citigroup pension discount curve for cash flows at the plan s estimated liability duration of years 
this rate was selected as the best estimate of the rate at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled on the measurement date taking into account the nature and duration of the benefit obligations of the plan using high quality fixed income investments currently available rated aa or better and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the benefits 
the expected return on plan assets was determined based on historical long term investment returns as well as future expectations given target investment asset allocations and current economic conditions 
the rate of compensation increase represents the long term assumption for expected increases in salaries among continuing active participants accruing benefits 
the assumptions are similarly determined for each pension obligation 
actual results and future obligations will vary based on changes in interest rates  stock and bond market valuations and employee compensation 
in  a reduction in the expected return on plan assets of would result in additional expense in fiscal of approximately 
table of contents million  while a reduction in the discount rate of would result in additional expense of approximately million for the company s qualified defined benefit pension plan for us covered employees 
interest rates and pension plan valuations may vary significantly based on worldwide economic conditions and asset investment decisions 
the unrecognized net actuarial loss of million at year end is due primarily to prior changes in assumptions related to discount rates and expected asset returns and this actuarial loss will be recognized as pension expense in the future over the average remaining service period of the employees in the plans in accordance with sfas no 
income taxes the company is required to estimate and record income taxes payable for each of the us and international jurisdictions in which the company operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing accounting treatment between tax and book which result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in addition  accruals are also estimated for federal  state and international tax matters for which deductibility is subject to interpretation 
taxes payable and the related deferred tax differences may be impacted by changes to tax laws  changes in tax rates and changes in taxable profits and losses 
recent relevant accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r 
this statement requires recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit postretirement plans as an asset or liability in the statement of financial position and to recognize changes in the funded status in comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur 
sfas no 
also requires measurement of the funded status of a plan as of the date of the statement of financial position 
sfas no 
is effective for recognition of the funded status of the benefit plans for the company s fiscal year and is effective for the measurement date provisions for fiscal year the company is currently evaluating the effect of sfas no 
on its consolidated financial statements 
however  based on the company s funded status as of november   the adoption of sfas no 
is expected to decrease total shareholders equity by approximately  or  net of deferred taxes 
the ultimate amounts recorded are dependent on a number of factors  including the discount rate in effect at the next measurement date  the actual rate of return on pension assets for and the tax effects of the adjustment upon adoption 
changes in those factors as well as any funding in could increase or decrease the expected impact of implementing sfas no 
on the company s consolidated financial statements at november  in september  the fasb also issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
adoption of this statement  which will be effective for the company s fiscal year  is not anticipated to have a material impact on the company s financial statements  although additional disclosures may be required 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
the interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and will be effective for the company s fiscal year fin prescribes guidance for recognizing  measuring  reporting and disclosing a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the company is currently evaluating the effects fin will have on its financial statements 
outlook the company expects that sales and diluted earnings per share will continue to grow in  which would result in the th consecutive year of both sales and earnings per share growth 
diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of to in in future years  continued emphasis on cost reductions and price increases to customers within each business unit are expected to offset anticipated increased costs for energy and purchased materials  primarily metal and petroleum based products  freight  energy and employee benefits 

table of contents these costs for the company may change significantly based on future changes in the us and world economies 
the company fully anticipates that sales and profits will improve as a result of sales initiatives  manufacturing productivity programs and cost reductions 
if unfavorable economic conditions occur  the company expects to implement cost reduction programs in response 
clarcor s international growth is expected to continue at a rate higher than the company s domestic growth rate and significant currency movements could have an impact on sales and operating profit 
generally  a weaker us dollar will contribute to higher sales and profits 
during december  the company s chinese operation relocated to a larger manufacturing  warehouse and technical center complex to accommodate expected sales growth for the company s products in china and asia 
clarcor anticipates that the development of its nanofiber technology will provide additional opportunities for its filter product lines 
the company expects delivery of a nanofiber manufacturing line in february and anticipates having that line in production later in the year 
continued sales growth and increased operating profits are expected for the engine mobile filtration segment as product demand for aftermarket heavy duty filtration products remains strong due in part to high levels of freight transport and railway usage to move goods worldwide 
growth is also expected due to new product introductions and from sales and marketing initiatives  including growth in sales to oem dealers and increased sales of off road filter applications for construction  mining and agricultural equipment 
the company does not expect the emissions regulations for heavy duty trucks to have a material impact on sales 
during  the company began implementing a restructuring program in its industrial environmental segment primarily to rationalize and relocate certain hvac manufacturing plants to improve operating efficiencies and reduce manufacturing costs 
the program will include eliminating certain unprofitable product lines and discontinuing sales of products to certain customers where the margins are unacceptable 
the company also expects to realize significant cost savings and efficiency benefits beginning in and continuing over the next several years which the company expects will be substantially greater than the costs incurred to complete the restructuring program 
sales growth for the industrial environmental segment is also expected primarily due to continued growth in sales of specialty process liquid filters 
the company expects to begin manufacturing dust collector cartridges and filters used in oil drilling and fiber resin manufacturing in its new plant in china 
the company also remains optimistic that there will be a continued increase in demand for filtration systems sold into the capital goods markets 
although demand was weak earlier in for filters sold into the oil and gas market  an upturn in sales of these products in late is expected to continue in fiscal as a result of anticipated increases in drilling and exploration due to continuing demand and high prices for oil and gas 
the packaging segment s sales and profits are expected to grow more slowly in as customers continue to shift from metal packaging to plastic or plastic metal combination packaging 
the company expects to continue to make capital investments to improve productivity  increase manufacturing and distribution capacity  develop new filter media and new products and implement new enterprise planning systems 
the company continues to assess acquisition opportunities  primarily in related filtration businesses 
it is expected that these acquisitions  if completed  would expand the company s market base  distribution coverage or product offerings 
however  prices of filtration company acquisitions have significantly increased in recent years and that may impact the company s successful completion of acquisitions 
the company has established financial standards that will continue to be vigorously applied in the review of all acquisition opportunities 
clarcor believes that it has sufficient cash flow and borrowing capacity to continue its acquisition program
