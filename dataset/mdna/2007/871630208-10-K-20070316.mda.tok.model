item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we began business as gtg  inc on november  on april   gtg  inc changed its name to syntroleum corporation 
on august   syntroleum corporation merged into slh corporation 
slh corporation was the surviving entity in the merger and was renamed syntroleum corporation 
syntroleum corporation was later re incorporated in delaware on june  through its merger into a delaware corporation that was organized on april  we are incurring substantial operating and research and development costs with respect to developing and commercializing the syntroleum process and the synfining process and do not anticipate recognizing any significant revenues from production from either a gtl or ctl fuel or specialty plant or from licensing our technology in the near future 
as a result  we expect to continue to operate at a loss until sufficient revenues are recognized from licensing activities or commercial operations of gtl and ctl plants 
generally  any reference to gtl is also applicable to ctl unless the context indicates otherwise 
operating revenues during the periods discussed below  our revenues were primarily generated from reimbursement for research and development activities associated with the syntroleum process and catalyst sales 
in the future  we expect to receive revenue from sales of products or fees for the use of gtl and ctl plants in which we will own an equity interest  demonstration plant product sales  licensing  catalyst sales  and research and development activities carried out with industry participants 
until the commencement of commercial operation of gtl or ctl plants in which we own an interest  we expect that cash flow relating to the syntroleum process will consist primarily of revenues associated with joint development activities 
we will not receive any cash flow from gtl or ctl plants in which we own an equity interest until the first of these plants is constructed and will not receive additional license fees until we enter into additional license agreements or existing licensees develop commercial plants 
our future operating revenues will depend on the successful commercial construction and operation of gtl or ctl plants based on the syntroleum process  the success of competing gtl technologies  the success of our non gtl projects  and other competing uses for natural gas or coal 
we expect our results of operations and cash flows to be affected by changing crude oil  natural gas  fuel and specialty product prices and trends in environmental regulations 
if the price of these products increases decreases  there could be a corresponding increase decrease in operating revenues 
additionally during we began exploring the applicability of our technologies to renewable energy 
we have conducted testing that resulted in the production of research quantities of renewable fuels from a variety of liquid vegetable and animal fat feedstocks 
we continue to evaluate this technology and possible future business opportunities 
gtl ctl plant revenues 
we intend to develop gtl or ctl plants and to retain equity interests in these plants 
these plants will enable us to gain experience with the commercial operation of the syntroleum process and  if successful  are expected to provide ongoing revenues 
some of the anticipated products of these plants ie  synthetic crude oil  fischer tropsch waxes  synthetic diesel iso paraffinic kerosene and other fuels  naphtha  lube base oils  process oils  and or liquid normal paraffins have historically been sold at premium prices and may result in relatively high sales margins 
we anticipate forming joint ventures with energy industry and financial participants in order to finance and operate these plants 
we anticipate that our gtl or ctl plants will include co venturers who have low cost gas or coal reserves in strategic locations and or have distribution networks in place for the synthetic products to be made in each plant as well as engineering  procurement and construction contractors and floating  production  storage and offloading vessel fpso operators 
license revenues 
we expect to generate revenue earned from licensing the syntroleum process through four types of contracts master license agreements  volume license agreements  regional license agreements and site license agreements 
master  volume and regional license agreements provide the licensee with the right to enter into site license agreements for individual gtl or ctl plants 
a master license agreement grants broad geographic and volume rights  while volume license agreements limit the total production capacity of all gtl plants constructed under the agreement to specified amounts  and regional license agreements limit the geographical rights of the licensee 
master  volume and regional license agreements signed in the past have required an up front cash deposit 
table of contents that may offset or partially offset license fees for future plants payable under site licenses 
in the past  we have acquired technologies or commitments of funds for joint development activities  services or other consideration in lieu of the initial cash deposit in cases where we believed the technologies or commitments had a greater value 
our site license agreements currently require fees to be paid in increments when milestones during the plant design and construction process are achieved 
the amount of the license fee under our existing master and volume license agreements is currently determined pursuant to a formula based on the present value of the product of the yearly maximum design capacity of the plant  an assumed life of the plant and an agreed royalty rate 
our licensee fees may change from time to time based on the size of the plant  improvements that reduce plant capital cost and competitive market conditions 
our existing master and volume license agreements allow for the adjustment of fees for new site licenses under certain circumstances 
our accounting policy is to defer all up front deposits under master  volume and regional license agreements and license fees under site license agreements and recognize percent of the deposits and fees as revenue in the period in which the engineering process design package pdp for a plant licensed under the agreement is delivered and recognize the other percent of the deposits and fees when the plant has passed applicable performance tests 
the amount of license revenue we earn will be dependent on the construction of plants by licensees  as well as the number of licenses we sell in the future 
to date we have received million in cash as initial deposits and option fees under our existing license agreements 
except for million recorded as revenue in connection with option expirations  million of license credits returned by the commonwealth of australia as part of the settlement for the sweetwater project and million recorded as revenue as a result of the release of license credits and indemnifications  these amounts have been recorded in deferred revenue 
our obligations under these license agreements are to allow the use of the technology  provide access to engineering services to generate a pdp at an additional cost  and to refund percent of the advances should the licensee build a plant that does not pass all process performance testing 
these licenses generally begin to expire in and the initial deposits will be recognized as licensing revenue as the licenses expire should a licensee not purchase a site license and begin construction of a plant prior to expiration of the license 
catalyst revenues 
we expect to earn revenue from the sale of our proprietary catalysts to some of our licensees 
our license agreements currently require our catalyst to be used in the initial loading of the catalyst into the fischer tropsch reactor for the licensee to receive a process guarantee 
after the initial fill  the licensee may use other catalyst vendors if appropriate catalysts are available 
the price for catalysts purchased from us pursuant to license agreements is equal to our cost plus a specified margin 
we will receive revenue from catalyst sales if and when our licensees purchase catalysts 
we expect that catalysts will need to be replaced every three to five years 
joint development revenues 
we continually conduct research and development activities in order to improve the conversion efficiency and reduce the capital and operating costs of gtl and ctl plants based on the syntroleum process 
we receive joint development revenues primarily through two initiatives prospect assessment and feasibility studies and formal joint development arrangements with our licensees and others 
through these joint development arrangements  we may receive revenue as reimbursement for specified portions of our research and development or engineering expenses 
under some of these agreements  the joint development participant may receive credits against future license fees for monies expended on joint research and development 
during the periods presented  joint development revenues consisted primarily of amounts received from marathon  the doe  dod  sasol  and ivanhoe 
these projects require us to deliver results from development activities such as non proprietary analysis of plant processes  flow diagrams  chemical analysis and fuel production plans that will be jointly shared by each party 
the customers benefit from paying for these development activities as they are obtaining access to information pertaining to the syntroleum process 
revenue is recognized when final delivery of the shared technology has occurred 
under some of these agreements  the joint development participant may receive credits against future license fees for monies expended on joint development 
the value of these credits is a fixed amount stated in the contract and reflected as deferred revenue until the credit is utilized 
the revenues recognized in the future from these contracts are deemed to be fixed and determinable under the criteria specified in staff accounting bulletin  topic and sop  software revenue recognition 
to date  our revenues and costs have been related to certain projects and are wholly dependent upon the nature of our projects 
the various sizes and timing of these projects  including the demonstration plant the catoosa demonstration facility used as part of the doe ultra clean fuels production and demonstration project with marathon affect the comparability of the periods presented 

table of contents demonstration plant product sales revenues 
we expect to provide synthetic ultra clean diesel fuel  such as our s diesel fuel and s iso parafinnic kerosene jet fuel subject to certification  and fc naphtha fuels to various customers for their use in further research and testing upon their request 
our ultra clean s diesel fuel and s iso paraffinic kerosene jet fuel subject to certification is a paraffinic  high cetane distillate fuel that is essentially free of sulfur  olefins  metals  aromatics and alcohols 
the fuels have been produced at our catoosa demonstration facility 
revenues are recognized upon delivery of the requested fuels 
operating expenses our operating expenses historically have consisted primarily of the construction and operation of the catoosa demonstration facility  pilot plant  engineering  including third party engineering  research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses  which include costs associated with general corporate overhead  compensation expense  legal and accounting expenses and expenses associated with other related administrative functions 
our policy is to expense costs associated with the catoosa demonstration facility and pilot plant  engineering and research and development costs as incurred in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs 
all of these research and development expenses are associated with our development of the syntroleum process 
the catoosa demonstration facility expenses include costs to construct  maintain  and operate the facility for further research and development as well as for demonstrations for licensees and other customers 
research and development expenses include costs to operate both our laboratory and technology center  salaries and wages associated with these operations  research and development services performed by universities  consultants and third parties and additional supplies and equipment for these facilities 
our policy is to expense costs associated with the development of gtl plants or other projects until we begin our front end engineering and design program on the respective projects 
we also capitalize any costs associated with a project that would have economic value for future projects 
we have incurred costs related specifically to the development of the syntroleum process including our gtl mobile facility project 
these costs  which relate primarily to outside contract services for initial engineering  design  and development are included in pilot plant  engineering and research and development costs in our consolidated statements of operations 
we commenced operations at the catoosa demonstration facility in the first quarter of  with production of the initial finished fuels occurring on march  we have produced all of our contractual commitments to the doe and have delivered all of the required fuels to a fuels testing facility in detroit  michigan  denali national park in alaska  the university of alaska in fairbanks and the washington dc area metropolitan transit authority 
in september  the company completed the production of our contract committed volume of fuels to the united states department of defense 
in addition  we also successfully completed the longest run of our catalyst testing activity at the tulsa pilot plant 
in line with the program completion of our demonstration plans  we suspended operations at both facilities 
we have also recognized depreciation  depletion and amortization expense related to office and computer equipment  buildings and leasehold improvements and patents 
we have incurred significant costs and expenses over the last several years as we have expanded our research and development  engineering and commercial activities  including staffing levels 
in the third quarter of with the completion of our research and development efforts related to running the cdf and pilot plant  operating costs declined as a result of suspending operations at both plants  reducing our workforce and focusing on cost minimization 
this workforce reduction amounted to employees 
we anticipate these cost saving measures implemented in the third quarter of to have a significant favorable impact on operating expenses on a go forward basis 
we do not expect to rehire any of the employees included in the reductions if we accelerate the development of a commercial project 
we paid in full a significant portion of the severance payments related to our staff reduction by the end of we plan to continue to monitor our expenditures with regards to general and administrative expense throughout as well 
our operating expenses could increase further if we accelerate our development of commercial projects 
if we are successful in developing a gtl or ctl plant in which we own an interest  we expect to incur significant expenses in connection with our share of the engineering design  construction and start up of the plant 
upon the commencement of commercial operations of a plant  we will incur our share of cost of sales expenses relating primarily to the cost of natural gas or coal feedstocks for the plant and operating expenses relating to the 
table of contents plant  including labor  consumables and product marketing costs 
due to the substantial capital expenditures associated with the construction of gtl or ctl plants  we expect to incur significant depreciation and amortization expense in the future 
discontinued operations international oil and gas our international oil and gas activities have primarily included the leasehold acquisition  geological and geophysical work covering various areas in nigeria  and drilling costs for the aje discovery well aje in oil mining lease oml offshore nigeria 
in fourth quarter  we decided to exit our international oil and gas activities as part of our strategy of focusing our efforts on specific goals and projects that have gtl and ctl potential

mobile gtl facility 
in august  we announced our plan to commercialize a gtl barge 
the gtl barge is designed to develop offshore and near shore coastal natural gas fields in the one to three trillion cubic feet tcf range where there is currently no infrastructure to produce and transport the natural gas 
these fields are generally considered to be too small to support a liquefied natural gas facility 
the gtl barge builds on the strengths and advantages of the syntroleum process  which utilizes air instead of oxygen 
the gtl barge is also designed to have equipment to process natural gas liquids 
in february  we executed an agreement with bluewater energy services bv bluewater to conduct a feasibility study and engineering study for placing a small gtl plant on an fpso 
in february  we executed a letter of intent with bluewater to memorialize the intentions of the formation of a joint venture to develop  construct  own and operate a fpso vessel equipped with gas to liquids conversion capability

the doe awarded a contract in to integrated concepts and research corporation to provide funding for the doe ultra clean transportation fuels project for which we provided the ultra clean fuels doe catoosa project 
in may  we signed a participation agreement with marathon in connection with this project that included the relocation of certain modules from our cherry point gtl facility at arco s refinery in washington state to the tulsa port of catoosa near tulsa  oklahoma 
these modules formed the basis of our catoosa demonstration facility  a demonstration facility designed to produce up to approximately 
table of contents b d of synthetic products and demonstrate commercial scale up of the syntroleum and synfining processes 
the facility was mechanically completed and dedicated on october   and we achieved startup and commenced fuel deliveries in the first quarter of the fuels from this facility have been tested by others in advanced power train and emission control technologies  and the fuels were also tested in bus fleets by the washington metropolitan area transit authority and the us national park service at denali national park in alaska 
outside the scope of the doe catoosa project and at our own cost  we installed additional facilities at the catoosa demonstration facility for the purpose of further demonstrating our technology and operational capabilities 
since this project is not for commercial operations  the costs associated with it have been expensed in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs 
the project has been funded by us and the other project participants  including million from the doe for the relocation  engineering  and re installation of the cherry point equipment  labor and cash contributions of million by marathon  and million from us provided by a loan agreement between marathon and us 
we completed our fuel production and delivery commitments in connection with the doe catoosa project during and as a result  we recognized  in joint development revenues for the year ended december  dod projects 
in january  congress appropriated million for a proposed flexible jp single battlefield fuel pilot plant program under the department of defense appropriation bill  in september  we signed a million contract with the dod to participate in the program  to provide for the design of a small footprint plant for fuels production for land based and marine applications  as well as testing of synthetically made gtl jp fuel in military diesel and turbine engine applications 
phase i of this program is now complete  and all the work done to date has validated our beliefs in the performance of the single battlefield fuel product 
congress appropriated million for phase ii development of our proposed flexible jp single battlefield fuel pilot plant program under fiscal year dod appropriations legislation 
we received approximately  under the appropriation 
phase ii included expanded engineering and design work for fuel production systems and further single battlefield fuel characterization and demonstration work 
finalization of our contracts occurred in the fourth quarter of and we began work at that time

the project was completed in september  in august  congress appropriated million for phase iii development of our flexible jp single battlefield fuel pilot plant program under the dod fiscal appropriations legislation 
we received approximately million under the appropriation 
phase iii of this program includes expanded engineering and design work for single battlefield fuel production systems for a marine environment and further single battlefield fuel characterization and demonstration work for all branches of the military 
finalization of the contracts for this phase occurred in the second quarter of we recognized joint development revenue from this project of  and  for the years ended december  and respectively 
we expect to complete the contract in in june  we signed a contract to deliver an initial  gallons of aviation grade ft research fluid s to the dod for evaluation and flight testing 
this marked the commencement of the dod s larger program aimed at long term in flight evaluation of ft aviation fuel  and their examination of the prospects for the domestic manufacture and supply of synthetic aviation fuels from ft plants 
we completed production and shipment of approximately  gallons of our ft aviation fuel commitment in early september on september   our ultra clean iso paraffinic kerosene jet fuel was successfully tested in a united states air force b stratofortress bomber aircraft 
the plane lifted off from edwards air force base with a blend of our ft jet fuel and traditional jp jet fuel which was burned in two of the eight engines on the plane 
this marks the first time that ft jet fuel has been tested in a military flight demo  and is the first of several planned test flights 
a second successful flight test was performed on december  at edwards air force base in california 
this test used a blend of our jet fuel and conventional jp in all eight engines 
this marks the first time that a b has flown using a synfuel blend as the only fuel on board 
we recognized approximately  in revenue from the sale of jet fuel and labor associated with this contract 
the government announced plans to seek up to an additional million gallons of alternative synthetic aviation fuel in and we anticipate submitting one or more proposals to aid in this effort 

table of contents following delivery of our s jet fuel to the dod for the flight test in september  we had completed the production requirements of our contract committed volumes of fuels to the united states departments of defense  energy and transportation 
fuel deliveries to the dot from prior production are ongoing

liquidity and capital resources general as of december   we had  in cash and short term investments 
our current liabilities from continuing operations totaled  as of december  at december   we had  in accounts receivable outstanding relating to our gtl fuel sales and joint development activities 
we believe that all of the receivables currently outstanding will be collected and therefore we have not established a reserve for bad debts 
cash flows used in operations were  during the year ended december   compared to  during the year ended december  the decrease primarily results from lower cash used in discontinued operations in when compared to and lower costs related to the cdf 
this was partially offset by increased research  development  and engineering costs in when compared to cash flows used in investing activities were  during the year ended december   compared to cash flows used in investing activities of  during the year ended december  the decrease in cash used in investing activities is primarily related to the receipt in of  for a note receivable previously held  receipt of a non refundable deposit of  from aeerl and lower capital expenditures for international oil and gas assets which have been included in cash used in discontinued operations 
cash flows provided by financing activities were  during the year ended december   compared to  provided by financing activities during the year ended december  the decrease in cash flows provided by financing activities relates to the proceeds received from the sale of stock and option exercises totaling  during the year ended december  compared to  during the same period in we have expended and will continue to expend a substantial amount of funds to continue the research and development of the syntroleum process  to market the syntroleum process  to design and construct gtl and ctl plants  and to develop our other commercial projects 
we intend to obtain additional funds through collaborative or other arrangements with strategic partners and others and through debt including debt which is convertible into our common or preferred stock and equity financing 
we also intend to obtain additional funding through joint ventures  license agreements and other strategic alliances  as well as various other financing arrangements to meet our capital and operating cost needs for various projects 
we had an effective registration statement at december  for the proposed offering from time to time of shares of our common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  depository shares or warrants for an aggregate offering price of approximately million 
as discussed below  we had an equity transaction subsequent to december  which reduced the amount available in our effective registration statement to million 
if we obtain additional funds by issuing equity securities  dilution to stockholders may occur 
in addition  preferred stock could be issued in the future without stockholder approval  and the terms of our preferred stock could include dividend  liquidation  conversion  voting and other rights that are more favorable than the rights of the holders of our common stock 
we can give no assurance that any of the transactions outlined above will be available to us when needed or on terms acceptable or favorable to us 
on january   we sold all of the stock of the subsidiaries that held our interests in the ajapa and aje fields to aeerl 
as previously discussed  aeerl is obligated to pay us  on the earlier to occur of april   or the date aeerl raises additional capital 

table of contents we are currently exploring alternatives for raising capital to commercialize the growth of our gtl and ctl businesses  including the formation of joint ventures and other strategic alliances 
if adequate funds are not available  or if we are not successful in establishing a strategic alliance  we may be required to reduce  delay or eliminate expenditures for our gtl and ctl plant development and other activities  as well as our research and development and other activities  or may seek to enter into a business combination transaction with or sell assets to another company 
we could also be forced to license to third parties the rights to commercialize additional products or technologies that we would otherwise seek to develop ourselves 
the transactions we outlined above may not be available to us when needed or on terms acceptable or favorable to us 
assuming the commercial success of the plants based on the syntroleum process  we expect that license fees  catalyst sales and sales of products from gtl or ctl plants in which we own an interest will be a source of revenues 
in addition  we could receive revenues from other commercial projects we are pursuing 
however  we may not receive any of these revenues  and these revenues may not be sufficient for capital expenditures or operations and may not be received within the expected time frame 
if we are unable to generate funds from operations  our need to obtain funds through financing activities will be increased 
we have sought and intend to continue to temporarily invest our assets  pending their use  so as to avoid becoming subject to the registration requirements of the investment company act of these investments are likely to result in lower yields on the funds invested than might be available in the securities market generally 
if we were required to register as an investment company under the investment company act  we would become subject to substantial regulation that could materially and adversely affect us

this statement provides guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
based on this guidance  the sec staff believes that registrants should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and an income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and use assumptions that affect reported amounts 
we believe that the following items represent our critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues from joint development activities when contract deliverables are completed 
proceeds received prior to the completion of contractual obligations are deferred with revenues recognized upon completion of our obligations specified under the contract 
substantially all of our joint development revenues during the periods presented have been from joint development activities with several major oil companies see note  the doe and the dod 
all such joint development activities were pursuant to joint research and development agreements where we expense our research and development costs as incurred 
these projects require us to deliver results from development activities such as non proprietary analysis of plant processes  flow diagrams  chemical analysis and fuel production plans that will be jointly shared by each party 
the customers benefit from paying for these development activities as they are obtaining access to information pertaining to the syntroleum process 
revenue is recognized when final delivery of the shared technology has occurred 
under some of these agreements  the joint development participant may receive credits against future license fees for monies expended on joint research and development 
the value of these credits is a fixed amount stated in the contract and reflected as deferred revenue until the credit is utilized 
the revenues to be recognized in the future from these contracts are deemed to be fixed and determinable under the criteria specified in staff accounting bulletin  topic and sop software revenue recognition 
license fee deposits received as cash upon the sale of master volume or regional license agreements are recorded as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets until recognized as revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
we recognize revenue on the sale of license agreements by recording percent of the license fee deposit as revenue when a site license agreement has been formally executed  the license fee deposit has been paid in cash and we have delivered to the licensee the process design package for the licensee s initial licensed plant 
since percent of the license fee deposit is subject to the our indemnity obligation with respect to the performance guarantee on the related plant  the remaining license fee deposit will be recognized as revenue in the consolidated statements of operations after the related plant has passed certain performance tests
