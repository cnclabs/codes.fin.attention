each member of the lending group may elect to participate or not participate in any request we make to increase the maximum borrowing commitment 
in addition  any increase in the borrowing commitment pursuant to this accordion feature is subject to certain terms and conditions  including the absence of an event of default 
the increased borrowing commitment may be used for general corporate purposes 
we are permitted and intend to request an increase in the borrowing limit under the accordion feature of this credit facility effective upon the completion of our acquisition of talx

our variable rate debt consists of the previously mentioned revolving credit facilities and generally bears interest based on a specified margin plus a base rate  libor or commercial paper rate 
the interest rates reset periodically  depending on the terms of the respective financing arrangements 
at december   interest rates on substantially all of our variable rate debt ranged from to 
we were in compliance with all of our financial and non financial debt covenants at december  we do not anticipate any covenant compliance issues if our acquisition of talx is consummated as presently structured 
on february   standard poor s corporation downgraded our senior unsecured long term fixed debt rating from a to bbb in reaction to our public announcement of the agreement to acquire talx corporation and an additional million share repurchase program  due to its belief that the acquisition reflects a somewhat more aggressive financial policy and more leveraged financial profile 
s p s rating outlook remained stable 
on february   moody s investors service changed our rating outlook to stable from positive but maintained its baa rating on our senior unsecured long term fixed debt

at december   the amount available for future share repurchases under this program was million 
in february  our board of directors amended the plan to authorize an additional repurchase of million of our common stock  million of such repurchase authorization is contingent on the closing of our previously described pending acquisition of talx as discussed above  following the completion of the talx acquisition  we intend to repurchase approximately million in equifax stock in open market transactions or in privately negotiated purchases 
the timing and nature of any such repurchases will depend on market conditions  other investment opportunities  applicable securities laws and other factors

contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december  the table excludes commitments that are contingent based on events or factors uncertain at this time 
some of the excluded commitments are discussed below the footnotes to the table 
payments due by total less than year to years to years thereafter in millions debt operating leases data processing  outsourcing agreements and other purchase obligations other long term liabilities interest payments the amounts are gross of unamortized discounts totaling million at december  total debt on our consolidated balance sheets is net of the unamortized discounts 
for additional information about our debt  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
our operating lease obligations principally involve office space and equipment  which includes the lease of our technology center that expires in  the lease associated with our headquarters building that expires in and the ground lease associated with our headquarters building that expires in for additional information about our operating leases  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
these agreements primarily represent our minimum contractual obligations for services that we outsource associated with our computer data processing operations and related functions  and certain administrative functions 
these agreements expire between and for additional information about these agreements  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
these long term liabilities primarily relate to obligations associated with certain pension  postretirement and other compensation related plans  some of which are discounted in accordance with gaap 
we made certain assumptions about the timing of such future payments 
this table does not include our severance accrual related to our organizational realignment 
for additional information about this accrual  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
for future interest payments on related variable rate debt  which is generally based on libor or commercial paper plus a specified margin  we used the variable rate in effect at december  to calculate these payments 
the variable portion of the rate at december  excluding the margin and facility fees was between and for substantially all of our variable debt 
future interest payments related to our million revolving credit facility and trade receivables backed revolving credit facility are based on the borrowings outstanding at december  through their respective maturity dates  assuming such borrowings are outstanding until that time 
future interest payments may be different depending on the borrowing activity going forward under these revolving credit facilities 
a potential significant use of cash would be the payment to computer sciences corporation csc if they were to exercise their option to sell their credit reporting business to us at any time prior to the option exercise price will be determined by agreement or by an appraisal process and would be due in cash within days after the exercise of the option 
we estimate that if the option had been exercised at december   the price range would have approximated million to million 
this estimate is based solely on our internal analysis of the value of the business  current market conditions and other factors  all of which are subject to constant change 
therefore  the actual option exercise price could be materially higher or lower than our estimate 
our agreement with csc  which expires on july   also provides us with an option to purchase its credit reporting business if it does not elect to renew the agreement or if there is a change in control of csc while the agreement is in effect 
if csc were to exercise its option  or if we were able to and decided to exercise our option  then we would have to obtain additional sources of funding 
we believe that this funding would be available from sources such as additional bank lines of credit and the capital markets for debt and or equity financing 
however  the availability and terms of any such capital financing would be subject to a number of factors  including credit market conditions  the state of the equity markets  general economic conditions  credit ratings and our financial performance and condition 
in the preceding table  we have not included amounts related to future pension and other postretirement benefit plan contributions  as such required funding amounts have not been determined 
for additional information about our pension and other benefit plans  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
off balance sheet transactions other than facility leasing arrangements  we do not engage in off balance sheet financing activities 
in  we entered into a synthetic lease on our atlanta corporate headquarters building in order to obtain favorable financing terms with regard to this facility 
this million lease expires in lease payments for the remaining term totaled million at december  under this synthetic lease arrangement  we have guaranteed the residual value of the leased property to the lessor 
in the event that the property were to be sold by the lessor at the end of the lease term  we would be responsible for any shortfall of the sales proceeds  up to a maximum amount of million  which equals of the value of the property at the beginning of the lease term 
the liability for this shortfall  which was million and million at december  and  respectively  is recorded in other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
letters of credit and guarantees we will from time to time issue standby letters of credit  performance bonds or other guarantees in the normal course of business 
the aggregate notional amount of all performance bonds and standby letters of credit was not material at december   and all have a maturity of one year or less 
guarantees are issued from time to time to support the needs of the operating units 
in connection with the sale of our risk management collections business to rma holdings  llc in october  we guaranteed the operating lease payments of a partnership affiliated with rma to a lender of the partnership pursuant to a term loan 
the operating lease  which expires december   has a remaining balance of million  based on the undiscounted value of remaining lease payments  including real estate taxes  at december  in september  rma sold substantially all of its assets to nco group  inc nco  after obtaining approval from the us bankruptcy court for the northern district of ohio  eastern division 
in conjunction with this sale  nco agreed to assume the operating lease obligations discussed above  which we will continue to guarantee 
we believe that the likelihood of demand for payment by us is minimal and expect no material losses to occur related to this guarantee 
accordingly  we do not have a liability on our consolidated balance sheets at december  or related to this guarantee 
for additional information regarding this transaction see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form k 
other contingencies there are other matters which we are involved in  such as legal proceedings  claims and litigation  for which the final outcome and impact to our consolidated financial statements is uncertain at december  for additional information about these matters  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
pension plans pension benefits are provided through us and canadian defined benefit pension plans and two supplemental executive defined benefit pension plans 
substantially all employees participate in one or more of these plans 
the measurement date for our defined benefit pension plans is december st of each year 
prior to january   we had one non contributory qualified retirement plan covering most us salaried employees the us retirement income plan  or usrip and a defined benefit plan for most salaried employees in canada the canadian retirement income plan  or crip 
benefits of both plans are primarily a function of salary and years of service 
on january   we separated the usrip into two defined benefit plans subject to the employee retirement income security act erisa 
the new plan  the equifax inc pension plan eipp  was funded in january with the transfer of million of assets from the usrip and a company contribution of million 
in november  an additional million of plan assets were transferred from the usrip to the eipp 
the eipp covers all active employee participants of equifax as of january   and the usrip covers all inactive retired and vested participants as of that date 
inactive participants constituted approximately of total participants prior to the separation 
the benefits of participants in both plans were unaffected by the separation 
the two groups of participants active and inactive had projected patterns of actuarial liabilities which were markedly different  due to the demographic differences between the two populations 
the two plans have separate assumed rates of return and separate asset allocation strategies  which will allow us to more efficiently fund our pension liabilities 
additionally  the assets of one plan will not be available to fund the liabilities of the other plan 
the crip was not impacted by the separation of the usrip 
at december   the usrip and the eipp met or exceeded erisa s minimum funding requirements 
we do not expect to have to make any minimum funding contributions under erisa for with respect to the usrip or the eipp  based on applicable law as currently in effect 
in january and  however  we made discretionary contributions of million and million  respectively  to the eipp 
we also made a million discretionary contribution in to fund our other post retirement benefit plans 
in the future  we will make minimum funding contribution as required and may make discretionary contributions  depending on certain circumstances  including market conditions and liquidity needs 
in august  the federal pension protection act of was enacted 
included in this law are changes to the method of valuing pension plan assets and liabilities for funding purposes  as well as minimum contribution levels required in we are currently evaluating the impact of this new pension law may have on our future funding requirements and our consolidated financial statements 
we increased the discount rate assumption used to measure the projected pension obligations from at december  to at december  the increase in discount rate is due to the general increase in long term interest rates during and the consequent effect on the yields of the hypothetical portfolio of long term corporate bonds  which are used to determine the discount rate 
our aggregated projected benefit obligation of all plans increased slightly from million at december  to million at december  at december   the supplemental retirement plans were unfunded with respect to their accumulated benefit obligation by million as determined by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas  whereas the usrip  eipp and crip were overfunded with respect to their accumulated benefit obligation by million 
the expected rate of return on pension plan assets should approximate the actual long term investment gain on those assets 
the expected rate of return on plan assets used to calculate annual expense was for the usrip and for the eipp for the twelve months ended december  and  and for the usrip for the twelve months ended december  in  the expected rate of return on plan assets used to calculate the annual sfas expense will be for the usrip and for the eipp 
for our non us  tax qualified retirement plans  we fund at least the amounts sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements but no more than allowed as a tax deduction pursuant to applicable tax regulations 
for the non qualified supplementary retirement plans  we fund the benefits as they are paid to retired participants  but accrue the associated expense and liabilities in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap

recent accounting pronouncements for information about new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
the following accounting policies involve a critical accounting estimate because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
in addition  while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income 
we also have other significant accounting policies  which involve the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that are relevant to understanding our results 
for additional information about these policies  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
although we believe that our estimates  assumptions and judgments are reasonable  they are based upon information presently available 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments or conditions 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  collectibility of arrangement consideration is reasonably assured  the arrangement fees are fixed or determinable and delivery of the product or service has been completed 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from our processing of transactions related to the provision of information services to our customers  in which case revenue is recognized  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  when the service is provided 
if at the outset of an arrangement  we determine that collectibility is not reasonably assured  revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment 
if there is uncertainty as to the customer s acceptance of our deliverables  revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
if at the outset of an arrangement  we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes estimable  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
the determination of certain of our marketing information services revenue requires the use of estimates  principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears 
in these instances  we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual reported volumes reported by our customers in the past 
differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported 
we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates and actual reported volumes in the past 
we monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future 
if we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates  revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained 
we have certain information solution offerings that are sold as multiple element arrangements 
the multiple elements may include consumer or commercial information  file updates for certain solutions  services provided by our enabling technologies personnel  training services and or statistical models 
to account for each of these elements separately  the delivered elements must have stand alone value to our customer  and there must exist objective and reliable evidence of the fair value for any undelivered elements 
for certain customer contracts  the total arrangement fee is allocated to the undelivered elements based on their fair values and to the initial delivered elements using the residual method 
if we are unable to unbundle the arrangement into separate elements for accounting  arrangement consideration may only be recognized as the final contract element is delivered to our customer 
valuation of goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets and long lived assets goodwill 
goodwill represents the cost in excess of the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses 
we review goodwill for impairment based on the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
these events or circumstances would include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of september th 
during  we were not required to test goodwill for impairment at an interim date 
in accordance with sfas  we are required to test goodwill at the reporting unit level as defined by reference to our operating segments determined under sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
in analyzing goodwill for potential impairment  we use projections of future discounted cash flows from our reporting units to determine whether the reporting unit s estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value 
these projections of cash flows are based on our views of growth rates  anticipated future economic conditions and the appropriate discount rates relative to risk and estimates of residual values 
we believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value 
our estimates of fair value for each reporting unit are corroborated by market multiple comparables 
the use of different estimates or assumptions within our projected discounted cash flows eg  growth rates  future economic conditions  discount rates and estimates of terminal values when determining the fair value of our reporting units could result in different values and could result in a goodwill impairment charge 
additionally  a change in our reporting unit structure would result in the requirement to test goodwill for impairment at different reporting units 
during the twelve months ended december   and  we had no impairment of our reporting unit goodwill balances 
for additional information about goodwill  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
as a result of the change in operating segments  effective january   our reporting units under which we test goodwill for impairment in accordance with sfas have also changed 
during the first quarter of  we have reallocated the goodwill associated with our previous reporting units  in accordance with sfas  to our new reporting units 
we are currently in the process of testing the goodwill related to our new reporting units for impairment 
indefinite lived intangible assets 
indefinite lived intangible assets consist of contractual territorial rights representing the estimated fair value of rights to operate in certain territories acquired through the purchase of independent credit reporting agencies in the us and canada 
our contractual territorial rights are perpetual in nature and  therefore  the useful lives are considered indefinite 
indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized 
in accordance with sfas  we are required to test indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events and circumstances change that would indicate the asset might be impaired 
we perform the impairment test for our indefinite lived intangible assets by comparing the asset s fair value to its carrying value 
an impairment charge is recognized if the asset s estimated fair value is less than its carrying value 
we perform our annual impairment test as of september th 
during  we were not required to test contractual territorial rights for impairment at an interim date 
we estimate the fair value of our contractual territorial rights based on projected discounted future cash flows 
the use of different estimates or assumptions within our discounted cash flow model when determining the fair value of our contractual territorial rights  or using a methodology other than a discounted cash flow model  could result in different values for our contractual territorial rights and could result in an impairment charge 
the most significant assumptions within our discounted cash flow model are the discount rate  growth rate and charge for contributory assets 
we believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value 
if any legal  regulatory  contractual  competitive  economic or other factors were to limit the useful lives of our indefinite lived intangible assets  we would be required to test these intangible assets for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  and amortize the intangible asset over its remaining useful life 
during the twelve months ended december   and  we recognized no impairment charges related to our contractual territorial rights 
for additional information about contractual territorial rights  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
long lived assets 
we monitor the status of our long lived assets annually or more frequently if necessary  in order to determine if conditions exist or events and circumstances indicate that an asset  or asset group  may be impaired in that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
significant factors that are considered that could be indicative of an impairment include changes in business strategy  market conditions or the manner in which an asset is used  underperformance relative to historical or expected future operating results  and negative industry or economic trends 
if potential indicators of impairment exist  we estimate recoverability based on the asset s  or asset group s  ability to generate cash flows greater than the carrying value of the asset  or asset group 
we estimate the undiscounted future cash flows arising from the use and eventual disposition of the related long lived asset  or asset group 
if the carrying value of the long lived asset  or asset group  exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows  an impairment loss is recorded based on the amount by which the asset s carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
we utilize the discounted present value of the associated future estimated cash flows to determine the asset s  or asset group s  fair value  which requires us to make assumptions regarding the discount rate 
the projected cash flows require several assumptions related to  among other things  relevant market factors  revenue growth  if any  and operating margins 
while we believe our assumptions are reasonable  changes in these assumptions in future periods may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
there were no impairment charges during the twelve months ended december  and during the twelve months ended december   we recorded a million impairment charge 
loss contingencies we are subject to various proceedings  lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of our business 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we determine whether to disclose and or accrue for loss contingencies based on our assessment of whether the potential loss is probable  reasonably possible or remote 
we periodically review claims and legal proceedings and assess whether we have potential financial exposure based on consultation with internal and outside legal counsel and other advisors 
if the likelihood of an adverse outcome from any claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we record a liability in our consolidated balance sheet for the estimated settlement costs 
if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is reasonably possible  but not probable  we provide disclosures related to the potential loss contingency 
our assumptions related to loss contingencies are inherently subjective 
changes in these assumptions in future periods or an outcome different than our assumption may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
for additional information about our contingencies  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we are required to assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount we estimate will be recoverable 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income 
a valuation allowance is currently set against certain net deferred tax assets because we believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized through the generation of future taxable income or other tax planning strategies 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets 
our income tax provisions are based on assumptions and calculations which will be subject to examination by various tax authorities 
we record tax benefits for positions in which we believe they are probable of being sustained under such examinations 
regularly  we assess the potential outcome of such examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax accruals 
we adjust our income tax provision during the period in which we determine that the actual results of the examinations may differ from our estimates 
changes in tax laws and rates are reflected in our income tax provision in the period in which they occur 
changes in these assumptions in future periods or actual results different from our estimates may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
for additional information about our income taxes  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
pension plans our pension plans are accounted for using actuarial valuations required by sfas and  for the twelve months ended december   sfas our prepaid pension asset and total accrued pension benefit liability including short term and long term liabilities  in accordance with sfas  as of december   were million  or of total assets  and million  or of the total liabilities  respectively  on our consolidated balance sheet 
we consider accounting for our us and canadian pension plans critical because our management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions  which include discount rates  salary growth  expected return on plan assets  interest cost and mortality rates 
we believe that the most significant assumptions related to our net periodic benefit cost are the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is primarily based on two methods prepared by an external advisor which consider  among other things  the expected equity returns based on assumptions such as dividend yield and growth rate  and estimated risk premium for various asset categories 
these assumptions are projected using an asset liability forecasting model  which produces a range and distribution of values for the assumed rate of return 
adjusting our expected long term rate of return at december  by would change our estimated pension expense in by approximately million 
we determine our discount rates primarily based on high quality  fixed income investments and yield to maturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments 
adjusting our weighted average discount rate at december  by would change our estimated pension expense in by approximately million 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the pension expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
for additional information about our pension plans  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of our business  we are exposed to market risk  primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and  to a lesser extent  to changes in interest rates  that could impact our results of operations and financial position 
we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities  and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate swaps  to hedge certain of these exposures 
we use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading purposes 
foreign currency exchange rate risk a substantial majority of our revenue  expense and capital expenditure activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  we do transact business in other currencies  primarily the british pound  the euro  the canadian dollar and the brazilian real 
for most of these foreign currencies  we are a net recipient  and  therefore  benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business 
we are required to translate  or express in us dollars  the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated or measured in foreign currencies at the applicable year end rate of exchange on our consolidated balance sheets and income statement items of our foreign subsidiaries at the average rates prevailing during the year 
we record the resulting translation adjustment  and gains and losses resulting from the translation of intercompany balances of a long term investment nature within other comprehensive income  as a component of our shareholders equity 
other immaterial foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in our consolidated statements of income 
we do not  as a matter of policy  hedge translational foreign currency exposure 
we may  however  hedge transactional foreign currency exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency 
at december   a weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during would have increased our revenue by million and our pre tax operating profit by million 
at december   a weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during would have increased our revenue by million and our pre tax operating profit by million 
a stronger us dollar would have resulted in similar decreases to our revenue and pre tax operating profit for and interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our variable rate  long term revolving credit facility and trade receivables backed revolving credit facility 
we attempt to achieve the lowest all in weighted average cost of debt while simultaneously taking into account the mix of our fixed and floating rate debt  and the average life and scheduled maturities of our debt 
at december   our weighted average cost of debt was and weighted average life of debt was years 
at december   of our debt was fixed rate  and the remaining was variable rate 
occasionally we use derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into interest rate swaps 
based on current mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt  which is comparable to the prior year  we do not have material exposure to interest rate risk 
in the future  if our mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt were to change due to additional borrowings under existing variable rate credit facilities or new variable rate debt instruments  we could have exposure to interest rate risk 
the nature and amount of our long term and short term debt  as well as the proportionate amount of fixed rate and variable rate debt  can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors
