item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our operations we are a leading  diversified  multi jurisdictional owner and operator of gaming and pari mutuel properties 
we now own or operate seventeen facilities in thirteen jurisdictions  including colorado  illinois  indiana  iowa  louisiana  maine  mississippi  missouri  new jersey  ohio  pennsylvania  west virginia and ontario 
in addition  on november   we agreed to acquire zia park racetrack and its black gold casino zia park in new mexico 
the transaction is expected to close mid  subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions  including regulatory approval 
we believe that our portfolio of assets provides us with a diversified cash flow from operations 
we have made significant acquisitions in the past few years  and expect to continue to pursue additional acquisition and development opportunities in the future 
on march   we acquired hollywood casino corporation  which significantly increased our revenues and cash flow 
on february   we purchased bangor historic track  inc  in bangor  maine 
on october   we completed our largest acquisition to date  acquiring argosy gaming company argosy 
in early november  we opened a temporary gaming facility in bangor  maine 
on july   pennsylvania governor edward g 
rendell signed into law the pennsylvania race horse development and gaming act 
our plan is to develop a completely new gaming and racing facility at our penn national race course in grantville  pennsylvania 
under this plan  we expect to open a new permanent facility with  slot machines around the first quarter of at an estimated cost of million  inclusive of the million gaming license fee  with the ability to add  machines as soon as demand warrants 
we have a master plan to accommodate up to  gaming devices  based on demand 
in late december  the pennsylvania gaming control board the pgcb granted us a category slot machine license 
the vast majority of our revenues is gaming revenue  derived primarily from gaming on slot machines and  to a lesser extent  table games 
other revenues are derived from our management service fee from casino rama  our hotel  dining  retail  admissions  program sales  concessions and certain other ancillary activities  and our racing operations 
our racing revenue is derived from wagering on our live races  wagering on import simulcasts at our racetracks and off track wagering facilities otws and through account wagering  and fees from wagering on export simulcasting our races 
beginning in the first quarter of  we modified our segment reporting from two reportable segments to one reportable segment  as we believe that our gaming and racing properties can now be aggregated together in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas  due to ongoing changes at our racing properties  including the upcoming introduction of slot machines at penn national race course 
we intend to continue to expand our gaming operations through the implementation of a disciplined capital expenditure program at our existing properties and the continued pursuit of strategic acquisitions of gaming properties  particularly in attractive regional markets 
key performance indicators related to revenues are gaming revenue indicators slot handle volume indicator  table game drop volume indicator and win or hold percentages 
our typical property slot win percentage is in the range of to of slot handle and our typical table games win percentage is in the range of to of table game drop  and racing revenue indicators pari mutuel wagering commissions volume indicator earned on wagering on our live races  wagering on import simulcasts at our racetracks and otws and through account wagering  and fees from wagering on export simulcasting our races at out of state locations 
our properties generate significant operating cash flow  since most of our revenue is cash based from slot machines and pari mutuel wagering 
our business is capital intensive  and we rely on cash flow from our properties to generate operating cash to repay debt  fund capital maintenance expenditures  fund new capital projects at existing properties and provide excess cash for future development and acquisitions

argosy casino lawrenceburg continues to move forward with the construction of a planned casino development 
the development includes a  space parking garage  a two level  square foot riverboat  and numerous infrastructure upgrades to allow more convenient access to the property 
due to ongoing environmental and archeological studies at the site  the expected opening date for the parking facility will now be the second quarter of  while the expanded casino floor will now open in the second quarter of the new riverboat will allow up to  positions on one level  and another positions will be added to the second level  along with restaurants and other amenities on the gaming riverboat 
in late december  the pgcb granted us a category slot machine license for the placement of slot machines at our planned hollywood casino racing and gaming facility at penn national race course 
in august  we commenced construction of the integrated racing and gaming facility at penn national race course 
in preparation for the construction  we closed and razed the aged grandstand and clubhouse at penn national race course  and opened a new  square foot temporary facility offering pari mutuel wagering  food and beverage services  more than television monitors  administrative offices and facilities for jockeys 
the hollywood casino at penn national will be a  square foot facility  and will be sized for  slot machines  with  positions planned at opening 
in late december  we completed the purchase of the former holiday inn in bangor  maine  where we will be building the permanent hollywood slots at bangor facility 
due to the results currently generated by our temporary facility and a substantial number of patrons driving significant distances to hollywood slots at bangor  we are adding a hotel to the plans for the permanent facility  which will feature a two story  semi circular  glass tower casino area  a four story parking garage  restaurants  retail space and a new simulcast facility for off track wagering 
construction of the facility  which will open with  slot machines and have capacity for  gaming machines  is planned to commence in the first half of  following the demolition of the existing hotel and adjacent buildings 
at the charles town entertainment complex  we completed construction of a seat buffet and a new parking garage  which doubled our structured parking to  spaces 
in addition  we continue to build and develop the charles town entertainment complex  with the current expansion of the property including a hotel and a  square foot expansion of the gaming floor 
the expansion of the gaming floor  which is expected to be completed in two phases  will enable us to initially add more slot machines  with capacity for an additional  slot machines thereafter 
we expect the opening of the first phase of expansion to occur in may argosy casino riverside continues to make progress on the room hotel that is expected to open in april in may  the illinois legislature passed into law house bill  effective may   which singled out four of the nine illinois casinos  including our empress casino hotel and hollywood casino aurora  for a tax surcharge to subsidize local horse racing interests 
we began paying this tax surcharge during the three months ended june   and we will continue to pay this tax surcharge in upcoming periods 
on may   empress casino hotel and hollywood casino aurora joined with the two other riverboats affected by the law  harrah s joliet and the grand victoria casino in elgin  and filed suit in the circuit court of the twelfth judicial district in will county  illinois the court  asking the court to declare the law unconstitutional 
the state agreed to the entry of an order that establishes a protest fund for all of the tax surcharge payments and enjoins the treasurer from making any payments out of that fund pending the final outcome of the litigation 
should the casinos prevail with their challenge  the incremental taxes paid under protest would be refunded 
we anticipate a long process before a resolution to this matter can be reached 
in ohio  as the owner of raceway park in toledo  we provided support during for a proposed constitutional amendment that would have established a tuition grant program for ohio students to attend public or private colleges in the state by allowing up to  slot machines at each of the state s seven existing racetracks and two locations in downtown cleveland 
on november   the proposed constitutional amendment was voted down by ohio citizens 
our efforts and funding of this referendum reduced our earnings on a short term basis 
in april  we entered into million of new interest rate swap agreements  which brought our swapped portion of libor rate debt to billion 
the effective date of the swap agreements was may   and will be for a period of five years 
on march   we redeemed million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior subordinated notes due march  the redemption price was  per  principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the scheduled redemption date 
we funded the redemption of the notes from available cash and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
for  we will be focused on the above initiatives and other factors affecting the business similar to the drivers of our results  as discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the risks to achieving our financial objectives for are discussed in the risk factors and important factors regarding forward looking statements sections of this annual report on form k for the year ended december  critical accounting policies we make certain judgments and use certain estimates and assumptions when applying accounting principles in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the nature of the estimates and assumptions are material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain factors or the susceptibility of such factors to change 
we have identified the policies related to the accounting for long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes and litigation  claims and assessments as critical accounting policies  which require us to make significant judgments  estimates and assumptions 
we believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  and in certain situations  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
the development and selection of the critical accounting policies  and the related disclosures  have been reviewed with the audit committee of our board of directors 
long lived assets at december   we had a net property and equipment balance of  million  representing of total assets 
we depreciate property and equipment on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
the estimated useful lives are determined based on the nature of the assets as well as our current operating strategy 
we review the carrying value of our property and equipment for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
the factors considered by us in performing this assessment include current operating results  trends and prospects  as well as the effect of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors 
in estimating expected future cash flows for determining whether an asset is impaired  assets are grouped at the individual property level 
in assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of property and equipment  we must make assumptions regarding future cash flows and other factors 
if these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment loss for these assets 
such an impairment loss would be calculated based upon the discounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset  and would be recognized as a non cash component of operating income 
goodwill and other intangible assets at december   we had  million in goodwill and million in other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet  representing and of total assets  respectively  resulting from our acquisition of other businesses 
two issues arise with respect to these assets that require significant management estimates and judgment i the valuation in connection with the initial purchase price allocation  and ii the ongoing evaluation for impairment 
in connection with our acquisitions  valuations were completed to determine the allocation of the purchase prices 
the factors considered in the valuations included data gathered as a result of our due diligence in connection with the acquisitions and projections for future operations 
goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment by comparing the fair value of the recorded assets to their carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we consider our gaming license and trademark intangible assets as indefinite life intangible assets that do not require amortization 
rather  these intangible assets are tested at least annually for impairment by comparing the fair value of the recorded assets to their carrying amount 
if the carrying amounts of the gaming license and trademark intangible assets exceed their fair value  an impairment loss is recognized 
the annual evaluation of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets requires the use of estimates about future operating results of each reporting unit to determine their estimated fair value 
changes in forecasted operations can materially affect these estimates 
once an impairment of goodwill or other indefinite life intangible assets has been recorded  it cannot be reversed 
because our goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are not amortized  there may be volatility in reported income because impairment losses  if any  are likely to occur irregularly and in varying amounts 
intangible assets that have a definite life  including the management service contract for casino rama  are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives or related service contract 
we review the carrying value of our intangible assets that have a definite life for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
if the carrying amount of the intangible assets that have a definite life exceed their fair value  an impairment loss is recognized 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
under sfas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and are measured at the prevailing enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences are settled or realized 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the realizability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated quarterly by assessing the valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of the allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
we have used tax planning strategies to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in each jurisdiction 
these audits can involve complex issues that may require an extended period of time to resolve 
in our opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all periods 
litigation  claims and assessments we utilize estimates for litigation  claims and assessments 
these estimates are based on our knowledge and experience regarding current and past events  as well as assumptions about future events 
if our assessment of such a matter should change  we may have to change the estimate  which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
results of operations the following are the most important factors and trends that contribute to our operating performance most of our properties operate in mature competitive markets 
as a result  we expect a majority of our future growth to come from prudent acquisitions of gaming properties  jurisdictional expansions such as pennsylvania and maine and property expansion in under penetrated markets 
the continued pressure on governments to balance their budgets could intensify the efforts of state and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes 
a number of states are currently considering or implementing legislation to legalize or expand gaming 
such legislation presents both potential opportunities to establish new properties for instance  in pennsylvania and ohio and potential competitive threats to business at our existing properties such as maryland  ohio  and kentucky 
the timing and occurrence of these events remain uncertain 
legalized gaming from casinos located on native american lands can also have a significant competitive effect 
the continued demand for  and our emphasis on  slot wagering entertainment at our properties 
the ongoing successful expansion and revenue gains at our charles town entertainment complex  argosy casino lawrenceburg  hollywood casino at penn national race course  hollywood slots at bangor and argosy casino riverside facilities 
financing in a favorable interest rate environment and under an improved credit profile that facilitates our growth 
the impact of hurricane katrina on our facilities  our future insurance rates and the mississippi gulf coast market 
the successful execution of the development and construction activities currently underway at a number of our facilities  as well as the risks associated with the costs  regulatory approval  and the timing for these activities
