item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations together with the selected consolidated financial data included in item above and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in addition to historical financial information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  as amended  and within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual 
table of contents results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this document  particularly in the section entitled risk factors 
readers are cautioned that any forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results  performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements in this annual report on form k are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions including  among other things our ability to raise the necessary capital to fund our operations and to develop and commercialize our products  our ability to successfully design and conduct our planned clinical trials  our ability to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies in our acquisitions  and to successfully integrate the operations  business and technology obtained in our acquisitions  general economic and business conditions in our markets  the impact of current  pending or future legislation and regulation of our businesses in the us and abroad  our expectations and estimates concerning future financial performance  financing plans and the impact of competition  and the impact of technological developments and competition 
in light of these risks and uncertainties  the forward looking events and circumstances discussed in this annual report on form k might not occur 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements made herein because of new information  future events or otherwise 
overview our business activities are reported in three reporting segments i molecular services  which is comprised of the operations of pgxhealth and cogenics  ii clinics and small hospitals  which represents sales of diagnostic equipment  consumables and services to small to medium sized clinics  hospitals and laboratories through vital scientific and electa lab  and iii all other  which includes corporate related items and income and expense not allocated to reportable segments 
as a result of the integration and re branding of the genaissance  icoria and genome express acquisitions into pgxhealth and cogenics  we believe we are now a worldwide leader in providing molecular services  pharmacogenomics  genetic testing and clinical diagnostics to improve patient care 
our genomic services are marketed to the pharmaceutical  biotechnology  clinical  academic  government and agricultural marketplaces 
we are utilizing pharmacogenomics to develop genetic based tests and diagnostics and more efficacious therapeutics by finding genetic markers to guide drug development and utilization 
vilazodone  our therapeutic drug for depression  is in phase iii clinical development 
our future success in molecular services will depend in large part on maintaining a competitive position in the genomics field  a field that has undergone  and is expected to continue to undergo  rapid and significant change 
competition in the pharmacogenomics and molecular services market is intense and includes pharmaceutical  biotechnology and diagnostic companies  academic and research institutions and government and other publicly funded agencies  both in the us and abroad 
our future success in this highly competitive market depends on our ability to demonstrate that our recently acquired technology platforms  know how  and informatics technologies and capabilities are superior to those of such competitors and our ability to advance technologies and genetic testing franchises 
in addition  we must continue to contain costs and move toward profitability while growing revenues wherever possible 

table of contents funding the continued development of vilazodone is another challenge that we face in our molecular services business 
we currently do not have the cash reserves or the revenue from other sources to fund such development 
in order to successfully commercialize this drug candidate  we will be required to either partner with a third party that has sufficient resources or raise capital through the sale of our equity and debt securities 
establishing a partnership with another company could have an impact on the future revenues we can expect to receive from vilazodone if we have to share some portion of such revenues with a development partner 
additionally  fund raising could serve to dilute our stockholders 
we also face challenges with respect to our recent acquisitions 
the continued integration of these operations has required significant efforts from each company  including the coordination of product development  sales and marketing efforts and administrative operations that will continue to be a time consuming and complex process 
given that genaissance  icoria and genome express have a history of incurring significant net losses  we face the challenge of successfully integrating these businesses into companies that will generate sufficient revenue to become profitable and sustain profitability alleviating the need for external financing 
with respect to our diagnostic instrumentation operations  revenues from clinical laboratory testing are anticipated to grow as a result of the aging of the population  increased healthcare awareness and expanding insurance coverage 
the present focus  however  on greater efficiency in disease management and on reducing health care costs exposes our customers to a constant pressure to contain costs 
consequently  in order to remain competitive and gain market share in these growing markets  it is essential for us to continue to provide cost effective technologies 
competition in the medical products industry  which includes our diagnostic instrumentation and reagent businesses  is intense and expected to increase as new products  technologies and services become available and new competitors enter the market 
our competitors in the united states  europe and asia pacific are numerous and include  among others  large  multi national diagnostic testing and medical products companies 
our future success depends upon maintaining a competitive position in the development and distribution of products and other technologies for use in smaller clinical laboratories 
in order to grow  gain market share and remain competitive  we must continue to introduce new products and technologies  and invest in research and development 
financial operations overview revenues 
the most significant portion of our revenue from services relates to fee for service arrangements related to molecular services or diagnostic and genetic tests deliveries 
revenue for fee for service arrangements are recognized upon the later of service delivery or  if applicable  customer acceptance 
we maintain relationships with certain healthcare providers as well as healthcare insurance companies  revenue from these arrangements is recognized net of contractual allowances 
our revenues from the sale of diagnostic equipment and consumables are recognized at the time when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
product revenues are generally recognized upon shipments

table of contents including salaries and related expenses for personnel  including stock based compensation expenses  costs of materials  depreciation  rent  utilities and other facilities costs 
during  we recognized million of expense related to the acquisition of vilazodone manufacturing and technology rights from merck kgaa merck 
we expense research and development costs as incurred

other costs primarily include facility costs and professional fees for accounting  consulting and legal services  including patent related expenses 
purchased research and development expense 
purchased research and development expense represents the value of the in process research and development projects at genaissance and icoria that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative use at their dates of acquisition in fiscal such costs were expensed in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 business combinations see note to the consolidated financial statements for the method and assumptions used to value the in process research and development 
interest and other income expense  net 
interest expense consists of interest incurred under notes payable and other debt financings and capital lease obligations 
interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
other income expense  net consists primarily of foreign currency gains losses 
preferred stock dividends 
preferred stock dividends consists of dividends accrued on the outstanding shares of series a voting convertible preferred stock the series a preferred stock issued in connection with the acquisition of genaissance on october  dividends on outstanding shares are payable on january th and july th of each year  when and if declared by the board of directors 
as of march   the cumulative dividends accrued on the series a preferred stock totaled  a portion of our balance sheet is denominated in euros  the functional currency of our dutch operations 
the effect of translation of these local currencies into us dollars for reporting purposes is reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity 
the gains or losses from foreign currency transactions are included in other income expense and have not been material to the financial statements 
the euro strengthened against the us dollar by during fiscal and weakened against the us dollar by during fiscal from the respective prior fiscal year s closing rates 
the results of our european operations can be significantly impacted by changes in these foreign exchange rates 
periodically we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the exposure to currency fluctuations on customer accounts receivable denominated in foreign currency 
the objective of these contracts is to minimize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on operating results 
derivative financial instruments are not used for speculative or trading purposes 
there were foreign exchange forward contracts with a notional value of  outstanding at march  the fair value of these instruments at march  was de minimis 
gains and losses related to these derivative instruments for fiscal  and were not significant 
we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows resulting from the use of these instruments 
however  there can be no assurance that these strategies will be effective or that transaction losses can be minimized or forecasted accurately 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements and notes  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make 
table of contents estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue  allowances for doubtful accounts  inventory  intangibles  goodwill  accrued expenses and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the most significant portion of our revenue from services relates to fee for service arrangements related to molecular services or diagnostic and genetic tests deliveries 
revenue for fee for service arrangements are recognized upon the later of service delivery or  if applicable  customer acceptance 
we maintain relationships with certain healthcare providers as well as healthcare insurance companies  revenue from these arrangements is recognized net of contractual allowances 
revenues from the molecular services segment are also derived from fees for licenses of intellectual property  commercial partnerships and government contracts and grants 
revenue from commercial contracts are generally related to service fees  milestone achievements and deliveries of molecular services data  diagnostic and genetic tests  and assays 
revenue for service fees and milestone achievements from commercial contracts are recognized as revenues based on the completed contract method 
to the extent payments received exceed revenue recognized for each contract or grant  the excess portion of such payments is recorded as deferred revenues 
to the extent revenues recognized exceed payments received for each contract  the excess revenues are recorded as accounts receivable 
revenue from government contracts and grants  which are typically cost plus arrangements  are recognized as revenues as related expenses are incurred over the term of each contract or grant 
revenue from arrangement with multiple deliverables is divided into separate units of accounting when certain criteria are met 
the consideration for the arrangement is then allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values 
applicable revenue recognition criteria are then applied separately for each unit of accounting 
we defer revenue of multiple element arrangements if the fair values of all deliverables are not known or if customer acceptance is contingent on delivery of specified items or performance conditions 
because we often lack evidence of fair value for commercial partnership contracts  revenue is deferred until the contract is completed and all elements have been delivered 
our revenues from the sale of diagnostic equipment and consumables are recognized at the time when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
product revenues are generally recognized upon shipments 
generally  we receive a customer purchase order as evidence of an arrangement and product shipment terms are free on board fob shipping point 
returns and customer credits are infrequent and are recorded as a reduction to revenue 
rights of return or refund are generally not included in sales arrangements 
payments received under our commercial contracts and government contracts and grants are generally non refundable regardless of the outcome of the future research and development activities to be performed by us 
allowance for doubtful accounts allowances for doubtful accounts are maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these estimated allowances of   and  at march   and  respectively  are periodically reviewed  analyzing the customers payment history and information known to us regarding customers credit worthiness 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
inventory quantities are periodically reviewed and  when necessary  provisions for excess and obsolete inventories are 
table of contents provided 
on an ongoing basis  we review the carrying value of the inventory and record an inventory adjustment at such time as it is believed that the carrying value exceeds the inventory s net realizable value 
such assessments are based upon historical sales  forecasted sales  market conditions and information derived from our sales and marketing professionals 
in addition  certain of our products are perishable  and in the event that the product is not sold before the expiration date  such inventory is written off as soon as it is determined that the product is no longer marketable due to the expiration date 
the product is then disposed 
valuation of intangibles as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we completed four business combinations during fiscal in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  the transactions have been accounted for based on fair value 
as a result of the purchase price allocations  we recorded purchased intangibles totaling million and goodwill totaling million in the molecular services segment  and goodwill of million in the clinics and small hospitals segment 
the fair value of the purchased intangibles was determined based on either discounted probable cash flows or replacement costs 
the interest rates used to discount the net cash flows to their present value were based on our weighted average cost of capital ranging between and 
for a description of the purchased intangibles and their respective fair values  please see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  we perform an annual impairment test of the carrying value of goodwill using december as our selected annual evaluation date 
the fair value of our recorded intangibles can be impacted by economic conditions  market risks  and the volatility in the markets in which we and our customers operate 
changes in fair value could result in future impairment charges if the fair value of the reporting units or asset groups to which these long lived assets are associated are determined to be less than the carrying value of such assets 
as of december   the most recent evaluation date  there was no impairment of such goodwill 
in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  when facts and circumstances suggest that there may be impairment  we will assess the carrying value of amortizing intangibles  including purchased intangibles 
when a potential impairment has been identified  forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operations to which the asset relates are compared to the current carrying value of the assets present in that operations 
if such cash flows are less than such carrying amounts  such intangibles are written down to their respective fair values 
the results of these periodic impairment tests can be impacted by our future expected operating results and cash flows  economic conditions  market risks  and the volatility in the markets in which we and our customers operate 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we assessed the recoverability of certain intangible assets acquired in the icoria transaction 
this assessment was conducted in connection with the development of our fiscal budget 
based on the projections for fiscal  we concluded that certain assets were impaired and we recorded a million impairment 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services which have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of services performed and the associated cost incurred for such services as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements 
examples of estimated expenses for which we accrue include contract service fees  such as amounts paid to clinical monitors  data management organizations  clinical sites and investigators in conjunction with clinical trials  and fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of materials for clinical and non clinical trials  and professional service fees 
in connection with these service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided relative to the actual levels of services incurred by such service providers 
in the event that we do not identify costs which have begun to be incurred or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for such period would be too low or too high 
the date  on which specified services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services is often judgmental 
we attempt to mitigate the risk of inaccurate estimates  in part  by communicating with our service providers when other evidence of costs incurred is unavailable 

table of contents income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
as of march   we had federal tax net operating loss carryforwards  after limitation for the change in ownership  of million  which expire starting in  federal tax credit carryforwards of million and net deferred tax assets of million 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as an offset against these otherwise recognizable net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of the realization of the tax benefit 
in the event that we determine in the future that we will be able to realize all or a portion of our net deferred tax asset  an adjustment to the deferred tax valuation allowance would increase net income in the period in which such a determination is made 
results of operations fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  fiscal includes the operations of pgxhealth  cogenics and electa lab for a month period while fiscal includes their operations since their dates of acquisition only 
pgxhealth and cogenics are the surviving operations of the genaissance  icoria and genome express acquisitions in october  december and march  respectively

during fiscal  the respective payments were approximately  and  at march   the restructuring and integration reserves totaled approximately  which is solely attributable to severance costs 
we expect these costs will be fully paid during fiscal on june   we issued convertible promissory notes to two affiliates of randal j 
kirk  the chairman of our board of directors 
the lenders provided us with million to fund working capital needs until such time as we could complete a new private placement to certain institutional and accredited investors 
the notes  which were payable thirty days from the date of issuance  accrued interest at a rate of per annum and were convertible at the option of the holders into the same type of security sold by us to investors in the first financing following issuance  at a price per share equal to the last reported closing bid price of the our common stock as reported on the nasdaq on the date of issuance

we recorded a loss on disposal in fiscal of approximately  in connection with the sale 
we engaged lazard to seek a buyer for the sale of cdss 
lazard identified a list of potential buyers  who were contacted  and we received several letters of interest to purchase cdss 
we accepted the most favorable offer which was to sell cdss to adrian tennyenhuis and new river management iv  lp for net proceeds of approximately million 
the transaction  structured as a share purchase  closed on june  under the terms of the transaction  approximately million of the net proceeds from the sale will be required to retire a line of credit held by lasalle bank 
we recorded a loss on disposal in fiscal of approximately million in connection with the sale 
on june   we received million from the settlement of litigation we filed against a third party for breach of contract 
during fiscal  we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately million primarily to introduce new products  improve production processing of existing and planned product offerings and to upgrade our laboratory information systems 
we expect to use our available cash and capital leases to fund these expenditures 
our sources of cash as of june   include our cash and cash equivalents balance of approximately million  cash flows from our ivd operations  capital leases and possible future equity and or debt financings 
our projected uses of cash include cash used in molecular services segment  capital expenditures  existing debt service costs and continued development of vilazodone and other potential products through internal research  collaborations and  possibly through strategic acquisitions 
as part of our strategy  we continually evaluate possible mergers  acquisitions and investments 
the financing of such activities is evaluated as part of our review of any opportunity 
at currently projected rates of expenditure  we believe that additional funding will be required to operate our business beyond the second quarter of fiscal  including the funding of phase iii clinical trials for our lead drug candidate  vilazodone 
we are considering several options for raising additional funds such as public or private offerings of equity or debt  or other financing arrangements 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain any required additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned research  development and commercialization activities  including our efforts related to vilazodone  hap and other new technologies  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
additional equity financing may be dilutive to the holders of our common stock and debt financing  if available  may involve significant cash payment obligations and covenants that restrict our ability to operate our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in interest rates  as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and each other 
we attempt to minimize some of these risks by using foreign currency forward and swap contracts 
these hedging activities provide only limited protection against interest rate and currency exchange risks 
factors that could influence the effectiveness of our programs include volatility of the interest rate and currency markets and availability of hedging instruments 
all interest rate swap and currency contracts that we enter into are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated interest rate and currency exposure  not for speculation 
interest rate risk we use a combination of fixed rate term loans  variable rate lines of credit and fixed rate leases to finance our activities 
our term loans and leases are all at fixed rates over their lives and carry no interest rate risk 
as a result of our existing variable rate credit lines and loan agreements  we are exposed to risk from changes in interest rates 
as of march   we had a convertible note with an outstanding balance of million 
table of contents carrying an interest rate of over prime 
a hypothetical change in interest rates would not materially impact our annual interest expense 
foreign exchange the value of certain foreign currencies as compared to the us dollar may affect our financial results 
fluctuations in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our revenues  gross margins  operating expenses  and retained earnings  all of which are expressed in us dollars 
where we deem it prudent  we engage in hedging programs  using primarily foreign currency forward and swap contracts  aimed at limiting the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on earnings 
we purchase short term foreign currency forward and swap contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with long term intercompany loans due to our international subsidiaries and the payment of merchandise purchases to foreign vendors 
we do not hedge the translation of foreign currency profits into us dollars  as we regard this as an accounting and not an economic exposure 
as of march   we had outstanding foreign currency forward and swap contracts aggregating  all of which related to intercompany debt 
the fair value of the forward contracts and the related gains and losses were not material as of and for the year ended march
