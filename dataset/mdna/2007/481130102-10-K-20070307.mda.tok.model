the increase in total operating costs and expenses was due to the television operations we acquired in december  the impact of the extra week  and an increase in commercial printing  journal interactive and commercial delivery costs at our daily newspaper

our consolidated ebitda in was million  an increase of million  or  compared to million in we define ebitda as net earnings excluding gain loss from discontinued operations  net  provision for income taxes  total other expense which is entirely comprised of interest income and expense  depreciation and amortization 
our management uses ebitda  among other things  to evaluate our operating performance  to value prospective acquisitions and as a component of incentive compensation targets for certain management personnel 
ebitda is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
ebitda should not be considered in isolation of  or as a substitute for  net earnings as an indicator of operating performance or cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
ebitda  as we calculate it  may not be comparable to ebitda measures reported by other companies

we do not rely on off balance sheet arrangements for liquidity  capital resources  market risk support  credit risk support or other benefits 
critical accounting policies our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related footnote disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to doubtful accounts  property and equipment  intangible assets  income taxes  litigation  and pension and other postretirement benefits 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are 
table of contents believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we do not believe our past results have differed materially from these estimates  however  we cannot predict how actual results may differ from these estimates in the future 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
we specifically review historical write off activity by market  large customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us such as bankruptcy filings  credit history  etc  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due us to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on past loss history  the length of time the receivables are past due and the current business environment 
if our evaluations of the collectibility of our accounts receivable differ from actual results  increases or decreases in bad debt expense and allowances may be required 
property and equipment and definite lived intangibles we assign useful lives for our property and equipment and definite lived intangibles based on our estimate of the amount of time that we will use those assets and we have selected the straight line method to depreciate our property and equipment and definite lived intangibles 
a change in the estimated useful lives or the depreciation or amortization method used could have a material impact upon our results of operations 
we evaluate our property and equipment and definite lived intangibles for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
accounting standards require that  if the sum of the future cash flows expected to result from an asset or group of assets  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the carrying amount of the asset or group of assets  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the estimated future cash flows related to an asset or group of assets is highly susceptible to change because we must make assumptions about future revenue and the related cost of sales 
changes in our assumptions could require us to recognize a loss for asset impairment 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles goodwill and broadcast licenses account for and of total assets in and  respectively 
the annual impairment tests for goodwill and broadcast licenses under statement no 
require us to make certain assumptions in determining fair value  including assumptions about cash flow growth rates of our businesses 
additionally  the fair values are significantly impacted by factors including competitive industry valuations and long term interest rates that exist at the time the annual impairment tests are performed 
accordingly  we may incur additional impairment charges in future periods under statement no 
to the extent we do not achieve our expected cash flow growth rates  and to the extent that market values and long term interest rates in general decrease and increase  respectively 
accrued income taxes the internal revenue service irs and various state departments of revenue routinely examine our federal and state tax returns 
from time to time  the irs and the state departments of revenue may challenge certain of our tax positions 
we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law  and we would vigorously defend these positions if challenged 
the final disposition of any positions challenged by the irs or 
table of contents state departments of revenue could require us to make additional tax payments or have an impact on our effective tax rate 
nonetheless  we believe that we have adequately reserved for any foreseeable payments related to such matters and consequently do not anticipate any material earnings impact from the ultimate resolution of such matters 
as of december  and december   we recorded liabilities to cover additional tax exposure items of million and million  respectively 
accrued litigation we are subject to various legal actions  administrative proceedings and claims 
when necessary  we may need to record a liability for an estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of such claims 
the estimate would be developed in consultation with counsel and would be based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
we believe that such unresolved legal actions and claims would not materially affect our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
employee benefits we are self insured for a majority of our employee related health and disability benefits and workers compensation claims 
third party administrators are used to process all claims 
liabilities for unpaid claims are based on our historical claims experience 
liabilities for workers compensation claims are developed from actuarial valuations 
actual amounts could vary significantly from such estimates which would require us to record additional expense in the future 
we rely upon actuarial valuations to determine pension costs and funding 
there are certain assumptions that have a significant effect on our obligations  such as the discount rate used to arrive at the net present value of the obligations and expense  the return on assets used to estimate the growth in invested asset value available to satisfy certain obligations  the salary increases used to calculate the impact future pay increases will have on pension obligations  and the employee turnover statistics used to estimate the number of employees to be paid pension benefits 
the assumptions used in accounting for pension benefits and other postretirement benefits for and are pension benefits other postretirement benefits discount rate for expense discount rate for obligations rate of compensation increases for expense rate of compensation increases for obligations expected return on plan assets for our pension plans  a one percent increase or decrease in the discount rate would have lowered by million or raised by million  respectively  the plans expense and would have lowered the plans projected benefit obligations by million or raised by million  respectively  as of december  to determine the discount rate assumptions for the pension and the postretirement benefit plans  we commissioned our actuarial firms to study our plans specific discount rate by matching our projected benefit payments to a yield curve developed from high grade corporate bonds 
the results of those studies were used as the benchmark to determine the discount rate assumptions 
in addition  we used the moody s aa corporate bonds  as of the measurement dates  as another reference point to support our decision 

table of contents to determine the long term rate of return assumption for pension plan assets  we study historical markets and preserve the long term historical relationships between equities and fixed income securities consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run 
we evaluate current market factors such as inflation and interest rates before we determine long term capital market assumptions 
we review peer data and historical returns to check for reasonability and appropriateness 
we make other assumptions that affect the accounting for pension benefits  such as the rate of compensation increase 
changes in these assumptions affect the benefit obligations and the service and interest cost components of the pension plan and the other postretirement plan and the required funding of the pension plan 
we review these assumptions on an annual basis 
we also rely upon actuarial valuations to determine postretirement benefit costs other than pension 
we provide our actuarial firm with the assumption of the discount rate and medical cost inflation 
these assumptions could have a significant effect on our obligation 
the discount rate is used to arrive at the net present value of the obligation 
the health care cost trend rate is used to calculate the impact future medical costs would have on postretirement obligations 
new accounting standards in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r  which requires an employer to a recognize in its statement of financial position an asset for a plan s overfunded status or a liability for a plan s underfunded status  b measure a plan s assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer s fiscal year with limited exceptions  and c recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in the year in which the changes occur 
these changes are reported in comprehensive income 
in accordance with the new standard  we adopted statement no 
on december  in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements  which provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
statement no 
applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value but does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
under statement no 
 fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts 
in this standard  the fasb clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability 
in support of this principle  statement no 
establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data  for example  the reporting entity s own data 
under the standard  fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
in accordance with the new rule  we will adopt statement no 
in the first quarter of we do not believe the effect of adopting statement no 
will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab no 

sab no 
requires analysis of misstatements using both an income statement rollover approach and a balance sheet iron curtain approach in assessing materiality and provides for a one time cumulative effect transition adjustment 
sab no 
is effective as of the beginning of fiscal years ending subsequent to november  the adoption of sab no 
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation fin no

fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty 
table of contents in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no

fin also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the provisions of fin are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt fin in the first quarter of we do not believe the effect of adoption fin will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
effect of inflation our results of operations and financial condition have not been significantly affected by general inflation 
we have reduced the effects of rising costs through improvements in productivity  cost containment programs and  where the competitive environment permits  increased selling prices 
however  changes in newsprint prices could have an impact on costs  which we may not be able to offset fully in our pricing or cost containment programs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest rates on our long term notes payable to banks  which are borrowings under our million unsecured revolving credit facility  and in prices for newsprint 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our net earnings and cash flows 
interest rates on our long term notes payable to banks are variable 
the interest rate on our current unsecured revolving credit facility is either at libor plus a margin that ranges from basis points to basis points  depending on our leverage  or the base rate  which equals the higher of the prime rate set by us bank  us or the federal funds rate plus basis points 
average interest rates on borrowings under our credit facility were in if interest rates had been basis points higher  our annual interest expense would have increased million  assuming comparable borrowing levels 
we have not entered into derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate risk 
we currently purchase approximately of our estimated newsprint requirements from two suppliers 
we pay market prices for quantities we determine will meet our requirements 
the remaining of our newsprint could come from these suppliers or from other suppliers in the spot market 
price fluctuations for newsprint can have a significant effect on our results of operations 
the average net price per ton was in based on the average net price per ton in and consumption of newsprint in  a per ton increase or decrease in the price of newsprint would increase or decrease our total cost of newsprint by million 
we have not entered into derivative instruments to manage our exposure to newsprint price risk
