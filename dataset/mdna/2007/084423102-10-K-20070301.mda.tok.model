item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further information regarding the increase in estimates for claims occurring in prior years 
a reconciliation between the reserves as of december  as reported in the accompanying consolidated gaap financial statements and those reported on the basis of statutory accounting principles sap is as follows amounts in thousands net reserves reported on a sap basis additions deductions to statutory reserves international property casualty reserves loss reserve discounting other net reserves reported on a gaap basis ceded reserves reclassified as assets gross reserves reported on a gaap basis for statutory purposes  we use a discount rate of for non proportional business as permitted by the department of insurance of the state of delaware 

table of contents the following table presents the development of net reserves for through the top line of the table shows the estimated reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years 
this represents the estimated amount of losses and loss expenses for claims arising in all prior years that are unpaid at the balance sheet date  including losses that had been incurred but not reported to us 
the upper portion of the table shows the re estimated amount of the previously recorded reserves based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year 
the estimate changes as more information becomes known about the frequency and severity of claims for individual years 
the cumulative redundancy deficiency represents the aggregate change in the estimates over all prior years 
for example  the reserves have developed a million redundancy over ten years 
that amount has been reflected in income over the ten years 
the impact on the results of operations of the past three years of changes in reserve estimates is shown in the reconciliation tables above 
it should be noted that the table presents a run off of balance sheet reserves  rather than accident or policy year loss development 
therefore  each amount in the table includes the effects of changes in reserves for all prior years 
for example  assume a claim that occurred in is reserved for  as of december  assuming this claim estimate was changed in to  and was settled for  in  the deficiency would appear as a deficiency in each year from through year ended december  amounts in millions net reserves  discounted reserve discount net reserve  undiscounted net re estimated as of one year later two years later three years later four years later five years later six years later seven years later eight years later nine years later ten years later cumulative redundancy deficiency  undiscounted cumulative amount of net liability paid through one year later two years later three years later four years later five years later six years later seven years later eight years later nine years later ten years later 
table of contents the following table presents the development of gross reserves for through year ended december  amounts in millions net reserves  discounted ceded reserves gross reserves  discounted reserve discount gross reserve undiscounted gross re estimated as of one year later two years later three years later four years later five years later six years later seven years later eight years later nine years later ten years later gross cumulative redundancy deficiency deficiency undiscounted reinsurance we follow a common industry practice of reinsuring a portion of our exposures and paying to reinsurers a part of the premiums received on the policies that we write 
reinsurance is purchased principally to reduce net liability on individual risks and to protect against catastrophic losses 
although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies  it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage 
we monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers and attempt to place our coverages only with substantial  financially sound carriers 
as a result  generally the reinsurers who reinsure our casualty insurance must have an am best rating of a excellent or better with at least million in policyholder surplus and the reinsurers who cover our property insurance must have an am best rating of a excellent or better with at least million in policyholder surplus 
regulation our insurance subsidiaries are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do business  and the company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with such regulations 
they are subject to statutes which delegate regulatory  supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance commissioners 
this regulation relates to such matters as the standards of solvency which must be met and maintained  the licensing of insurers and their agents  the nature of and limitations on investments  deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders  approval of certain policy forms and premium rates  periodic examination of the affairs of insurance companies  annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial condition of insurers or for other purposes  establishment and maintenance of reserves for unearned premiums and losses  and requirements regarding numerous other matters 
our property casualty subsidiaries  other than excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries  must generally file all rates with the insurance department of each state in which they operate 
our excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries generally operate free of rate and form regulation 
in addition to regulatory supervision of our insurance subsidiaries  we are subject to state statutes governing insurance holding company systems 
typically  such statutes require that we periodically file information with the appropriate state insurance commissioner  including information concerning our capital structure  ownership  
table of contents financial condition and general business operations 
under the terms of applicable state statutes  any person or entity desiring to purchase more than a specified percentage commonly of our outstanding voting securities would be required to obtain regulatory approval of the purchase 
under florida law  which is applicable to us due to our ownership of carolina casualty insurance company  a florida domiciled insurer  the acquisition of more than of our capital stock must receive regulatory approval 
further  state insurance statutes typically place limitations on the amount of dividends or other distributions payable by insurance companies in order to protect their solvency 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
various state and federal organizations  including congressional committees and the national association of insurance commissioners naic  have been conducting reviews into various aspects of the insurance business 
no assurance can be given that future legislative or regulatory changes resulting from such activity will not adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries 
the naic utilizes a risk based capital rbc formula that is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer s statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business 
the rbc formula develops a risk adjusted target level of adjusted statutory capital by applying certain factors to various asset  premium and reserve items 
the rbc model law provides for four incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the calculated rbc target 
these levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to actually placing the insurer under regulatory control 
the rbc of each of our domestic insurance subsidiaries was above the authorized rbc control level as of december  the gramm leach bliley act  or financial services modernization act of the act  was enacted in and significantly affects the financial services industry  including insurance companies  banks and securities firms 
the act modifies federal law to permit the creation of financial holding companies  which  as regulated by the act  can maintain cross holdings in insurance companies  banks and securities firms to an extent not previously allowed 
the act also permits or facilitates certain types of combinations or affiliations for financial holding companies 
the act establishes a functional regulatory scheme under which state insurance departments will maintain primary regulation over insurance activities  subject to provisions for certain federal preemptions 
our insurance company subsidiaries are also subject to assessment by state guaranty funds when an insurer in a particular jurisdiction has been judicially declared insolvent and insufficient funds are available from the liquidated company to pay policyholders and claimants 
the protection afforded under a state s guaranty fund to policyholders of the insolvent insurer varies from state to state 
generally  all licensed property casualty insurers are considered to be members of the fund  and assessments are based upon their pro rata share of direct written premiums 
the naic model post assessment guaranty fund act  which many states have adopted  limits assessments to an insurer to of its subject premium and permits recoupment of assessments through rate setting 
likewise  several states or underwriting organizations of which our insurance subsidiaries are required to be members have limited assessment authority with regard to deficits in certain lines of business 
we receive funds from our insurance company subsidiaries in the form of dividends and management fees for certain management services 
annual dividends in excess of maximum amounts prescribed by state statutes may not be paid without the approval of the insurance commissioner of the state in which an insurance subsidiary is domiciled 
the terrorism risk insurance act of became effective november  and was amended on december  by the terrorism risk insurance extension act of together  tria 
tria establishe a temporary federal program that provides for a system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism 
the program is scheduled to terminate on december  tria is applicable to almost all commercial lines of property and casualty insurance but excludes commercial auto  burglary and theft  surety  professional liability and farm owners multi peril insurance 
insurers with direct commercial property and casualty insurance exposure in the united states are required to participate in the program and make available coverage for certified acts of terrorism 
federal participation will be triggered under tria when the secretary of treasury certifies an act of terrorism 
under the program  the federal government will pay in of an insurer s covered losses in excess of the insurer s applicable deductible 
the insurer s deductible is based on a percent of earned premium for covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance for it will be 
table of contents of premium 
based on our earned premiums  our deductible under tria during will increase to approximately million 
as of  the federal program will not pay losses for certified acts unless such losses exceed million 
tria limits the federal government s share of losses at billion for a program year 
in addition  an insurer that has satisfied its deductible is not liable for the payment of losses in excess of the billion cap 
after december   there will not be a federal program available for terrorism losses unless tria is further extended or replaced 
at such time  the company will have the option to exclude terrorism losses from coverage  except for any lines of insurance or jurisdictions where exclusions are not permitted 
the insurance industry recently has become the subject of increasing scrutiny with respect to insurance broker and agent compensation arrangements and sales practices 
the new york state attorney general and other state and federal regulators have commenced investigations and other proceedings relating to compensation and bidding arrangements between producers and issuers of insurance products  and alleged unsuitable sales practices by producers on behalf of either the issuer or the purchaser 
the practices currently under investigation include  among other things  allegations that so called contingent commission arrangements may conflict with a broker s duties to its customers and that certain brokers and insurers may have engaged in anti competitive practices in connection with insurance premium quotes 
the new york state attorney general has entered into settlement agreements with several large insurance brokers and insurance companies 
these investigations and proceedings are expected to continue  and new investigative proceedings may be commenced  in the future 
these investigations and proceedings could result in legal precedents and new industry wide practices or legislation  rules or regulations that could significantly affect the insurance industry and the company 
following the public disclosure of the new york state attorney general s investigation  the company commenced an internal review with the assistance of outside counsel that focused on the company s relationships with its distribution channels 
as a result of its investigation  the company uncovered at a single insurance operating unit certain limited instances of conduct that could be characterized as involving inappropriate solicitation practices 
that operating unit has reached an agreement with its domiciliary insurance regulator resolving all issues pertaining to such regulator s inquiry without penalty 
competition the property casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses are competitive  with over  insurance companies transacting business in the united states 
we compete directly with a large number of these companies 
our strategy in this highly fragmented industry is to seek specialized areas or geographic regions where our insurance subsidiaries can gain a competitive advantage by responding quickly to changing market conditions 
our subsidiaries establish their own pricing practices 
such practices are based upon a company wide philosophy to price products with the intent of making an underwriting profit 
competition in the industry generally changes with profitability 
competition for specialty and alternative markets business comes from other specialty insurers  regional carriers  large national multi line companies and reinsurers 
under certain market conditions  standard carriers also compete for excess and surplus business 
competition for the reinsurance business comes from domestic and foreign reinsurers  which produce their business either on a direct basis or through the broker market 
these competitors include berkshire hathaway  swiss re  transatlantic reinsurance and everest reinsurance 
the regional property casualty subsidiaries compete with mutual and other regional stock companies as well as national carriers 
direct writers of property casualty insurance compete with the regional subsidiaries by writing insurance through their salaried employees  generally at a lower cost than through independent agents such as those used by the company 
the international operations compete with native insurance operations both large and small  which may be related to government entities  as well as with branch or local subsidiaries of multinational companies 
competition from bermuda and other tax advantaged jurisdictions has increased over the last several years  including from domestic based subsidiaries of foreign based entities 

table of contents employees as of february   we employed  persons 
of this number  our subsidiaries employed  persons  of whom  were executive and administrative personnel and  were clerical personnel 
we employed the remaining persons at the parent company and in investment operations  of whom were executive and administrative personnel and were clerical personnel 
other information about the company s business we maintain an interest in the acquisition or start up of complementary businesses and continue to evaluate possible acquisitions and new ventures on an ongoing basis 
in addition  our insurance subsidiaries develop new coverages or lines of business to meet the needs of insureds 
seasonal weather variations and other events affect the severity and frequency of losses sustained by the insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries 
although the effect on our business of such catastrophes as tornadoes  hurricanes  hailstorms  earthquakes and terrorist acts may be mitigated by reinsurance  they nevertheless can have a significant impact on the results of any one or more reporting periods 
we have no customer which accounts for percent or more of our consolidated revenues 
compliance by w

item a 
risk factors certain factors that may affect future results our business faces significant risks 
if any of the events or circumstances described as risks below actually occurs  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
risks relating to our industry our results may fluctuate as a result of many factors  including cyclical changes in the insurance and reinsurance industry 
the results of companies in the property casualty insurance industry historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties 
the demand for insurance is influenced primarily by general economic conditions  while the supply of insurance is directly related to available capacity 
the adequacy of premium rates is affected mainly by the severity and frequency of claims  which are influenced by many factors  including natural disasters  regulatory measures and court decisions that define and expand the extent of coverage and the effects of economic inflation on the amount of compensation due for injuries or losses 
in addition  investment rates of return may impact policy rates 
these factors can have a significant impact on ultimate profitability because a property casualty insurance policy is priced before its costs are known  as premiums usually are determined long before claims are reported 
these factors could produce results that would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims  which may require us to establish additional reserves 
our gross reserves for losses and loss expenses were approximately billion as of december  our loss reserves reflect our best estimates of the cost of settling all claims and related expenses with respect to insured events that have occurred 
reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability 
rather  reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claims administration will cost for claims that have occurred  whether known or unknown 
the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation 
these estimates  which generally involve actuarial projections  are based on management s assessment of facts and circumstances then known  as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency  inflation  judicial theories of liability  reinsurance coverage  legislative changes and other factors  including the actions of third parties which are beyond our control 
the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities  where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made and settlement is reached 
in periods with increased economic volatility  it becomes more difficult to accurately predict claim costs 
reserve estimates are continually refined in an ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled 
adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the periods in which such estimates are changed 
because setting reserves is inherently uncertain  we cannot assure that our current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events 
should we need to increase our reserves  our pre tax income for the period would decrease by a corresponding amount 
we increased our estimates for claims occurring in prior years by million in  million in and million in we  along with the property casualty insurance industry in general  have experienced higher than expected losses for certain types of business written from to although our reserves reflect our best estimate of the costs of settling claims  we cannot assure you that our claim estimates will not need to be increased in the future 
we discount our reserves for excess and assumed workers compensation business because of the long period of time over which losses are paid 
discounting is intended to appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment securities supporting liabilities 
the expected loss and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting is derived from our loss payout experience and is supplemented with data compiled from insurance companies writing similar business 
changes in the loss and loss expense payout pattern are recorded in the period they are determined 
if the actual loss payout pattern is shorter than anticipated  the discount will be reduced and pre tax income will decrease by a corresponding amount 
as a property casualty insurer  we face losses from natural and man made catastrophes 
property casualty insurers are subject to claims arising out of catastrophes that may have a significant effect on their results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
catastrophe losses have had a significant impact on our results 
in addition  through our recent quota share arrangements with certain lloyd s syndicates  we have additional exposure to catastrophic losses 
for example  weather related losses were million in  million in and million in catastrophes can be caused by various events  including hurricanes  windstorms  earthquakes  hailstorms  explosions  severe winter weather and fires  as well as terrorist activities 
the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable but have increased in recent years 
the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event 
some catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas  however  hurricanes and earthquakes may produce significant damage in large  heavily populated areas 
catastrophes can cause losses in a variety of our property casualty lines  and most of our past catastrophe related claims have resulted from severe storms 
seasonal weather variations may affect the severity and frequency of our losses 
insurance companies are not permitted to reserve for a catastrophe until it has occurred 
it is therefore possible that a catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events could produce significant losses and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents we face significant competitive pressures in our businesses  which may reduce premium rates and prevent us from pricing our products at attractive rates 
we compete with a large number of other companies in our selected lines of business 
we compete  and will continue to compete  with major us and non us insurers and reinsurers  other regional companies  as well as mutual companies  specialty insurance companies  underwriting agencies and diversified financial services companies 
competition in our businesses is based on many factors  including the perceived financial strength of the company  premium charges  other terms and conditions offered  services provided  commissions paid to producers  ratings assigned by independent rating agencies  speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in the lines to be written 
some of our competitors  particularly in the reinsurance business  have greater financial and marketing resources than we do 
these competitors within the reinsurance segment include berkshire hathaway  swiss re  transatlantic reinsurance and everest reinsurance company 
we expect that perceived financial strength  in particular  will become more important as customers seek high quality reinsurers 
certain of our competitors operate from tax advantaged or less regulated jurisdictions that may provide them with competitive advantages 
new competition could cause the supply and or demand for insurance or reinsurance to change  which could affect our ability to price our products at attractive rates 
we  as a primary insurer  may have significant exposure for terrorist acts 
to the extent an act of terrorism is certified by the secretary of treasury  we may be covered under the terrorism risk insurance act of  as amended on december  tria  for up to in in of our losses for certain property casualty lines of insurance 
however  any such coverage would be subject to a mandatory deductible based on a percent of earned premium for the covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance 
based on our earned premiums  our deductible under tria during will increase to approximately million which is a result of an increase in premium and an increase in the applicable deductible percentage from in to in in addition  even the coverage provided under tria is scheduled to terminate on december  unless extended or replaced by a similar program 
this coverage provided under tria does not apply to reinsurance that we write 
we are subject to extensive governmental regulation  which increases our costs and could restrict the conduct of our business 
we are subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision 
most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than stockholders and other investors 
this system of regulation  generally administered by a department of insurance in each state in which we do business  relates to  among other things standards of solvency  including risk based capital measurements  restrictions on the nature  quality and concentration of investments  requiring certain methods of accounting  rate and form regulation pertaining to certain of our insurance businesses  and potential assessments for the provision of funds necessary for the settlement of covered claims under certain policies provided by impaired  insolvent or failed insurance companies 
state insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of insurance companies  holding company issues and other matters 
recently adopted federal financial services modernization legislation may lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years 
also  foreign governments regulate our international operations 
the insurance industry recently has become the subject of increasing scrutiny with respect to insurance broker and agent compensation arrangements and sales practices 
the new york state attorney general and other state 
table of contents and federal regulators have commenced investigations and other proceedings relating to compensation and bidding arrangements between producers and issuers of insurance products  and alleged unsuitable sales practices by producers on behalf of either the issuer or the purchaser 
the practices currently under investigation include  among other things  allegations that contingent commission arrangements may conflict with a broker s duties to its customers and that certain brokers and insurers may have engaged in anti competitive practices in connection with insurance premium quotes 
the new york state attorney general has entered into settlement agreements with several large insurance brokers and insurance companies 
these investigations and proceedings are expected to continue  and new investigative proceedings may be commenced  in the future 
these investigations and proceedings could result in legal precedents and new industry wide practices or legislation  rules or regulations that could significantly affect the insurance industry and the company 
for example  following the public disclosure of the new york state attorney general s investigation  the company commenced an internal review with the assistance of outside counsel that focused on the company s relationships with its distribution channels 
as a result of its investigation  the company uncovered at a single insurance operating unit certain limited instances of conduct that could be characterized as involving inappropriate solicitation practices 
that operating unit has reached an agreement with its domiciliary insurance regulator resolving all issues pertaining to such regulator s inquiry without penalty 
we cannot assure you that regulators will not make further inquiries in the future 
we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority s interpretation of the laws and regulations 
also  some regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant  renew or revoke licenses and approvals 
if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements  the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or monetarily penalize us 
also  changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry  whether federal  state or foreign  or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities  restrict the conduct of our business 
in certain of our insurance businesses  the rates we charge our policyholders are subject to regulatory approval 
certain lines of business are subject to a greater degree of regulatory scrutiny then others 
for example  the workers compensation business is highly regulated 
during  approximately of our net premiums written represented primary workers compensation business 
of our net premiums written  approximately represented primary workers compensation business written in the state of california  where the impact of workers compensation reform has resulted in significant reductions 
risks relating to our business we cannot guarantee that our reinsurers will pay in a timely fashion  if at all  and  as a result  we could experience losses 
we purchase reinsurance by transferring part of the risk that we have assumed  known as ceding  to a reinsurance company in exchange for part of the premium we receive in connection with the risk 
although reinsurance makes the reinsurer liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the reinsurer  it does not relieve us  the reinsured  of our liability to our policyholders 
our reinsurers may not pay the reinsurance recoverables that they owe to us or they may not pay such recoverables on a timely basis 
accordingly  we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers  and if our reinsurers fail to pay us  our financial results would be adversely affected 
underwriting results and investment returns of some of our reinsurers may affect their future ability to pay claims 
as of december   the amount due from our reinsurers was million  including amounts due from state funds and industry pools 
certain of these amounts due from reinsurers are secured by letters of credit or by funds held in trust on our behalf 
we are rated by am best  standard poor s  and moody s  and a decline in these ratings could affect our standing in the insurance industry and cause our sales and earnings to decrease 
ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies 
certain of our insurance company subsidiaries are rated by am best  standard poor s and moody s investors services 
while am best  standard poor s and moody s ratings reflect their opinions as to a 
table of contents company s financial strength  operating performance  strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders  they are not evaluations directed to investors and are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold our securities 
our ratings are subject to periodic review  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain those ratings 
five of our insurance subsidiaries  admiral insurance company  nautilus insurance company  admiral indemnity company  great divide insurance company and clermont insurance company  have am best ratings of a superior  which is am best s second highest rating 
all of our other domestic insurance subsidiaries and w 
r 
berkley insurance europe  limited have am best ratings of a excellent  which is the third highest rating out of possible ratings by a 
m 
best 
the standard poor s financial strength rating for our domestic insurance subsidiaries is a the seventh highest rating out of twenty seven possible ratings 
our moody s rating is a for berkley insurance company the sixth highest rating out of twenty one possible ratings 
if our ratings are reduced from their current levels by am best  standard poor s or moody s  our competitive position in the insurance industry could suffer and it would be more difficult for us to market our products 
a significant downgrade could result in a substantial loss of business as policyholders move to other companies with higher claims paying and financial strength ratings 
if market conditions cause reinsurance to be more costly or unavailable  we may be required to bear increased risks or reduce the level of our underwriting commitments 
as part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy  we purchase reinsurance for certain amounts of risk underwritten by our insurance company subsidiaries  especially catastrophe risks 
we also purchase reinsurance on risks underwritten by others which we reinsure 
market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase  which may affect the level of our business and profitability 
our reinsurance facilities are generally subject to annual renewal 
we may be unable to maintain our current reinsurance facilities or to obtain other reinsurance facilities in adequate amounts and at favorable rates 
if we are unable to renew our expiring facilities or to obtain new reinsurance facilities  either our net exposures would increase or  if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net exposures  we would have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments  especially catastrophe exposed risks 
our international operations expose us to investment  political and economic risks 
our international operations expose us to investment  political and economic risks  including foreign currency and credit risk 
changes in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we may not find suitable acquisition candidates or new insurance ventures and even if we do  we may not successfully integrate any such acquired companies or successfully invest in such ventures 
as part of our present strategy  we continue to evaluate possible acquisition transactions and the start up of complementary businesses on an ongoing basis  and at any given time  we may be engaged in discussions with respect to possible acquisitions and new ventures 
we cannot assure that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition transactions or insurance ventures  that such transactions will be financed and completed on acceptable terms or that our future acquisitions or ventures will be successful 
the process of integrating any companies we do acquire or investing in new ventures may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees 
we depend on our ability to attract and retain experienced underwriting talent and other skilled employees who are knowledgeable about our business 
if the quality of our underwriting team and other personnel decreases  we may be unable to maintain our current competitive position in the specialized markets in which we operate  and be unable to expand our operations into new markets 

table of contents risks relating to our investments a significant amount of our assets is invested in fixed income securities and is subject to market fluctuations 
our investment portfolio consists substantially of fixed income securities 
as of december   our investment in fixed income securities was approximately billion  or of our total investment portfolio 
the fair market value of these assets and the investment income from these assets fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions 
the fair market value of fixed income securities generally decreases as interest rates rise 
conversely  if interest rates decline  investment income earned from future investments in fixed income securities will be lower 
in addition  some fixed income securities  such as mortgage backed and other asset backed securities  carry prepayment risk as a result of interest rate fluctuations 
based upon the composition and duration of our investment portfolio at december   a basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of our investments of approximately million 
the value of investments in fixed income securities  and particularly our investments in high yield securities  is subject to impairment as a result of deterioration in the credit worthiness of the issuer or increases in market interest rates

merger arbitrage differs from other types of investments in its focus on transactions and events believed likely to bring about a change in value over a relatively short time period  usually four months or less 
our merger arbitrage positions are exposed to the risk associated with the completion of announced deals  which are subject to regulatory as well as political and other risks 
if there is reduced activity in the merger and acquisitions area  we may not be able achieve the returns that we have enjoyed in the past
