overview in  we worked to realign our business focus to take advantage of two important trends in the telecommunication industry the convergence of landline  mobile  and internet communications 
the acceleration in the adoption of the on demand delivery model 
these trends continued to drive the need among service providers for flexible  faster to market  network independent software applications to compete against competitive threats 
in response  we moved to complement our direct to consumer business model with an on demand application model to provide communication solutions that require minimal allocation of capital and allow service providers to quickly react to customer needs and adapt to the dynamically shifting competitive landscape 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we provide application services on a subscription basis that add features and enhanced functionality to the telecommunications services used by mainstream consumers and small and home offices 
our software based services are delivered by our desktop phone companion software pcs through our proprietary enhanced services platform  which allows subscribers to manage calls across existing landline  mobile and internet networks 
as of june   we had approximately  paying subscribers for these application services 
because our services improve the utilization of existing telecommunications services by our subscribers  we believe that our application services complement the efforts of landline  mobile and internet service providers to reduce their subscriber churn 
this has allowed us to establish cooperative relationships with network service providers 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts  investments in minority owned companies  inventories  accounting for income taxes  loss contingencies  stock based compensation  and valuation of acquired intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting policies  estimates and assumptions with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed these disclosures 
revenue recognition 
we earn revenues primarily from paid subscriber services and to a lesser extent  fees earned from local exchange carrier call termination access charges and the offering of third party products and services to our subscribers 
we recognize revenue in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition  which clarifies certain existing accounting principles for the timing of revenue recognition and classification of revenues in the financial statements 
we recognize revenue beginning when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fees are fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
our subscriber revenues consist mainly of monthly recurring subscription fees 
we recognize revenue ratably over the subscription period when the sab criteria are met 
in addition to the direct relationship that we have with the majority of our paid subscribers  we also have indirect relationship agreements with internet service providers isps and other companies whereby those companies customers are offered a co branded subscription service 
when the agreement provides that we are the party responsible for providing the service  have control over the fees charged to customers and bear the credit risk  we record the gross amount billed as revenue in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  reporting revenues gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
when the agreement provides that we receive a net payment from our co branding partners based upon the number of their customers registered for our services  we record the net amount received as revenue in accordance with eitf in the third quarter of fiscal  we purchased prepaid phones and phone cards with the intention of reselling them with a day free trial of our application based services and entered into an agreement to sell the prepaid phones and a portion of the phone cards to a distributor 
revenue from the sale of prepaid phones and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements phone cards is recognized when the sab criteria are met 
we recognize sales to distributors on a sell through basis and when the cash is collected from the distributor and have recognized  and  of revenue related to the sales to this distributor in the years ended june  and these transactions contain multiple elements  including the phone  the minutes  and our callwave service  to which we have applied eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the various elements of the arrangement are separable and each element is recognized separately in accordance with sab in accounting for multiple deliverables  management s judgment is necessary when identifying the nature of deliverables in an arrangement as well as measuring and allocating fair value to the multiple deliverables 
this program was cancelled in the second quarter of fiscal and remaining inventories of approximately  were completely written off to expense 
allowances for doubtful accounts we record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our historical experience with bad debts 
we periodically review and evaluate bad debt reserves held by the local telephone companies and the third party that manages our billing relationship with the telephone companies 
judgment is required when we assess the realization of receivables  including assessing the probability of collection 
our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled  as of june  and  as of june  our allowance for doubtful accounts is correlated with our aggregate billings through the local telephone companies 
the decrease in the allowance is related to higher than expected carrier reject rates during the first half of fiscal investments in minority owned companies we account for investments in minority interests of other companies over which we do not exercise significant influence on the cost method in accordance with apb  the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
under the cost method  an investment is carried at cost until it is sold or there is evidence that changes in the business environment or other facts and circumstances suggest it may be other than temporarily impaired 
at september   we determined that our investment in a minority owned company was other than temporarily impaired and recorded an impairment loss in the amount of  to reduce the investment to a net realizable value of callwave has no other investments of this nature 
inventories inventories consist of finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value  cost being determined under the first in  first out method 
for the year ended june   we recorded an impairment against inventory in the amount of  to reduce the inventory balance to its expected net realizable value of zero 
management s judgment is required in determining net realizable value and the extent of any impairment to our inventory 
judgment is also required in determining the collectability of amounts that are due from our distributors as a result of selling our inventory through to end customers 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of the assets and liabilities 
at june   we had net deferred tax assets of million 
due to the uncertainty of realizing these net deferred tax assets  we have recorded a valuation allowance of million against these net deferred tax assets 
such uncertainty primarily relates to the potential for net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits which begin to expire in and  respectively  to be realized against future taxable income 
we will continue to assess the likelihood of realization of these assets 

table of contents 
index to financial statements loss contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss  in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the provision of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
under the fair value recognition provision of sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award 
we estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the black scholes merton option pricing model and a single option award approach 
the fair value is amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
determining the appropriate fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  forfeiture rates and expected term 
we compute expected volatility based on a combination of both historical volatility and market based implied volatility  as we believe that the combination provides a more accurate estimate of future volatility 
the expected term represents the period of time that our stock based awards are expected to be outstanding and is determined based on historical experience of similar awards 
due to the inherent uncertainty in valuing awards for publicly traded stock as of the grant date  given that such awards will be exercised  purchased or sold at indeterminate future dates  the actual value realized by the recipients  if any  may vary significantly from the value of the awards estimated by us at the grant date 
valuation of acquired intangible assets we have acquired intangible assets primarily via the acquisition of license agreements 
these license agreements give us the right to practice and use certain technologies in the fax  voice and internet telephony space 
these assets are accounted for under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires us to record these assets at their fair value 
historically  we have used the cash purchase price at the time of acquisition as the best indicator of fair value 
sfas no 
also requires us to periodically evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets to determine if an impairment loss should be recorded under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
in accordance with sfas no 
 an impairment loss shall be recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
sfas no 
outlines the factors which individually or in combination could trigger an impairment review as follows a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset asset group a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset asset group is being used or in its physical condition a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset asset group  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long lived asset asset group a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset asset group a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 

table of contents 
index to financial statements if we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we would measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the risk inherent in our business

results of operations comparison of fiscal years ended june  and revenues 
revenues were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
subscription revenues were million in fiscal  representing of revenues  compared to million in fiscal  representing of revenues  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in our revenues in fiscal was attributable primarily to a decrease in the number of paying subscribers from approximately  at june  to approximately  at june  the decrease in subscribers is driven primarily from the migration of dial up users to broad band 
in addition  our average revenue per user arpu decreased during fiscal as we have a higher percentage of our subscribers from our indirect channel distribution agreements 
we record revenue from our indirect channel partners on a gross or net basis depending on the facts of the agreement 
revenues from our indirect channel partners in fiscal year were million or of revenues compared to million or of revenues for the same period last year 
during the first quarter of the year ended june   we refined our assumptions for the amortization of deferred revenue and the associated costs 
the effect on revenue of refining these assumptions  which was treated as a change in estimate under us gaap  was a reduction in revenue of  these refined assumptions also reduced cost of sales by  and increased net loss by  or per share 
the change in estimate relates to more timely and accurate information made available by our third party billing provider 
cost of sales 
cost of sales was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
gross margins increased to for the year ended june  from for the year ended june  the decrease in cost of sales is primarily related to the decrease in the number of subscribers and a credit of  from one of our telecommunications carriers which we received in the nd quarter of fiscal the carrier was charging us for more lines than we had contracted to rent over an eleven month period beginning in january  the carrier agreed to credit our account for the overcharges and apply the credit to future bills 
as of june   the credit has been entirely utilized 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million  or of revenues  in fiscal  compared to million  or of revenues  in fiscal  an increase of million 
the increase as a percentage of total revenue is driven by the quarter over quarter decline in revenue as our direct to consumer dial up subscribers migrate to broadband services and we transition our business toward indirect channel distributors 
we also had increased marketing expenses as we promoted our direct to consumer free beta products through various ad based services 
we expect to incur higher marketing expenses in coming quarters as we continue to promote new products and new product features and enhancements in the direct to consumer and carrier channels 
we are committed to investing in our sales and marketing functions as we migrate a greater percentage of our business toward indirect channel distributors with landline and mobile operators while continuing to build product usage and add new subscribers in the direct to consumer channel 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million  or of revenues  in fiscal  compared to million  or of revenues  in fiscal  an increase of million

table of contents 
index to financial statements our business toward indirect channel distributors 
over the last six months we have launched seven new products and believe it is essential to have a strong research and development team as we continue to develop new products and add additional features and functionality in the direct channel and migrate our business toward indirect channel distribution arrangements with landline  mobile carriers and web portals  while continuing to strategically invest in the direct to consumer channel 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million  or of revenues in fiscal  compared to million  or of revenues  in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was due primarily to increased legal fees  payroll and related expenses  and stock based compensation charges 
legal fees related to the litigation with j global and catch curve were approximately  for the twelve months ended june  as a result of the settlement  these fees will not be recurring in future quarters 
impairment loss 
during the fiscal year ended june   we determined  based on an analysis of future cash flows  that our investment in and receivable from a company in which we had a minority interest was other than temporarily impaired 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment loss in the amount of  income tax provision 
we recognized an income tax provision for the twelve months ended june  of  no tax benefit was derived from the net loss recognized during the twelve months ended june  due to the valuation allowance established to offset our deferred tax assets 
total deferred tax assets amount to million and have been fully offset by a valuation allowance reflecting the fact that we have not determined that it is more likely than not that we will be able to use our deferred tax assets to reduce income taxes 
we will continue to assess the likelihood of realization of our net deferred tax assets and may adjust the balance in the future accordingly 
net loss 
the net loss was million for the year ended june   compared to net loss of million for the same period last year 
this net loss was primarily the result of reduced revenues as we shift our focus toward indirect distributor arrangements and our preparation for shifting our company into the indirect channel 
other contributing factors consisted of increased payroll and related costs  litigation fees  stock based compensation charges  and a change in estimate described under revenues above 
the net loss was reduced by the credit described in the cost of sales section above

cost of sales 
cost of sales was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
gross margins decreased to for the year ended june  from at june  the decrease in our gross margin is driven by increased wireline telecom costs to reserve phone numbers in preparation for our service platform rolling out with local exchange carriers  mobil operators and web portals 
wireline costs have also increased with the rollout of our new service platform which allows subscribers to screen  forward and transfer calls to mobile  landline or voip based phones 
these services 
table of contents 
index to financial statements generate increased minutes and numbers of calls compared to our traditional direct to consumer programs 
finally  cost of sales was negatively impacted by the discontinuation of our prepaid mobile phone program  the write off of the associated costs of  and the ongoing costs to support the limited users remaining on this service 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million  or of revenues  in fiscal  compared to million  or of revenues  in fiscal  a decrease of million 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses primarily relates to a million reduction in direct customer acquisition  advertising and promotional expenses as we migrate a greater percentage of our business toward indirect channel partnerships with landline and mobile operators and continue to strategically invest in the direct channel 
this expense reduction is partially offset with increased customer support expenses of approximately million 
the focus of our call center has shifted from technical support to landline customer retention and mobile sales and the related costs are now charged to sales and marketing 
previously  the call center performed a technical support role and its expenses were allocated across all three operating expense categories 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million  or of revenues  in fiscal  compared to million  or of revenues  in fiscal  a decrease of million

the increase in general and administrative expenses was due primarily to increased legal fees of million relating to ongoing litigation and higher bad debt expense of million associated with increased local exchange carrier reject fees 
other contributing factors were increased consulting expenses of million relating to indirect channel partnerships and increased facilities expenses of million associated with the consolidation of our facilities in california 
impairment loss 
during the fiscal year ended june   we determined  based on an analysis of future cash flows  that our investment in and receivable from a company in which we had a minority interest was other than temporarily impaired 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment loss in the amount of  income tax provision 
we recognized an income tax provision for the twelve months ended june  and an income tax benefit for the same period last year of million and million  respectively 
in prior periods we have recognized a tax benefit related to the reduction of the valuation allowance associated with deferred tax assets 
total deferred tax assets amount to million and have been fully offset by a valuation allowance reflecting the fact that we have not determined that it is more likely than not that we will be able to use our deferred tax assets to offset income taxes payable as we currently project eight quarters of losses due to investing in the indirect channel 
we will continue to assess the likelihood of realization of our net deferred tax assets and will adjust the balance accordingly 
net income loss 
the net loss was million for the year ended june   compared to net income of million for the same period last year  a decrease of million or 
this decrease in net income was primarily the result of reduced revenues as we shift our focus toward indirect partnerships  an increase in cost of sales related to our entry into the mobile phone market and preparing our company for the shift into the indirect channel  increased general and administrative expenses related to increased litigation and bad debt charges and a tax provision of million recorded during  an increase of million over the same period in during  our revenues decreased by million  cost of sales increased

table of contents 
index to financial statements liquidity and capital resources at june   our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents of million  marketable securities of million  and accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
since our initial public offering our working capital and capital expense requirements have been funded with cash flow provided from operations 
we believe our current cash reserves are adequate to cover anticipated losses over the next fiscal year as we migrate our business toward the indirect channel while continuing to strategically invest in our direct to consumer channel 
we do not expect to return to profitability until the first half of fiscal and we do not expect cash flow from operations to be positive in future periods until we return to profitability 
we reexamine our cash requirements periodically in light of changes in our business 
cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased from million at june  to million at june  this decrease is primarily due to settlement of the j and catch curve litigation for million  cash used in operating activities of million  and purchases of property and equipment of  partially offset by  from exercises of stock options 
a significant driver of the cash outflow from operating activities was legal fees of approximately million related to the litigation with j global and catch curve 
as a result of the settlement  these fees will not be recurring in future quarters 
reorganization in august of  we announced a reorganization and reduction in force and the termination of our chief executive officer 
as a result of the reorganization we will incur a one time charge of approximately million associated primarily with severance  health insurance  and accelerated stock option compensation expense 
the entire charge will be recognized in the first quarter of the fiscal year ended june  off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements 
franchise tax board audit in may  we were notified by the california franchise tax board that our research and development credits for the taxable year ended june   would be under examination 
as of the date of this filing  the examination is nearing completion 
the franchise tax board has recommended a reduction of our carryforward research credits by approximately  we intend to appeal the recommendation 
due to the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets  the reduction of the credit carryforward will not affect callwave s income tax provision  net loss  or net loss per share

table of contents 
index to financial statements purchase obligations consist primarily of contracts with communications services providers totaling  and contractual obligations to pay  to providers of billing and collection services and outsourced customer support due in less than one year 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk 
we do not currently do any business denominated in foreign currencies and  therefore  are not subject to any significant foreign currency exchange risk 
interest rate sensitivity 
we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million and marketable securities totaling million at june   and cash and cash equivalents totaling million and marketable securities totaling million at june  cash and cash equivalents were held for working capital purposes in depository accounts at fdic regulated banking institutions 
marketable securities consist of investment grade securities including auction rate securities  which carry interest or dividend rates that reset every seven to days  corporate bonds  and government and agency securities 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
due to our ability to liquidate these investments  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents or marketable securities as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  will reduce our future interest income 
if interest rates were to decline by as compared to the rates at june   our interest income would decrease approximately  on a quarterly basis based on the outstanding balance of our marketable securities and money market funds at june  a decline in market value of would reduce the value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities by approximately million
