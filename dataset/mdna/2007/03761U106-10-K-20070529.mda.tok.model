overview apollo investment was incorporated under the maryland general corporation law in february we have elected to be treated as a business development company under the investment company act of act 
as such  we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements 
for instance  we generally have to invest at least of our total assets in qualifying assets  including securities of private or thinly traded public us companies  cash equivalents  us government securities and high quality debt investments that mature in one year or less 
in addition  for federal income tax purposes we have elected to be treated as a ric under subchapter m of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
pursuant to this election and assuming we qualify as a ric  we generally do not have to pay corporate level federal income taxes on any income we distribute to our stockholders 
apollo investment commenced operations on april  upon completion of its initial public offering that raised million in net proceeds selling million shares of its common stock at a price of per share 
investments our level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors  including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle market companies  the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies  the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make 
over the last twenty four months  we believe that the availability of senior debt capital from banks for middle market companies has generally increased and has put downward pressure on interest rate spreads at the same time that base interest rates have risen 
we do not expect this increased availability of capital to impair our ability to make longer term investment allocations with our capital 
as a business development company  we must not acquire any assets other than qualifying assets specified in the act unless  at the time the acquisition is made  at least of our total assets are qualifying assets with certain limited exceptions 
qualifying assets include investments in eligible portfolio companies 
the sec recently adopted new rules under the act to expand the definition of eligible portfolio company to include all private companies and companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange 
the new rules also will permit us to include as qualifying assets certain follow on investments in companies that were eligible portfolio companies at the time of initial investment but that no longer meet the definition 
the new rules became effective november  due to this new rule  we will no longer be required to determine the eligibility of a portfolio company by reference to whether or not it has outstanding marginable securities 
in addition to the adoption of the rules described above  the sec also proposed for comment a rule that would include as eligible portfolio companies certain public companies that have listed their securities on a national securities exchange  as long as their public float and or market capitalization are below a specified level 
we will continue to monitor closely any developments with respect to the definition of eligible portfolio company  and intend to adjust our investment focus as needed to comply with and or take advantage of the new rules as well as any other regulatory  legislative  administrative or judicial actions in this area 
revenue we generate revenue primarily in the form of interest income from the debt securities we hold and capital gains  if any  on investment securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies 
our debt investments  whether in the form of mezzanine or senior secured loans  generally have a stated term of five to ten years and bear interest at a fixed rate or a floating rate usually determined on the basis of a benchmark libor  euribor  gbp libor  or the prime rate 
while us subordinated debt and corporate notes typically accrue interest at fixed rates  some of these investments may include zero coupon  payment in kind pik and or step up bonds that accrue income on a constant yield to call or maturity basis 
interest on debt securities is generally payable quarterly or semiannually 
in some cases  some of our investments provide for deferred interest payments or pik 
the principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid interest generally becomes due at the maturity date 
in addition  we may generate revenue in the form of dividends paid to us on equity investments as well as revenue in the form of commitment  origination  structuring and or diligence fees  fees for providing managerial assistance and  if applicable  consulting fees  etc 

table of contents expenses all investment professionals of the investment adviser and their staff  when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services to us  and the compensation and routine overhead expenses of that personnel which is allocable to those services are provided and paid for by aim 
we bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions  including those relating to investment advisory and management fees  expenses incurred by apollo investment management payable to third parties  including agents  consultants or other advisors  in monitoring our financial and legal affairs and in monitoring our investments and performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies  calculation of our net asset value including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firm  direct costs and expenses of administration  including auditor and legal costs  costs of preparing and filing reports or other documents with the sec  interest payable on debt  if any  incurred to finance our investments  offerings of our common stock and other securities  registration and listing fees  fees payable to third parties  including agents  consultants or other advisors  relating to  or associated with  evaluating and making investments  transfer agent and custodial fees  taxes  independent directors fees and expenses  marketing and distribution related expenses  the costs of any reports  proxy statements or other notices to stockholders  including printing and postage costs  our allocable portion of the fidelity bond  directors and officers errors and omissions liability insurance  and any other insurance premiums  organization and offering  and all other expenses incurred by us or apollo administration in connection with administering our business  such as our allocable portion of overhead under the administration agreement  including rent and our allocable portion of the cost of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs 
we expect our general and administrative operating expenses related to our ongoing operations to remain generally stable or increase moderately in dollar terms  but decline slightly as a percentage of our total assets in future periods 
incentive fees  interest expense and costs relating to future offerings of securities  among others  would be additive 
portfolio and investment activity during our fiscal year ended march   we invested billion  across new and several existing portfolio companies 
this compares to investing billion in new and several existing portfolio companies for the previous fiscal year ended march  investments sold or prepaid during the fiscal year ended march  totaled million versus million for the fiscal year ended march  at march   our net portfolio consisted of portfolio companies and was invested in subordinated debt  in preferred equity  in common equity and warrants and in senior secured loans versus portfolio companies invested in subordinated debt  in preferred equity  in common equity and in senior secured loans at march  the weighted average yields on our subordinated debt portfolio  senior secured loan portfolio and total debt portfolio were  and  respectively  at march  at march   the yields were   and  respectively 

table of contents senior secured loans and european mezzanine loans typically accrue interest at variable rates determined on the basis of a benchmark libor  euribor  gbp libor  or the prime rate  with stated maturities at origination that typically range from to years 
while subordinated debt issued within the united states will typically accrue interest at fixed rates  some of these investments may include zero coupon  pik and or step bonds that accrue income on a constant yield to call or maturity basis 
at march   or  million of our interest bearing portfolio is fixed rate debt and or million is floating rate debt 
at march   or million of our interest bearing portfolio was fixed rate debt and or million was floating rate debt 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
changes in the economic environment  financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ materially 
in addition to the discussion below  our critical accounting policies are further described in the notes to the financial statements 
valuation of portfolio investments as a business development company  we generally invest in illiquid securities including debt and equity securities of middle market companies 
under procedures established by our board of directors  we value investments  including certain subordinated debt  senior secured debt and other debt securities with maturities greater than days  for which market quotations are readily available  at such market quotations 
we obtain these market quotations from independent pricing services or use the mean between the bid and ask prices obtained from at least two brokers or dealers if available  otherwise by a principal market maker or a primary market dealer 
debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our board of directors 
such determination of fair values may involve subjective judgments and estimates 
investments purchased within days of maturity are valued at cost plus accreted discount  or minus amortized premium  which approximates value 
with respect to unquoted securities  our board of directors  together with our independent valuation advisers value each investment considering  among other measures  discounted cash flow models  comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public and other factors 
when an external event such as a purchase transaction  public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs  our board  together with our independent valuation advisers consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate and or assist us in our valuation 
because we expect that there will not be a readily available market for many of the investments in our portfolio  we expect to value many of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our board of directors using a documented valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process 
due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value  the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments  and the differences could be material 
with respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available  our board of directors has approved a multi step valuation process each quarter  as described below our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment  preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with our senior management  independent valuation firms engaged by our board of directors conduct independent appraisals and review management s preliminary valuations and their own independent assessment  the audit committee of our board of directors reviews the preliminary valuation of our investment adviser and that of the independent valuation firms and responds and supplements the valuation recommendation of the independent valuation firm to reflect any comments  and the board of directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith based on the input of our investment adviser  the respective independent valuation firms and the audit committee 
in september   the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  fair value measurements  which clarifies the definition of fair value and requires companies to expand their 
table of contents disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities in interim and annual periods subsequent to initial recognition 
adoption of sfas requires the use of the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
at this time  the company is in the process of reviewing the standard against its current valuation policies to determine future applicability 
revenue recognition we record interest income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts 
for loans and debt securities with contractual pik interest  which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the loan balance that generally becomes due at maturity  we will generally not accrue pik interest if the portfolio company valuation indicates that the pik interest is not collectible 
we do not accrue as a receivable interest on loans and debt securities if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such interest 
loan origination fees  original issue discount  and market discount are capitalized and then we amortize such amounts as interest income 
upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security  any unamortized loan origination fees are recorded as interest income 
we record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income when we receive such amounts 
net realized gains or losses and net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation we measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment  without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized  but considering unamortized upfront fees and prepayment penalties 
net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period  including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation  when gains or losses are realized 
within the context of these critical accounting policies  we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 
results of operations results comparisons are for the fiscal years ended march   march  and for the period april  commencement of operations through march  investment income for the fiscal years ended march   march  and for the period april  commencement of operations through march   gross investment income totaled million  million and million  respectively 
our significantly lower gross investment income for the period april  commencement of operations through march  reflects income earned primarily from short term us government securities and other temporary investments held during the ramp up period of our portfolio since our initial public offering 
the continued increase in gross investment income for fiscal years and was primarily due to the growth of our investment portfolio as compared to previous fiscal periods 
origination  closing and or commitment fees associated with investments in portfolio companies are accreted into interest income over the respective terms of the applicable loans

in the future  the company may raise additional equity or debt capital off its shelf registration or may securitize a portion of its investments 
the company may also further access million of additional credit commitments available to it under the terms of its existing credit facility and as the company s equity capital base grows 
the primary use of funds will be investments in portfolio companies  cash distributions to our shareholders and for other general corporate purposes 
payments due by period dollars in millions total less than year years years more than years senior secured revolving credit facility at march    million remained unused under our senior secured revolving credit facility 

table of contents contractual obligations we have entered into two contracts under which we have future commitments the investment advisory and management agreement  pursuant to which apollo investment management has agreed to serve as our investment adviser  and the administration agreement  pursuant to which apollo administration has agreed to furnish us with the facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct our day to day operations and provide on our behalf managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which we are required to provide such assistance 
payments under the investment advisory and management agreement are equal to a percentage of the value of our gross assets and a two part incentive fee 
payments under the administration agreement are equal to an amount based upon our allocable portion of apollo administration s overhead in performing its obligations under the administration agreement  including rent  technology systems  insurance and our allocable portion of the costs of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs 
either party may terminate each of the investment advisory and management agreement and administration agreement without penalty upon not more than days written notice to the other 
please see note within our financial statements for more information

in connection with the transaction  the company also committed to million of additional delay draw commitments under the term loans subject to various contingencies and draw down tests 
at march   we did not have any additional off balance sheet liabilities or other contractual obligations that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  other than the investment advisory and management agreement and the administration agreement described above 
dividends dividends paid to stockholders for the fiscal years ended march   and for the period april  commencement of operations through march  totaled million or per share  million or per share  and million or per share  respectively 
the following table summarizes our quarterly dividends paid to shareholders for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively declared dividends fiscal year ending march  fourth fiscal quarter third fiscal quarter second fiscal quarter first fiscal quarter fiscal year ending march  fourth fiscal quarter third fiscal quarter second fiscal quarter first fiscal quarter fiscal year ending march  fourth fiscal quarter third fiscal quarter second fiscal quarter first fiscal quarter period from april  to june  tax characteristics of all dividends will be reported to shareholders on form after the end of the calendar year 
we intend to continue to distribute quarterly dividends to our stockholders 
our quarterly dividends  if any  will be determined by our board of directors 
we have elected to be taxed as a ric under subchapter m of the internal revenue code of to maintain our ric status  we must distribute at least of our ordinary income and realized net short term capital gains in excess of realized net long term capital losses  if any  out of the assets legally available for distribution 
in addition  although we currently intend to distribute realized net capital gains ie  net long term capital gains in excess of short term capital losses  if any  at 
table of contents least annually  out of the assets legally available for such distributions  we may in the future decide to retain such capital gains for investment 
in such event  the consequences of our retention of net capital gains are as described under material us federal income tax considerations 
we maintain an opt out dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders 
as a result  if we declare a dividend  then stockholders cash dividends will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock  unless they specifically opt out of the dividend reinvestment plan so as to receive cash dividends 
see dividend reinvestment plan 
we may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make dividends and distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these dividends and distributions from time to time 
in addition  we may be limited in our ability to make dividends and distributions due to the asset coverage test for borrowings when applicable to us as a business development company under the act and due to provisions in future credit facilities 
if we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually  we will suffer adverse tax consequences  including possible loss of our ric status 
we cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any dividends and distributions or dividends and distributions at a particular level 
with respect to the dividends paid to shareholders  income from origination  structuring  closing  commitment and other upfront fees associated with investments in portfolio companies is treated as taxable income and accordingly  distributed to shareholders 
for the fiscal years ended march  and  upfront fees totaling million and million  respectively  are being amortized into income over the lives of their respective loans 
for the period from april  commencement of operations through march   upfront fees totaling million are being amortized into income over the lives of their respective loans 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
during the fiscal year ended march   many of the loans in our portfolio had floating interest rates 
these loans are usually based on a floating libo rate and typically have durations of one to six months after which they reset to current market interest rates 
as the percentage of our mezzanine and other subordinated loans increase as a percentage of our total investments  we expect that more of the loans in our portfolio will have fixed rates 
accordingly  we may hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures  options and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the act 
while hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates  they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments 
during the fiscal year ended march   we did not engage in interest rate hedging activities
