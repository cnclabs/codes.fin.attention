in the forest merger  mariner issued  shares of common stock to the shareholders of forest energy resources  inc our acquisition of forest energy resources added approximately bcfe of estimated proved reserves 
our revenues  profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and gas and our ability to find  develop and acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable while controlling and reducing costs 
the energy markets have historically been very volatile 
commodity prices are currently at or near historical highs and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
although we attempt to mitigate the impact of price declines and provide for more predictable cash flows through our hedging strategy  a substantial or extended decline in oil and natural gas prices or poor drilling results could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  cash flows  quantities of natural gas and oil reserves that we can economically produce and our access to capital 
conversely  the use of derivative instruments also can prevent us from realizing the full benefit of upward price movements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of mariner s financial condition and results of operations are based upon financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make 
table of contents estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our financial statements 
we analyze our estimates  including those related to oil and gas revenues  oil and gas properties  fair value of derivative instruments  goodwill  asset retirement obligations  income taxes and contingencies and litigation  and base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements oil and gas properties our oil and gas properties are accounted for using the full cost method of accounting 
all direct costs and certain indirect costs associated with the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized 
amortization of oil and gas properties is provided using the unit of production method based on estimated proved oil and gas reserves 
no gains or losses are recognized upon the sale or disposition of oil and gas properties unless the sale or disposition represents a significant quantity of oil and gas reserves  which would have a significant impact on the depreciation  depletion and amortization rate 
at the end of each quarter  a full cost ceiling limitation calculation is made whereby net capitalized costs related to proved and unproved properties less related deferred income taxes may not exceed an amount equal to the present value discounted at ten percent of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties less estimated future production and development costs and related income tax expense 
the full cost ceiling limitation is calculated using natural gas and oil prices in effect as of the balance sheet date and adjusted for basis or location differential  held constant over the life of the reserves 
we use derivative financial instruments that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting under sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  to hedge against the volatility of natural gas prices and  in accordance with sec guidelines  we include estimated future cash flows from our hedging program in our ceiling test calculation 
if net capitalized costs related to proved properties less related deferred income taxes were to exceed this limit  the excess would be charged to expense 
additional guidance was provided in staff accounting bulletin no 
 topic d c  primarily regarding the use of cash flow hedges  asset retirement obligations  and the effect of subsequent events on the ceiling test calculation 
once incurred  a write down is not reversible at a later date 
proved reserves our most significant financial estimates are based on estimates of proved natural gas and oil reserves 
estimates of proved reserves are key components in determining our rate for recording depreciation  depletion and amortization and our full cost ceiling limitation 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future revenues  rates of production and timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond our control 
the estimation process relies on assumptions and interpretations of available geologic  geophysical  engineering and production data  and the accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of the quality and quantity of available data 
our reserves are fully engineered on an annual basis by ryder scott company 
unproved properties the costs associated with unevaluated properties and properties under development are not initially included in the full cost amortization base and relate to unproved leasehold acreage  seismic data  wells and production facilities in progress and wells pending determination together with interest costs capitalized for these projects 
unevaluated leasehold costs are transferred to the amortization base once determination has been made or upon expiration of a lease 
geological and geophysical costs  including d seismic data costs  are included in the full cost amortization base as incurred when such costs cannot be associated with specific unevaluated properties for which we own a direct interest 
seismic data costs are associated with specific unevaluated properties if the seismic data is acquired for the purpose of evaluating acreage or trends covered by a leasehold interest owned by us 
we make this determination based on an analysis of leasehold and 
table of contents seismic maps and discussions with our chief exploration officer 
geological and geophysical costs included in unproved properties are transferred to the full cost amortization base along with the associated leasehold costs on a specific project basis 
costs associated with wells in progress and wells pending determination are transferred to the amortization base once a determination is made whether or not proved reserves can be assigned to the property 
costs of dry holes are transferred to the amortization base immediately upon determination that the well is unsuccessful 
all items included in our unevaluated property balance are assessed on a quarterly basis for possible impairment or reduction in value 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired net of the fair value of liabilities assumed in the acquisition 
we account for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires an annual impairment assessment and a more frequent assessment if certain events occur that indicate impairment may have occurred 
we performed the goodwill impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of the initial impairment assessment compares mariner s net book value to its estimated fair value 
if impairment is indicated  then mariner is required to make estimates of the fair value of goodwill 
the estimated fair value of goodwill is based on many factors  including future net cash flows of estimated proved reserves as well as the success of future exploration and development of unproved reserves 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value  then a measurement of the loss is performed with any excess charged to expense 
to date  no impairment to goodwill has been recorded 
income taxes our provision for taxes includes both state and federal taxes 
mariner records its federal income taxes using an asset and liability approach which results in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more likely than not to be recovered 
we apply significant judgment in evaluating our tax positions and estimating our provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could differ significantly from these estimates  which could impact our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
additionally  in may  the state of texas enacted substantial changes to its tax structure beginning in by implementing a new margin tax of to be imposed on revenues less certain costs  as specified in the legislation 
abandonment liability sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  addresses accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
sfas no 
was adopted on january  sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset s retirement obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the liability is accreted to its then present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
if the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount  a gain or loss is recognized 
to estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation  we employ a present value technique  which reflects certain assumptions  including our credit adjusted  risk free interest rate  the estimated settlement date 
table of contents of the liability and the estimated current cost to settle the liability 
changes in timing or to the original estimate of cash flows will result in changes to the carrying amount of the liability 
hedging program we use derivative instruments in the form of natural gas and crude oil price swap agreements and costless collar arrangements in order to manage price risk associated with future crude oil and natural gas production and fixed price crude oil and natural gas purchase and sale commitments 
such agreements are accounted for as hedges using the deferral method of accounting 
gains and losses resulting from these transactions  recorded at market value  are deferred and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci as appropriate  until recognized as operating income in mariner s statement of operations as the physical production hedged by the contracts is delivered 
we are required to assess the effectiveness of all our derivative contracts at inception and at least every three months 
if open contracts cease to qualify for hedge accounting  mark to market accounting is utilized and changes in the fair value of open contracts are recognized in the income statement 
loss of hedge accounting may cause volatility in earnings 
fair value is assessed  and measured and estimated by obtaining independent market quotes from counterparties and risk free interest rate and estimated volatility factors 
in addition  forward price curves and estimates of future volatility factors are used to assess and measure the effectiveness of our open contracts at the end of each period 
the fair values we report in our financial statements change as estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions or other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
the net cash flows related to any recognized gains or losses associated with these hedges are reported as oil and gas revenues and presented in cash flows from operations 
if the hedge is terminated prior to expected maturity  gains or losses are deferred and included in income in the same period as the physical production hedged by the contracts is delivered 
the conditions to be met for a derivative instrument to qualify as a cash flow hedge are the following i the item to be hedged exposes mariner to price risk  ii the derivative reduces the risk exposure and is designated as a hedge at the time the derivative contract is entered into  and iii at the inception of the hedge and throughout the hedge period there is a high correlation of changes in the market value of the derivative instrument and the fair value of the underlying item being hedged 
when the designated item associated with a derivative instrument matures  is sold  extinguished or terminated  derivative gains or losses are recognized as part of the gain or loss on sale or settlement of the underlying item 
when a derivative instrument is associated with an anticipated transaction that is no longer expected to occur or if correlation no longer exists  the gain or loss on the derivative is recognized in income to the extent the future results have not been offset by the effects of price or interest rate changes on the hedged item since the inception of the hedge 
revenue recognition our natural gas  crude oil and ngl revenues are recorded using the entitlement method 
under the entitlement method  revenue is recorded when title passes based on mariner s net interest or nominated deliveries 
mariner records its entitled share of revenues based on entitled volumes and contracted sales prices 
the sales price for natural gas  crude oil and ngls are adjusted for transportation cost and other related deductions 
the transportation costs and other deductions are based on contractual or historical data and do not require significant judgment 
subsequently  these deductions and transportation costs are adjusted to reflect actual charges based on third party documents 
historically  these adjustments have been insignificant 
since there is a ready market for natural gas  crude oil and ngls  mariner sells the majority of its products soon after production at various locations at which time title and risk of loss pass to the buyer 
as a result  mariner maintains a minimum amount of product inventory in storage 
gas imbalances occur when mariner sells more or less than its entitled ownership percentage of total gas production 
any amount received in excess overproduction of mariner s share is treated as a liability 
if mariner receives less than it is entitled  the underproduction is recorded as a receivable 
imbalances are reduced either by subsequent recoupment of 
table of contents over and under deliveries or by cash settlement  as required by applicable contracts 
production imbalances are marked to market at the end of each month at the lowest of i the price in effect at the time of production  ii the current market price  or iii the contract price  if a contract is in hand 
mariner s gas balancing assets and liabilities are not material  as oil and gas volumes sold are not significantly different from its share of production 
stock compensation expense we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  share based payment 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock based awards on the grant date which requires judgment in estimating the expected life of the option and the expected volatility of our stock 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates  and these differences could materially impact our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition to the critical estimates discussed above  estimates are used in accounting and computing depreciation  depletion and amortization  the full cost ceiling  accruals of operating costs and production revenues 
reclassifications and use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements some amounts from the previous years have been reclassified to conform to the presentation of financial statements 
these reclassifications do not affect net income 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
principles of consolidation our consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
all significant inter company balances and transactions have been eliminated 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation 
eitf requires that companies disclose the gross amounts of taxes reported 
the consensus is effective for interim or annual reporting periods beginning after december  adoption of this guidance did not materially impact our financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin no 
clarifies sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and requires that realization on an uncertain income tax position must be more likely than not ie greater than a percent likelihood of receiving a benefit before it can be recognized in the financial statements 
further  fin no 
prescribes the benefit to be recorded in the financial statements as the amount most likely to be realized assuming a review by tax authorities having all relevant information and applying current conventions 
fin no 
also clarifies the financial statement classification of tax related penalties and interest and sets forth new disclosures regarding unrecognized tax benefits 
fin no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and we will be required to adopt this interpretation in the first quarter of based on our evaluation as of december   we do not believe that fin no 
will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
sfas no 

table of contents does not require any new fair value measurements but rather it eliminates inconsistencies in the guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  earlier adoption is encouraged  provided the company has not yet issued financial statements  including for interim periods  for that fiscal year 
although we are still evaluating the potential effects of this standard  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operation  or cash flows 
in september  the securities and exchange commission released staff accounting bulletin no 
 quantifying financial statement misstatements sab 
sab gives guidance on how errors  built up over time in the balance sheet  should be considered from a materiality perspective and corrected 
sab provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
sab represents the sec staff s views on the proper interpretation of existing rules and as such has no effective date 
adoption of this guidance did not materially impact our financial statements 
during february  fasb issued sfas no  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas no 
which permits all entities to choose  at specified election dates  to measure eligible items at fair value 
sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value  and thereby mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
this statement also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after november  we are evaluating the impact that this standard will have on our financial statements

swordfish recommenced production in the fourth quarter of  rigel recommenced production in the first quarter of  and ochre and pluto recommenced production in the third quarter of increased development drilling at our aldwell unit in west texas contributed to a increase in onshore production to an average of approximately mmcfe per day in from an average of approximately mmcfe per day in in the deepwater gulf of mexico  production decreased approximately to an average of approximately mmcfe per day in compared to an average of approximately mmcfe per day in the decrease was largely due to reduced production at our black widow  yosemite and pluto fields 
pluto was shut in in april pending drilling of the new mississippi canyon well and installation of an extension to the existing subsea facilities 
production at black widow and yosemite was negatively impacted by hurricane activity as well as by expected declines 
as previously discussed  hurricane related delays in commencement of production at our swordfish  pluto and rigel development projects also contributed to the production decline 
in the gulf of mexico shelf  production decreased by approximately to an average of approximately mmcfe per day in from an average of approximately mmcfe per day in about mmcfe per day of the decrease is attributable to our ochre field  which remains shut in due to the effects of hurricane ivan in september and hurricanes katrina and rita in production from three new shelf discoveries green pepper  royal flush  and dice and production from the acquisition of interests in five offshore fields offset normal declines at our other gulf of mexico shelf fields and the impact of the hurricane season 
hedging activities in decreased our average realized natural gas price received by per mcf and revenues by million  compared with a decrease of per mcf and revenues of million in our hedging activities with respect to crude oil during decreased the average sales price received by per barrel and revenues by million compared with a decrease of per barrel and revenues of million for oil and gas revenues decreased to million in when compared to oil and gas revenues of million  due to the aforementioned decrease in production  partially offset by an increase in realized prices including the effects of hedging to per mcfe in from per mcfe in other revenues of million in represent an indemnity payment of million received from our former stockholder related to the merger and million generated by our west texas aldwell unit gathering system 
lease operating expense increased to million in from million in the increased costs were primarily attributable to the addition of new producing wells at our aldwell unit offset by reduced costs on our black widow  king kong yosemite  and pluto deepwater fields 
on a per unit basis  lease operating expenses were per mcfe in compared to per mcfe in the increased per unit costs also reflect lower production rates in  including hurricane related disruptions 
severance and ad valorem taxes were million and million for and  respectively 
the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in west texas property values for ad valorem taxes 
for and  severance and ad valorem taxes were and per mcfe  respectively 

table of contents transportation expense was million or per mcfe in  compared to million or per mcfe in the reduction is primarily attributable to our deepwater fields and includes reductions caused by the filing of new and higher transportation allowances with the mms on two of our deepwater fields for purpose of royalty calculation 
dd a expense decreased to million during from million for as a result of decreased production of bcfe in compared to  partially offset by an increase in the unit of production depreciation  depletion and amortization rate to per mcfe for from per mcfe for the per unit increase was primarily the result of an increase in future development costs on our deepwater development fields 
g a expense  which is net of million and million of overhead reimbursements billed or received from other working interest owners in and  respectively  increased to million during compared to million in the increase was primarily due to recognizing million in stock compensation expense related to restricted stock and options granted in we also paid million to our former stockholders to terminate a services agreement in  compared to million under the same agreement in in addition  g a expenses increased by million due to a reduction in the amount of g a capitalized  million in compared to million in impairment of production equipment held for use reflects the reduction of the carrying cost of our inventory by million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
in  the reduction in estimated value primarily related to subsea trees and wellhead equipment held in inventory 
net interest expense for increased to million from million in  primarily due to higher average debt levels in compared to in connection with the merger on march   mariner incurred million in new bank debt and issued a million promissory note to jedi 
for comparison purposes  approximately ten months of interest related to such borrowings is reflected in compared to twelve months of interest in capitalized interest increased from million in to million in income before income taxes decreased to million for compared to million for  attributable primarily to the decrease in oil and gas revenues resulting from the decreased production and increased g a expenses  both as noted above 
offsetting these factors were the receipt of other income related to the indemnity payment and lower dd a and transportation expenses 
provision for income taxes decreased to million for from million for as a result of decreased operating income for compared to liquidity and capital resources uses of capital 
our primary needs for liquidity during were as follows funding capital expenditures excluding hurricane repairs and acquisitions of approximately million  funding hurricane repairs and hurricane related abandonment expenditures of approximately million  financing the west cameron preferential right acquisition of approximately million  refinancing of approximately million of debt assumed in connection with our acquisition of forest s gulf of mexico operations  paying debt service obligations of approximately million  and paying routine operating and administrative expenses

hurricane expenditures 
during  we had incurred approximately million in hurricane expenditures resulting from hurricanes katrina and rita  of which million were repairs and million were hurricane related abandonment costs 
substantially all of the costs incurred pertained to the gulf of mexico assets acquired from forest 
sources of liquidity 
our primary sources of liquidity during were as follows cash flow from operations  increase in borrowings under our bank credit facility discussed below  and issuance of million of senior notes due discussed below 
bank credit facility mariner is party to a revolving line of credit with a syndicate of banks led by union bank of california  na and bnp paribas 
the bank credit facility  which is secured by substantially all of our assets  provides up to million of revolving borrowing capacity  including a million subfacility for letters of credit  subject to a borrowing base  and a million dedicated letter of credit 
the borrowing base is based upon the evaluation by the lenders of the company s oil and gas reserves and other factors 
effective march   the borrowing base was reaffirmed at million 
any increase in the borrowing base requires the consent of all lenders 
the bank credit facility will mature on march   and the letter of credit will mature on march  the letter of credit was used to obtain a letter of credit in favor of forest to secure mariner s performance of its obligations to drill and complete wells under an existing drill to earn program and is not included as a use of the borrowing base 
this letter of credit reduces periodically by an amount equal to the product of million times the number of wells exceeding that are drilled and completed 
as of january  the letter of credit had been reduced by approximately million based upon the wells drilled and completed as of december  we expect additional reductions based upon quarterly drilling activity  with the next reduction anticipated in april the letter of credit balance as of december  was million 
at december   mariner had approximately million in advances outstanding under the bank credit facility and four available letters of credit totaling million  of which million is required for plugging and abandonment obligations at certain of its offshore fields 
the outstanding principal balance of loans under the bank credit facility may not exceed the borrowing base 
if the borrowing base falls 
table of contents below the outstanding balance under the bank credit facility  mariner will be required to repay the deficit  pledge additional unencumbered collateral  cash collateralize certain letters of credit  or effect some combination of such repayment  pledge and collateralization 
the bank credit facility contains various restrictive covenants and other usual and customary terms and conditions  including limitations on the payment of cash dividends and other restricted payments  the incurrence of additional debt  the sale of assets  and speculative hedging 
the bank credit facility requires mariner to  among other things maintain a ratio of consolidated current assets plus the unused borrowing base to consolidated current liabilities of not less than to  and maintain a ratio of total debt to ebitda  as defined in the credit agreement  of not more than to mariner was in compliance with the financial covenants under the bank credit facility as of december  senior notes due during  mariner sold and issued to eligible purchasers million aggregate principal amount of its senior notes due the notes 
the notes were priced to yield to maturity 
net proceeds  after deducting initial purchasers discounts and commissions and offering expenses  were approximately million 
mariner used the net proceeds of the offering to repay debt under the bank credit facility 
the notes are senior unsecured obligations of mariner  rank senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness  rank equally in right of payment with mariner s existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and are effectively subordinated in right of payment to mariner s senior secured indebtedness  including its obligations under its bank credit facility  to the extent of the collateral securing such indebtedness  and to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of any non guarantor subsidiaries 
the notes are jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by mariner s existing and future domestic subsidiaries 
in the future  the guarantees may be released or terminated under certain circumstances 
each subsidiary guarantee ranks senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness of the guarantor subsidiary  ranks equally in right of payment to all existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness of the guarantor subsidiary and effectively subordinate to all existing and future secured indebtedness of the guarantor subsidiary  including its guarantees of indebtedness under mariner s bank credit facility  to the extent of the collateral securing such indebtedness 
mariner will pay interest on the notes on april and october of each year 
the notes mature on april  there is no sinking fund for the notes 
mariner and its restricted subsidiaries are subject to certain negative covenants under the indenture governing the notes 
the indenture governing the notes limits mariner s and each of its restricted subsidiaries ability to  among other things make investments  incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock  create certain liens  sell assets  enter into agreements that restrict dividends or other payments from its subsidiaries to itself  consolidate  merge or transfer all or substantially all of its assets  engage in transactions with affiliates  pay dividends or make other distributions on capital stock or subordinated indebtedness  and create unrestricted subsidiaries 

table of contents future uses of capital 
our identified needs for liquidity in the future are as follows funding future capital expenditures  funding hurricane repairs and hurricane related abandonment operations  financing any future acquisitions that mariner may identify  paying routine operating and administrative expenses  and paying other commitments comprised largely of cash settlement of hedging obligations and debt service 
capital expenditures 
we anticipate that total capital expenditures for will approximate million excluding hurricane expenditures  with approximately allocated to development activities  to exploration activities  and the remainder to other items primarily capitalized overhead and interest 
in addition  we expect to incur additional hurricane related abandonment costs related to hurricanes katrina and rita of approximately million during  as well as additional facility repair costs that cannot be estimated at this time but which we do not believe will be material 
while this will be a cash outflow in  we expect to recover these costs through insurance reimbursements beginning in early  although complete insurance settlement of all hurricane related claims may take several additional quarters 
see business and properties insurance matters under items and since we believe these costs to be reimbursable  they will not be reflected in reported capital expenditures 
contractual commitments we have numerous contractual commitments in the ordinary course of business  debt service requirements and operating lease commitments 
the following table summarizes these commitments at december  less more than than one total year years years years in millions debt obligations interest obligations operating leases abandonment liabilities mms royalty liabilities seismic obligations capital accrual obligations other liabilities total contractual cash commitments as of december   we had incurred debt obligations under our bank credit facility and the senior unsecured notes that are due on march  and april   respectively 
interest obligations represent interest due on the senior unsecured notes at 
future interest obligations under our bank credit facility are uncertain  due to the variable interest rate on fluctuating balances 
based on a weighted average interest rate on amounts outstanding under our bank credit facility as of december   million  million and million would be due under the bank credit facility in less than one year  years and years  respectively 
future capital resources 
our anticipated sources of liquidity in the future are as follows cash flow from operations in future periods  proceeds under our bank credit facility  
table of contents proceeds from insurance policies relating to hurricane repairs  and proceeds from future capital markets transactions as needed 
in  we intend to tailor our capital program within our projected operating cash flow so that our operating capital requirements are largely self sustaining under normal commodity price assumptions 
we anticipate using proceeds under our bank credit facility only for working capital needs or acquisitions and not generally to fund our operations 
we would generally expect to fund future acquisitions on a case by case basis through a combination of bank debt and capital markets activities 
based on our current operating plan and assumed price case  our expected cash flow from operations and continued access to our bank credit facility allow us ample liquidity to conduct our operations as planned for the foreseeable future 
the timing of expenditures especially regarding deepwater projects is unpredictable 
also  our cash flows are heavily dependent on the oil and natural gas commodity markets  and our ability to hedge oil and natural gas prices is limited by our bank credit facility to no more than of our expected production from proved developed producing reserves 
if either oil or natural gas commodity prices decrease from their current levels  our ability to finance our planned capital expenditures could be affected negatively 
amounts available for borrowing under our bank credit facility are largely dependent on our level of proved reserves and current oil and natural gas prices 
if either our proved reserves or commodity prices decrease  amounts available to us to borrow under our bank credit facility could be reduced 
if our cash flows are less than anticipated or amounts available for borrowing are reduced  we may be forced to defer planned capital expenditures 
off balance sheet arrangements letters of credit on march   mariner obtained a million letter of credit under its bank credit facility that is not included as a use of the borrowing base 
the letter of credit was issued in favor of forest to secure performance of our obligation to drill and complete wells under an existing drill to earn program 
this letter of credit will reduce periodically by an amount equal to the product of million times the number of wells exceeding that are drilled and completed 
as of january  the letter of credit had been reduced by approximately million  based upon wells drilled and completed as of december  we expect additional reductions based upon quarterly drilling activity  with the next reduction anticipated in april the letter of credit balance as of december  was million 
mariner s bank credit facility also has a letter of credit subfacility of up to million that is included as a use of the borrowing base 
as of december   four such letters of credit totaling million were outstanding  million of which is required for plugging and abandonment obligations at certain of mariner s offshore fields 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity prices and related hedging activities our major market risk exposure continues to be the prices applicable to our natural gas and oil production 
the sales price of our production is primarily driven by the prevailing market price 
historically  prices received for our natural gas and oil production have been volatile and unpredictable 
hypothetically  if production levels were to remain at levels  a decrease in commodity prices would impact our cash flow by approximately million for the year ended december  the energy markets have historically been very volatile  and we can reasonably expect that oil and gas prices will be subject to wide fluctuations in the future 
if an effort to reduce the effects of the volatility of the price of oil and natural gas on our operations  management has adopted a policy of hedging oil and natural gas prices from time to time primarily through the use of commodity price swap agreements and costless collar arrangements 
while the use of these hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  it also limits future gains from favorable movements 
in addition  forward price curves and estimates of future volatility are used to assess and measure the ineffectiveness of our open contracts at the end of each period 
if open contracts cease to qualify for hedge accounting  the mark to market change in fair value is recognized in the income statement 
loss of hedge accounting and cash flow designation will cause 
table of contents volatility in earnings 
the fair values we report in our financial statements change as estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions or other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
as of december   mariner had the following hedge contracts outstanding december  weighted average fair fixed price swaps quantity fixed price value gain loss in millions natural gas mmbtus january december  january september  total december  fair costless collars quantity floor cap value gain loss in millions crude oil bbls january december  january december  natural gas mmbtus january december  january december  total as of december   mariner had the following hedge contracts outstanding weighted december  average fair fixed price swaps quantity fixed price value gain loss in millions crude oil bbls january december  natural gas mmbtus january december  total december  fair costless collars quantity floor cap value gain loss in millions crude oil bbls january december  january december  natural gas mmbtus january december  january december  total 
table of contents as of march   there were no hedging transactions entered into subsequent to december  except as follows weighted average fixed price swaps quantity fixed price crude oil bbls june december  january december  we have reviewed the financial strength of our counterparties and believe the credit risk associated with these swaps and costless collars to be minimal 
hedges with counterparties that are lenders under our bank credit facility are secured under the bank credit facility 
the following table sets forth the results of third party hedging transactions during the periods indicated year ended december  natural gas quantity settled mmbtus gain loss on natural gas contracts settled in thousands crude oil quantity settled mbbls gain loss on crude oil contracts settled in thousands the cash activity on contracts settled for natural gas and oil produced during resulted in an million gain 
an unrealized gain of million was recognized for related to the ineffective portion of open contracts that were not eligible for deferral under sfas due primarily to the basis differentials between the contract price  which is nymex based for oil and henry hub based for gas  and the indexed price at the point of sale 
in addition  the fair value of oil and natural gas derivatives acquired through the forest merger resulted in a million non cash gain 
the fair value of the acquired derivatives was fully recognized in in accordance with purchase price accounting implemented at the time of the merger of our former indirect parent on march   we recorded the mark to market liability of our hedge contracts at such date totaling million as a liability on our balance sheet 
see critical accounting policies and estimates hedging program 
for the years ended december  and  million and million  respectively  of the million and million total decrease in natural gas and oil sales  respectively  of cash hedge losses relate to the liability recorded at the time of the merger 
interest rates borrowings under our bank credit facility  discussed above  mature on march   and bear interest at either a libor based rate or a prime based rate  at our option  plus a specified margin 
both options expose us to risk of earnings loss due to changes in market rates 
we have not entered into interest rate hedges that would mitigate such risk 
during  the interest rate on our outstanding bank debt averaged 
if the balance of our bank debt at december  were to remain constant  a increase in market interest rates would impact our cash flow by approximately million for the year ended december
