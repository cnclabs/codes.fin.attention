table of contents liquidity and capital resources 
this section provides an analysis of our cash flows and a discussion of our outstanding debt and commitments that existed as of december  included in the discussion of outstanding debt is a discussion of our financial capacity to fund our future commitments and a discussion of other financing arrangements 
recent developments historically  our operations consisted of three business segments based on the services provided by each financial institution outsourcing  systems and services  health plan management services  and investment support services 
as part of our fiserv initiative  we are focused on providing products and services in a more integrated manner 
accordingly  in december  we announced a reorganization of our businesses to provide for a more streamlined structure 
the new organization allows us to provide integrated technology based solutions to each of the three main areas of the insurance industry health  life  and property and casualty 
as a result of this reorganization  we have modified our reporting segments such that our new reporting segments are financial institution services financial  insurance services insurance  and investment support services investment 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances 
actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates 
the majority of our revenues are generated from monthly account and transaction based fees 
revenue is recognized when the related services have been rendered 
revenues are primarily recognized under service agreements that are long term in nature  generally three to five years  and that do not require management to make significant judgments or assumptions 
given the nature of our business and the rules governing revenue recognition  our revenue recognition practices do not contain significant estimates that materially affect our results of operations 
additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we review the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets by comparing the underlying carrying value or reporting unit carrying value to their fair values 
as of the most recent impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of  we determined that the carrying amounts of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets do not exceed their respective fair values 
we are required to perform this comparison  which involves a number of assumptions  at least annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment 
given the significance of goodwill and intangible asset balances  an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge  which could be material to our financial statements 
we do not participate in  nor have we created  any off balance sheet variable interest entities or other off balance sheet financing  other than operating leases 
in addition  we do not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes and use derivative financial instruments for managing our exposure to changes in interest rates and managing our ratio of fixed to floating rate long term debt 
recent accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  requires companies to expense the value of employee stock option grants and similar awards 
we adopted sfas r on january  under the modified prospective method 
accordingly  prior periods 
table of contents do not include share based compensation expense related to sfas r 
share based compensation expense was million and million during and  respectively 
prior to january   we accounted for stock options  restricted stock and our employee stock purchase plan in accordance with the intrinsic value provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
under apb  the difference between the quoted market price on the date of grant and the contractual purchase price of shares was recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period 
as a result  we did not recognize compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements for stock options because the exercise price was not less than of the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
in september  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas 
sfas requires companies to recognize the funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans on sponsoring employers balance sheets and to recognize changes in the funded status in the year the changes occur 
the recognition provisions of sfas became effective for fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken  or expected to be taken  in a tax return  and provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we expect that the adoption of fin will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently assessing the impact that the adoption of sfas will have on our financial statements 
non gaap financial measures in this report  we use two non gaap financial measures  internal revenue growth percentage and free cash flow 
we use these measures to monitor and evaluate our performance  and they are presented in this report because we believe that they are useful to investors in evaluating our financial results 
non gaap financial measures should not be considered to be a substitute for the reported results prepared in accordance with gaap 
the methods that we use to calculate non gaap financial measures are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 
internal revenue growth percentage is measured as the increase or decrease in total revenue for the current year less acquired revenue from acquisitions divided by total revenues from the prior year plus acquired revenue from acquisitions 
acquired revenue from acquisitions represents pre acquisition revenue of acquired companies  less dispositions  for the prior year 
acquired revenue from acquisitions was million million in the financial segment and million in the insurance segment and million million in the financial segment and million in the insurance segment in and  respectively 
internal revenue growth percentage is a non gaap financial measure that we believe is useful to investors because it allows them to see the portion of our revenue growth that is attributed to acquired companies as compared to internal revenue growth 
free cash flow is measured as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less capital expenditures 
free cash flow is a non gaap financial measure that we believe is useful to investors because it shows our available cash flow after we have satisfied the capital requirements of our operations 

table of contents results of operations components of revenue and expenses the following summary describes the components of revenues and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of income 
a description of our revenue recognition policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
processing and services processing and services revenues are primarily generated from account and transaction based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years 
revenue is recognized when the related transactions are processed and services have been rendered 
processing and services revenues are most reflective of our core business performance because a significant amount of our total operating profit is generated by these services 
cost of processing and services includes costs directly associated with providing services to clients and includes the following personnel  equipment and data communication  infrastructure costs  including costs to maintain applications  customer support  depreciation  and other operating expenses 
product product revenue is primarily derived from our pharmacy businesses  software license fees and integrated print and electronic communications 
a significant amount of product revenue is derived from our pharmacy businesses within the insurance segment because we include  in both revenues and expenses  the prescription product costs associated with these businesses 
we do not manufacture or generally distribute prescription pharmaceuticals  but we are considered to be a principal under emerging issues task force eitf no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
therefore  we record these revenues and expenses on a gross basis 
prescription product costs included in both product revenues and cost of product were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cost of products  in addition to pharmacy product costs  include personnel  infrastructure costs and other costs directly associated with product revenue 
we also include customer reimbursements  such as postage and telecommunication costs  in processing and services revenue  product revenue  cost of processing and services  and cost of product in accordance with eitf  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred

total revenues total revenues increased million  or  in compared to  and million  or  in compared to the internal revenue growth rate was in and in with the remaining growth resulting from acquisitions 
overall internal revenue growth is primarily derived from sales to new clients  cross sales to existing clients and increases in transaction volumes from existing clients 
the improvement in the total revenue growth rate for compared to was primarily due to increased prescription revenue from new clients in the insurance segment s pharmacy management and workers compensation businesses 
processing and services revenues increased in and in compared to the prior year periods 
these increases were driven by sales to new clients  cross sales to existing clients  increases in transaction volumes from existing clients and incremental revenue attributable to several acquisitions 
partially offsetting these increases in were a million decrease in contract termination fees and the impact of the loss of two clients in contract termination and assignment fees were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the financial segment businesses generally enter into three to five year contracts with clients that contain early contract termination fees 
these fees can be generated when an existing client is acquired by another financial institution and can vary significantly from period to period based on the number and size of clients that are acquired and how early in the contract term a client is acquired 
product revenues increased in compared to and in compared to primarily due to new clients in the insurance segment s pharmacy management and workers compensation businesses 
table of contents along with growth in card fulfillment and print services within the output solutions division

total expenses total expenses increased million  or  in compared to and million  or  in compared to these increases were primarily driven by the significant increase in prescription product costs 
cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenues were relatively consistent in as compared to and the slight increase from in to in was primarily caused by a decrease of million in of higher margin contract termination fee revenue 
these fees  which were significantly higher in than  do not generate substantial incremental cost when received 
cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenues decreased in and from in due primarily to changes in the mix of our businesses  including acquisitions and the impact of operating efficiencies 
cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was in  in and in the increases in cost of product were primarily driven by the significant increase in prescription product costs in and as discussed above 
selling  general and administrative expenses have remained relatively consistent as a percentage of total revenues in  and selling  general and administrative expenses in were negatively impacted by the inclusion of million of incremental share based compensation expense as a result of the prospective adoption of sfas r on january   and million related to the write down of assets and facility shutdown costs in our lending division

partially offsetting these decreases in operating income and margin were increases in higher margin revenues in the electronic payments and flood insurance processing businesses  continued strong operating results in bank and credit union core processing and improvements in overall operating efficiencies 
in addition  operating margins in and were negatively impacted by the significant revenue growth in the pharmacy management and workers compensation businesses  which generate operating margins in the low to mid single digits 
the negative impact on operating margins due to the inclusion of prescription product costs in revenue and expense was approximately percentage points in and and percentage points in segment results in connection with organizational changes in  we reclassified our reportable segments for all periods presented to align them with how our chief operating decision maker currently manages the business 
as a result  our continuing operations are classified into three business segments financial institution services financial

the historical business segment information presented below has been restated to conform to our new business segment reporting structure

partially offsetting these negative factors in were higher margin revenues in the electronic payments businesses  continued strong operating results in the bank and credit union processing businesses and overall operating efficiencies 
operating margins in were positively impacted over primarily by a million increase in contract termination fees 
insurance revenues in the insurance segment increased million  or  in compared to and million  or  in compared to the internal revenue growth rate in this segment was in and in with the remaining growth resulting from acquisitions

the inclusion of prescription product costs in revenue and expense negatively impacted operating margins in the insurance segment by percentage points  percentage points and percentage points in  and  respectively 
investment the investment segment had revenue growth of million in and million in representing revenue growth of and  respectively 
revenue growth in each year was primarily the result of new client growth 
revenue growth in was lower than primarily due to a decrease in deposit levels resulting from strong equity markets which negatively impacted investment income and corresponding revenues 
operating margins in the investment segment were in  in and in operating income and margin in were negatively impacted by the mix of revenue with a lower level of higher margin investment income as compared to the increase in operating income and margin in compared to was primarily due to a temporary increase in cash investment balances in that improved net investment income 
discontinued operations on march   we completed the sale of our securities clearing businesses to fidelity global brokerage group  inc fidelity for million paid in cash at closing  subject to certain post closing adjustments 
prior to completion of the sale  the securities clearing businesses paid a million cash distribution to us 
the sales proceeds  net of related expenses  including taxes that became due upon the sale of the securities clearing businesses  approximated the carrying value of this investment 
in  we recorded a net loss on the sale of discontinued operations of million  net of related income taxes of million 
the higher income tax expense on the sale of the securities clearing operations was primarily due to a significantly lower tax basis than book basis mainly due to a tax free exchange in our initial purchase of one of the companies that was sold 
during  we recorded per share in diluted earnings in discontinued operations primarily as a result of favorable resolutions of income tax uncertainties 
in  we finalized and recognized a million pre tax gain related to a contingent payment that we received from fidelity based on the securities clearing businesses achievement of revenue targets established in the stock purchase agreement 
we are investigating a matter identified in an indemnification notice delivered pursuant to the stock purchase agreement 
the matter relates to the securities clearing businesses past maintenance of certain documentation related to introducing broker dealers customers 
we are unable to estimate or predict the ultimate outcome of this matter or to determine whether this matter will have a material adverse impact on the discontinued operations results 
interest expense and interest income interest expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the million increase in interest expense in was primarily due to an increase in average borrowings outstanding due to acquisitions and additional share repurchases in and interest income was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the million decrease in interest income in and the million increase in interest income in was primarily due to increased cash balances in resulting from the proceeds we received for the sale of our securities clearing businesses 

table of contents realized gain from sale of investments in  we realized a pre tax gain of million  or per share after income taxes  from the sale of our remaining ownership of million shares of common stock of bisys group  inc in addition  we sold our investment in intria items  inc to our joint venture partner  canadian imperial bank of commerce  which resulted in a pre tax gain of million  or per share after income taxes 
income tax provision the effective income tax rate for continuing operations was in  in and in the effective income tax rates for and were favorably impacted by a number of one time items compared to primarily associated with changes in state tax laws  finalization of various tax returns and a lower tax rate on the sale of investments

free cash flow in was negatively impacted by lower contract termination fee revenue  after income taxes  of approximately million and million due to the treatment of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises  which are required by sfas r to be included in cash flows from financing activities instead of operating cash flows as they were in and prior years 
in  we used our free cash flow and borrowings under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program primarily to fund acquisition related payments of million and to repurchase million shares of our common stock for million 
as of december   million shares of our common stock were available for repurchase under previous authorizations by our board of directors 
on january   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million additional shares of our common stock 
share repurchases under the existing authorization are expected to be made through open market transactions as market conditions warrant 
shares repurchased have historically been held for issuance in connection with acquisitions and equity plans 
our current policy is to use our free cash flow to support future business opportunities and repurchase shares of our common stock  rather than to pay dividends 

table of contents at december   we had million of long term debt of which million was outstanding under our revolving credit and commercial paper facilities 
we maintain a million unsecured commercial paper program  which is exempt from registration under the securities act of under this program  we may issue commercial paper with maturities of up to days from the date of issuance 
we also maintain a million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks 
we may increase the availability under this facility up to billion at our discretion  subject to a number of conditions  including the absence of any default under the credit agreement 
the revolving credit facility supports of our outstanding commercial paper 
as a result  borrowings under the commercial paper program reduce the amount of credit available under the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility contains various restrictions and covenants 
among other requirements  our consolidated indebtedness is limited to no more than three and one half times consolidated net earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
the facility expires on march  we were in compliance with all debt covenants throughout we believe that our cash flow from operations together with other available sources of funds will be adequate to meet our operating requirements  required operating lease payments  required repayments of long term debt  and expected capital spending needs in at december   we had million available for borrowing under our credit and commercial paper facilities and million of cash and cash equivalents 
in the event that we make significant future acquisitions  we may raise funds through additional borrowings or the issuance of common shares 
historically  our growth has been accomplished  to a significant degree  through the acquisition of businesses that are complementary to our operations 
we believe that a number of acquisition candidates are available that would further enhance our competitive position and we plan to pursue them 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases 
purchase obligations primarily relate to agreements to purchase or license data processing equipment and software

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices  interest rates  indices  correlations or other market factors  such as liquidity  will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments 
we are exposed primarily to interest rate risk and market price risk on investments and borrowings 
we actively monitor these risks through a variety of control procedures involving senior management 
our investment support services subsidiaries accept money market account deposits from customers and invest those funds in marketable securities 
substantially all of the investments are rated within the highest investment grade categories for securities 
our investment support services subsidiaries utilize simulation models for measuring and monitoring interest rate risk and market value of portfolio equities 
a formal asset liability committee meets quarterly to review interest rate risks  capital ratios  liquidity levels  portfolio diversification  credit risk ratings and adherence to investment policies and guidelines 
at december   mortgage backed obligations have an average duration of approximately three years and eleven months with most of the remaining investments having a maturity of one year or less 
we do not believe significant changes in interest rates would have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we manage our debt structure and interest rate risk through the use of fixed and floating rate debt and through the use of interest rate swaps 
we use interest rate swaps to partially hedge our exposure to interest rate changes and to control financing costs 
generally  under these swaps  we agree with a counter party to exchange the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts based on an agreed notional amount 
while changes in interest rates could decrease our interest income or increase our interest expense  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to changes in interest rates 
based on our long term debt with variable interest rates as of december   a increase in our borrowing rate would increase annual interest expense by approximately million 
based on our internal controls  we believe the risks associated with financial instruments at december  will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations
