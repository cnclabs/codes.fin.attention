overall  operating income in increased  or percent from  despite weather that was percent warmer than in however  the increase in operating income was offset by a decline of  or percent  in other income  net of other expenses  and increases in interest expense of  or percent  and income taxes of  or percent 
the net result was that net income was up by only  or percent 
the following discussions and those later in the document on operating income and segment results include use of the term gross margin 
gross margin is determined by deducting the cost of sales from operating revenue 
cost of sales includes the purchased gas cost for natural gas and propane and the cost of labor spent on direct revenue producing activities 
gross margin should not be considered an alternative to operating income or net income  which are determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
chesapeake believes that gross margin  although a non gaap measure  is useful and meaningful to investors as a basis for making investment decisions 
it provides investors with information that demonstrates the profitability achieved by the company under its allowed rates for regulated operations and under its competitive pricing structure for non regulated segments 
chesapeake s management uses gross margin in measuring its business units performance and has historically analyzed and reported gross margin information publicly 
other companies may calculate gross margin in a different manner 
page management s discussion and analysis operating income the year reflects the strong year over year operating income growth experienced by the company s natural gas operations of  or percent 
this growth was offset by reductions in operating income from propane and advanced information services 
in  both natural gas and propane segments were negatively impacted by weather that was percent warmer than in the company estimates that the warmer weather reduced gross margin by million in the natural gas segment was able to overcome the weather impact and show an increase in operating income due to its growth and cost containment efforts 
however  as the propane segment is more weather sensitive and is not experiencing the high level of growth of our natural gas segment  its operating income declined when compared to advanced information services experienced a decrease in operating income in as compared to the prior year due in part to the gain on the sale of lightweight association management processing system lamps tm during the fourth quarter of the lamps product was internally developed software that was developed and marketed specifically for realtor associations 
key financial and operational highlights for fiscal year include the following customer growth in the natural gas and propane businesses remained strong  with the delmarva and florida natural gas distribution operations registering and percent increases in residential customers  respectively  and the delmarva community gas systems cgs generating a percent increase in propane distribution customers

on september   the company received approval for a base rate increase from the maryland public service commission psc for our maryland natural gas operations  with the new base rates effective october  the base rate adjustment results in an increase in base rates of approximately  which would result in an average increase in revenues of approximately percent for the company s firm residential  commercial and industrial customers in maryland

if completed  the project will expand the capacity of its interstate pipeline system by approximately percent 
we still have significant obstacles to overcome on this project to make it a reality 
in  eastern shore will initiate the processes required to obtain the ferc and other federal  state and local permits required to construct the project

valuation of environmental assets and liabilities as more fully described in note m to the financial statements  chesapeake has completed its responsibilities related to one environmental site and is currently participating in the investigation  assessment or remediation of three other former manufactured gas plant sites 
amounts have been recorded as environmental liabilities and associated environmental regulatory assets based on estimates of future costs provided by independent consultants 
there is uncertainty in these amounts because the environmental protection agency epa or applicable state environmental authority may not have selected the final remediation methods 
additionally  there is uncertainty due to the outcome of legal remedies sought from other potentially responsible parties

cash flows provided by operating activities our cash flows provided by used in operating activities were as follows for the years ended december  net income non cash adjustments to net income changes in working capital net cash from operating activties year over year changes in our cash flows from operating activities are attributable primarily to net income  depreciation and working capital changes 
the changes in working capital are impacted by weather  the price of natural gas and propane  the timing of customer collections  payments of natural gas and propane purchases  and deferred gas cost recoveries 
the company generates a large portion of its annual net income and subsequent increases in our accounts receivable in the first and fourth quarters of each year due to significant volumes of natural gas and propane delivered by our delmarva natural gas and propane distribution operations to our customers during the peak heating season 
in addition  our natural gas and propane inventories  which usually peak in the fall months  are largely drawn down in the heating season and provide a source of cash as the inventory is used to satisfy winter sales demand 
during this period  our accounts payable increased to reflect payments due to providers of the natural gas  propane commodities and pipeline capacity 
the value of the natural gas and propane can vary significantly from one period to the next as a result of volatility in the prices of these commodities 
our natural gas costs and deferred purchased natural gas costs due from  or to  our customers represent the difference between natural gas costs that we have paid to suppliers in the past and amounts that we have collected from customers 
these natural gas costs can cause significant variations in cash flows from period to period
