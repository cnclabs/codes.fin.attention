item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in thousands introduction the following discussion provides an assessment of the results of our operations and liquidity and capital resources together with a brief description of certain accounting policies 
accordingly  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements included within this report 
overview we  through our operating subsidiaries  are one of the world s leading manufacturers of musical instruments 
our strategy is to capitalize on our strong brand names  leading market positions  strong distribution networks  and quality products 
piano segment sales of our pianos are influenced by general economic conditions  demographic trends and general interest in music and the arts 
the operating results of our piano segment are primarily affected by steinway sons grand piano sales 
given the total number of these pianos that we sell in any year  sold in  a slight change in units sold can have a material impact on our business and operating results 
our results are also influenced by sales of boston and essex pianos  which together represented almost of total piano units sold but less than of total piano revenues in our boston piano line and many of our essex piano models are sourced from asia by single manufacturers 
the ability of these manufacturers to produce and ship products to us could impact our business and operating results 
in  approximately of piano sales were in the united states  in europe and the remaining primarily in asia 
for the year ended december   our piano segment sales were million  representing of our total revenues 
piano outlook for overall  we expect a relatively stable year for our piano segment with respect to sales and gross profit 
similar to  we anticipate some unevenness domestically  which should be offset by continued improvement overseas 
we intend to focus on reducing existing inventory levels  developing our distribution structure in china  and implementing various manufacturing improvement initiatives in the upcoming year 
we currently have sufficient  but not excessive  manufacturing capacity to meet anticipated or increased demand 
band segment our student band instrument sales are influenced by trends in school enrollment  general attitudes toward music and the arts  and our ability to provide competitively priced products to our dealer network 
management estimates that of our domestic band sales are generated through educational programs  the remainder is sales to amateur or professional musicians or performing groups  including symphonies and orchestras 
recently  our sales growth has been adversely affected by the ongoing strike at our elkhart  indiana brass instrument plant  which started april  further  two of our large dealers filed for bankruptcy in  which negatively impacted demand for certain products 
with respect to sourced products  we continue to expand our offerings to include quality  competitively priced brand name imported instruments that are built to our specifications 
our product offerings are tailored to the needs of traditional school music dealers who provide full service rental programs to beginning band students  as well as music retailers and e commerce dealers selling directly to end consumers from their stores or through the internet 
we believe our product offerings have helped us remain competitive at various price points and will continue to do so in the future 
in  beginner instruments accounted for approximately of band orchestral unit shipments and approximately of band instrument revenues  with advanced and professional instruments representing the balance 
in  approximately of band sales were in the united states  in europe and the remaining primarily in canada and asia 
for the year ended december   our band sales were million  representing of our total revenues 
band outlook for we are entering with backorders for products made at our elkhart  indiana brass instrument manufacturing facility which is currently on strike  and have backorders for other us made and sourced products 
we expect to have replacement workers at the brass facility fully trained and producing efficiently by the end of further  we expect the production improvements at our other facilities to continue in and are working with our sourced product suppliers to improve availability and output as we add new models to our existing product lines 
however  we do have some large dealers that have reduced their order volume significantly from the prior period  due to bankruptcies and changes in strategic growth initiatives due to acquisitions 
barring any further changes in our dealer network or orders in the current year  we expect stable revenue and improved margins towards the end of inflation and foreign currency impact although we cannot accurately predict the precise effect of inflation on our operations  we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on sales or results of operations in recent years 
sales to customers outside the united states represented of consolidated sales in we record sales in euro  japanese yen  british pounds  and chinese yuan 
in  we generated of our international sales through our piano segment 
foreign exchange rate changes impacted sales by approximately million in the current year 
although currency fluctuation affects international sales  it also affects cost of sales and related operating expenses 
consequently  it generally has not had a material impact on operating income 
we use financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts and currency options to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on firm and anticipated cash flow exposures and certain assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the affected division 
we do not purchase currency related financial instruments for purposes other than exchange rate risk management 
taxes we are subject to us income taxes as well as tax in several foreign jurisdictions in which we do business 
some of these foreign jurisdictions have higher statutory rates than the united states 
in addition  certain of our operations are subject to both us and foreign taxes 
however  in such cases we receive a credit against our us taxes for foreign taxes paid equal to the percentage that such foreign income as adjusted for reallocated interest represents of the total income subject to us tax 
accordingly  our effective tax rates will vary depending on the relative proportion of foreign to us income and the absorption of foreign tax credits in the united states 
in  we were able to use the majority  but not all  of the foreign tax credits generated in that period 
however  because the american jobs creation act of the act extended the foreign tax credit carryover period  we were able to recognize a partial benefit for the excess foreign tax credits generated in in  we were unable to utilize approximately one third of the foreign tax credits generated during the year 
this  coupled with the income generated in higher rate jurisdictions such as germany  resulted in an increase in our overall tax rate in that year 
in  we were unable to utilize any of the foreign tax credits generated in the current period as we incurred a loss from operations subject to us tax due to our debt restructuring costs and the strike at one of our brass instrument plants 
based on the carryforward period  the impact of an anticipated reduction in the german tax rates in  and other tax planning strategies  we have recognized the full benefit for the excess foreign tax credits generated in the current year 
the overall effective tax rate of in differs from the statutory rate primarily due to foreign taxes that are not creditable against us taxes  permanent differences between book and tax income and expenses  and state taxes 
the overall effective rate is also a function of the insignificant level of loss before income taxes  for which a small change in any amount results in a large percentage change in effective tax rate 
we currently anticipate a return to a more normal overall effective tax rate of approximately for results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year change for the years ended december  net sales band piano total sales cost of sales band piano total cost of sales gross profit band piano total gross profit operating expenses provision for doubtful accounts total operating expenses income from operations other income  net loss on extinguishment of debt net interest expense loss income before income taxes income tax provision net loss income overview in our band business suffered due to the strike at our elkhart  indiana brass instrument plant  which has been ongoing since april st  and the bankruptcy filings of two large customers 
although production levels at most of our other facilities were either stable or improved  both band division sales and gross margins deteriorated in the current year 
our piano division sales improved marginally in the united states and more significantly abroad  as customers reacted favorably to our essex product re launch 
piano margins declined slightly due to reduced production at the domestic manufacturing facility in the first half of the year 
net sales net sales decreased million due to an estimated million in lower brass instrument sales caused by the strike which began april st at one of our elkhart  indiana manufacturing facilities 
overall band unit shipments remained stable as the decrease in band units was offset by increases in stringed and percussion unit shipments 
total piano sales improved million to million in domestic sales increased million  despite lower steinway grand unit shipments  due to the increase in total piano unit shipments of  which was largely attributable to our essex product re launch mid year 
overseas  revenues increased million  including million attributable to foreign currency translation 
this resulted from improved demand for all product lines in both europe and asia 
gross profit gross profit decreased million due to band division results for the period 
we estimate lost gross profit of million on the lost brass instrument sales mentioned above 
band gross profit was also adversely impacted by million of unabsorbed overhead at the elkhart  indiana brass instrument manufacturing plant  approximately half of which was incurred in the second and third quarters and resulted from the lack of production due to the strike 
the remainder was incurred in the fourth quarter and was due to production inefficiencies as we trained replacement workers at that location 
band margins were less affected by atypical charges in the current period 
these costs totaled million in  compared to million in  and arose from the sell through of purchased leblanc inventory  which was written up to fair value upon acquisition 
improved production at other facilities  such as the woodwind manufacturing facility  helped mitigate the margin deterioration caused by the strike 
piano segment gross profit increased million due to the increase in piano division sales 
however  margins deteriorated slightly from to primarily due to three weeks of additional plant shutdown at our domestic manufacturing facility  which were taken to control inventory levels 
operating expenses operating expenses increased million  mostly due to the million increase in the provision for doubtful accounts  which increased due to bankruptcy filings of two large band division customers in july and november the remaining increase in operating expenses resulted from band division recruiting and personnel relocation activities of million and legal costs of million  a large portion of which is attributable to the strike 
an increase in bonuses of million for the overseas piano divisions and an increase in promotion and sales costs associated with our essex re launch of million accounted for most of the remaining increase 
non operating expenses non operating expenses increased million in due to the loss on extinguishment of debt of million resulting from the refinancing of our senior notes and the early repayment of our acquisition term loan 
this net loss was comprised of premiums paid to bondholders of million  the write off of term loan related deferred financing fees of million  and the write off of bond related deferred financing fees of million  which were offset in part by the write off of bond premium of million 
we incurred million in loss on extinguishment of debt in the prior year period resulting from the repurchase of million of our senior notes and the write off of the associated deferred financing fees 
other income  net improved million due to a shift of million from foreign exchange losses to foreign exchange gains during the period 
net interest expense decreased million as a result of million increase in interest income  which resulted from interest earned on our higher average cash balance at higher interest rates during the current period 
lower interest expense of million due to our debt refinancing and lower borrowings on our credit facilities also contributed to the net interest expense decrease 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year change for the years ended december  net sales band piano total sales cost of sales band piano total cost of sales gross profit band piano total gross profit operating expenses facility rationalization total operating expenses income from operations other income  net net interest expense income before income taxes income tax provision net income overview in we continued strengthening our band business 
our purchase of substantially all of the assets of g 
leblanc corporation in august resulted in sales growth for the segment 
we merged the administrative office operations of leblanc into our existing operations in may  thereby eliminating duplicative administrative costs 
production at our woodwind facility  which was low in the early part of the year as we trained new workers  had significantly improved by the end of the period  and we continued to experience period over period improvement in our band segment margins 
our domestic piano division sales decreased due to unusually high turnover in sales personnel at the retail level  coupled with decreased demand for our boston piano lines 
however  overall piano segment sales remained stable  primarily due to the revenue generated by our european divisions 
piano margins declined slightly due to inefficiencies at both piano manufacturing facilities 
net sales net sales increased million as a result of the increase in band division sales  which was caused primarily by incremental sales of leblanc product through the first three quarters of overall band unit shipments increased due to the increase in brass and woodwind unit shipments of the largest component of the band business 
total piano sales remained stable at million 
domestically  sales declined  in part due to attrition of retail sales staff in the early part of the year  as well as the decrease in unit shipments of our boston piano lines 
in the united states  mid and lower priced piano sales were being adversely impacted by the influx of low priced asian imports 
however  the shift in mix towards higher priced units sold by our german division resulted in consistent piano segment revenues 
gross profit gross profit improved million driven by an increase in band sales and band margins 
band margins were less affected by atypical charges in the current period 
these costs totaled million in  and arose from the sell through of purchased leblanc inventory  which was written up to fair value upon acquisition 
in the prior period  atypical charges totaled million  comprised of million from the sell through of purchased leblanc inventory  and million from severance costs associated with plant closures 
band margins also benefited from a large  high margin sales transaction in the beginning of the fourth quarter 
piano segment gross profit decreased million despite the beneficial sales mix towards higher margin grands sold by our german division 
the adverse impact of factory inefficiencies due in part to the disruptions caused by implementing production line improvements  as well as a larger book to physical inventory adjustment at our domestic piano manufacturing facility were the primary causes of the piano margin decrease 
operating expenses operating expenses increased million  despite the decrease in external costs associated with sarbanes oxley compliance efforts  which were approximately million less in the incremental operating expenses are primarily sales and marketing  million of which resulted from commissions associated with the large sales transaction described above 
piano sales commissions also increased as a result of the favorable performance by the german division 
in addition  this division had incremental public relations and advertising costs of million as a result of its th anniversary celebrations 
lastly  million in additional operating expenses were associated with leblanc  and were incurred in the early part of the year  prior to the consolidation of band administrative offices 
non operating expenses non operating expenses increased million in approximately million of this increase related to losses on extinguishment of debt  which resulted from the buyback of million of our senior notes at  and the write off of the corresponding deferred financing costs 
a shift of million from foreign exchange gains to foreign exchange losses also contributed to the expense increase 
we incurred additional interest costs of approximately million due to the increase in interest rates during the year 
the remainder of the expense increase primarily resulted from reclassification of certain items from non operating expenses to operating expenses 
liquidity and capital resources we have relied primarily upon cash provided by operations  supplemented as necessary by seasonal borrowings under our domestic working capital line  to finance our operations  repay long term indebtedness  finance acquisitions  and fund our capital expenditures 
our overseas divisions  particularly in asia  are normally in a borrowing position on their lines 
these borrowings are likely to be less than million at any given time 
in  our domestic line borrowings peaked at approximately million  as a result of our acquisition of the net assets of leblanc  and in our borrowings peaked at approximately million due to seasonal borrowings 
in  our borrowings peaked at million  due to the repayment of our term loan in september 
cash flows our statements of cash flows are summarized as follows for the years ended december  net loss income changes in operating assets and liabilities other adjustments to reconcile net loss income to cash flows from operating activities cash flows from operating activities cash flows from investing activities cash flows from financing activities in  cash flows from operating activities  which decreased million  were impacted by many factors 
the decrease in net income was the largest factor  and resulted from many items which are added back in adjustments to cash flows from operating activities 
cash provided by inventory increased million due to increased piano sales combined with reduced production at our elkhart brass instrument facility 
cash used by accounts receivable increased million due to increased sales and extended payment terms offered as part of the essex re launch promotional activities and an increase in our band division aged receivable balance 
cash flows from operating activities was also impacted by the million purchase of securities which are classified as trading for our supplemental executive retirement plan serp 
this purchase was funded by the sale of existing serp securities and is described below 
we realized gains of million on the sale of these securities 
realized gains on the newly purchased securities were less than million for the year ended december  in  cash flows from operating activities increased million despite the increase in cash used for accounts payable of million 
this improvement was largely due to the increase in cash provided by inventory and receivables of million  which resulted from improved management of work in process inventory and receivables collections at our band division 
in  cash flows from operating activities decreased million 
this resulted primarily from working capital changes  as inventory increased in part to support our expansion in asia  and receivables increased in conjunction with band sales increases 
collectively  these working capital changes used million more than in the prior period 
cash transferred to workers compensation and environmental depositary trust funds which replaced more expensive letters of credit previously used also negatively impacted cash flows from operating activities 
in the use of cash for investing activities decreased million as we sold all of the securities in our serp  which were classified as available for sale securities  recognizing million in gross proceeds in the current period 
the remainder of the decrease was due to the absence of acquisition activity in the current period  as compared to million in the use of cash for investing activities decreased million in as million was used to fund our acquisition of leblanc in in  cash used for acquisitions was limited to the million final purchase price adjustment for leblanc 
capital expenditures were slightly higher than in prior periods at million in  million in and million in see capital expenditures discussion below 
cash used for financing activities in increased million due largely to our debt restructuring activities 
we refinanced our bonds  which generated proceeds of million  offset by the extinguishment of million of our senior note debt  and the repayment of our acquisition and real estate term loans 
although we had additional proceeds from the issuance of stock of million  premiums paid on the extinguishment of debt of million and costs related to the bond and domestic credit facility refinancing of million caused the increased use of cash in the current period 
in  cash flows from financing activities decreased million due in part to the million decrease in proceeds from issuance of stock 
in addition  we repaid approximately million on our line borrowings in the current year  whereas borrowings provided cash of million in the prior period 
lastly  in december  we repurchased million of our own senior notes at of face value  which resulted in a use of cash of million 
in  cash provided by financing activities of million resulted from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan activities totaling million  which more than offset the million in net borrowings and scheduled debt repayments 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures consist primarily of software and computer system conversions and upgrades  machinery and production equipment  and plant and facility improvements 
we expect capital spending in to be in the range of million  relating to facility maintenance and improvements  computer system maintenance and upgrades  and production equipment purchases 
seasonality consistent with industry practice  we sell band instruments almost entirely on credit utilizing the two financing programs described below 
due to these programs  we have large working capital requirements during certain times of the year when band instrument receivable balances reach highs of approximately million in august and september  and lesser requirements when they are at lows of approximately million in january and february 
the financing options  intended to assist dealers with the seasonality inherent in the industry and facilitate the rent to own programs offered to students by many retailers  also allow us to match our production and delivery schedules 
the following forms of financing are offered to qualified band instrument dealers a receivable dating payments on purchases made from october through august of the following year are due in october 
dealers are offered discounts for early payment 
b note receivable financing dealers that meet certain credit qualifications may convert open accounts to a note payable to us 
the note program is offered primarily in october and coincides with the receivable dating program 
the terms of the notes generally include payment over a nine to twelve month period with interest ranging from 
interest rates are contingent upon credit ratings and borrowing periods 
in certain situations  long term arrangements for up to months have been offered 
in most instances  the note receivable is secured by dealer inventories and receivables 
off balance sheet arrangements in  certain customers of our leblanc subsidiary financed notes receivable with a third party  to which we have a recourse obligation 
as of december   million of these notes remain outstanding 
we have included a corresponding recourse obligation of million in our financial statements at period end 
as of december   these notes and related reserves were less than million 
our total maximum recourse obligation under this arrangement includes the outstanding balance on the notes  as well as any interest or late fees that may be incurred by our customers 
we generally do not provide extended financing arrangements to our piano dealers 
to facilitate long term financing required by some dealers  we have arranged financing through third party providers 
we generally provide no guarantees with respect to these arrangements 
retail financing obligations certain of our retail sales overseas were financed by our customers through a local bank under an arrangement that included an obligation on our part to repurchase pianos seized by the bank upon default of the customer 
the buyback price is established as a percentage of the original sales price  starting at in the first year and declining to in the fifth year of the loan 
this program ceased in the first quarter of nevertheless  because our obligation continues until the bank is paid in full by the customer  our commitment can remain outstanding for up to years the maximum term of the consumer loan 
our maximum obligation under this arrangement is estimated to be approximately million million at the december  exchange rate 
to date  we have not been required to repurchase any pianos under this program and we believe the likelihood of such repurchases in the future is remote 
accordingly  we have not recognized a liability for this obligation in our financial statements 
further  in the unlikely event of a repurchase  we believe the proceeds received upon our resale of the piano would exceed the amount payable to the bank 
pensions and other postretirement benefits when determining the amounts to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to our domestic pension  we used a long term rate of return on plan assets of  which was developed with input from our actuaries and our investment committee  and is consistent with prior years 
we believe that is consistent with the historical long term return trends on our domestic pension assets and our expectations for future returns 
the discount rate utilized for determining future pension and other postretirement benefit obligations for our domestic plans is based on long term bonds receiving an aa or better rating by a recognized rating agency 
the discount rate used for december  and was 
the discount rates and rates of return on plan assets for our foreign pension and other postretirement benefit plans were similarly developed utilizing long term rates of return and discount rates reasonably expected to occur in the applicable jurisdiction 
borrowing activities and availability during the year ended december   we significantly restructured our long term debt 
in february we repaid our larger  higher interest term loan  which had an outstanding balance of million at the time of payoff 
we also issued million of senior notes and extended a tender offer to purchase the million of our outstanding senior notes 
we issued our new senior notes at  and received proceeds of million  net of associated fees 
we used the proceeds from this issuance to extinguish million of the senior notes pursuant to our tender offer in the first quarter of the remaining proceeds  supplemented by borrowings on our line of credit  were used to exercise our right to call the remaining million of senior notes on april  on september  we restructured our domestic credit facility and used our first borrowing  supplemented by cash on hand  to repay our remaining term loan  which had a balance of million at the time of payoff 
our restructured domestic credit facility provides us with a potential borrowing capacity of million in revolving credit loans  and expires on september  it also provides for borrowings at either london interbank offering rate libor plus a range from to or as needed borrowings at an alternate base rate  plus a range from to  both ranges depend upon availability at the time of borrowing 
borrowings are collateralized by our domestic accounts receivable  inventory and fixed assets 
our non domestic credit facilities provided for borrowings equivalent to million as of december  there have been no material changes to our borrowing abilities overseas  and we typically are in a borrowing position of less than million at any given time 
our non domestic credit facilities are discussed more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   our total outstanding indebtedness amounted to million  consisting of million of senior notes and million of notes payable to foreign banks 
cash interest paid was million in  million in  and million in all of our debt agreements contain covenants that place certain restrictions on us  including our ability to incur additional indebtedness  to make investments in other entities  and limitations on cash dividend payments 
we were in compliance with all such covenants as of december  and do not anticipate any compliance issues in our bond indenture contains limitations  based on net income among other things  on the amount of discretionary repurchases we may make of our ordinary common stock 
our intent and ability to repurchase additional ordinary common stock either directly from shareholders or on the open market is directly affected by this limitation 
we have reserved  shares of our existing treasury stock to be utilized for the exercise of outstanding stock options under our amended and restated stock plan 
these options have no impact on our cash flow or the number of shares outstanding unless and until the options are exercised 
we experience long production and inventory turnover cycles  which we constantly monitor since fluctuations in demand can have a significant impact on these cycles 
we were able to effectively utilize cash flow from operations to fund our debt and capital requirements and paid off our seasonal borrowings on our domestic line of credit 
looking forward to  we anticipate that both our piano and band divisions will perform consistently throughout the period 
our intention is to manage accounts receivable  reduce inventory levels  and repay credit facility borrowings 
other than the dividend described below  we do not have any current plans or intentions that will have a material impact on our liquidity in  although we may consider acquisitions that may require funding from operations or from our credit facilities 
other than those described  we are not aware of any trends  demands  commitments  or costs of resources that are expected to materially impact our liquidity or capital resources 
accordingly  we believe that cash on hand  together with cash flows anticipated from operations and available borrowings under the credit facility  will be adequate to meet our debt service requirements  fund continuing capital requirements and satisfy our working capital and general corporate needs through recent events on february   we declared a dividend of per share for shareholders of record as of february  this dividend payment  which amounted to million  was paid on march  we used existing cash on hand and borrowed approximately million domestically to facilitate this payment 
contractual obligations the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations at december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital leases operating leases purchase obligations other non current liabilities total notes to contractual obligations long term debt represents long term debt obligations  the fixed interest on our senior notes  and the variable interest on our other loans 
we estimated the future variable interest obligation using the applicable december  rates 
the nature of our long term debt obligations is described more fully in the borrowing availability and activities section of liquidity and capital resources 
approximately million of our operating lease obligations are attributable to the ninety nine year land lease associated with the purchase of steinway hall  which is described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included within this filing  the remainder is attributable to the leasing of other facilities and equipment 
purchase obligations consist of firm purchase commitments for raw materials  finished goods  and equipment 
our other long term liabilities consist primarily of the long term portion of our pension obligations  which are described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included within this filing  and obligations under employee and consultant agreements  which are described in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included within this filing 
critical accounting estimates the securities and exchange commission sec has issued disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in the company s annual report on form k 
not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
however  management considers the following to be critical accounting policies based on the definition above 
accounts receivable we establish reserves for accounts receivable and notes receivable including recourse reserves when our customers have financed notes receivable with a third party 
we review overall collectibility trends and customer characteristics such as debt leverage  solvency  and outstanding balances in order to develop our reserve estimates 
historically  a large portion of our sales at both our piano and band divisions have been generated by our top customers 
as a result  we experience some inherent concentration of credit risk in our accounts receivable due to its composition and the relative proportion of large customer receivables to the total 
this is especially true at our band division  which characteristically has the majority of our consolidated accounts receivable balance 
we consider the credit health and solvency of our customers when developing our receivable reserve estimates 
inventory we establish inventory reserves for items such as lower of cost or market and obsolescence 
we review inventory levels on a detailed basis  concentrating on the age and amounts of raw materials  work in process  and finished goods  as well as recent usage and sales dates and quantities to help develop our estimates 
ongoing changes in our business strategy  including a shift from batch processing to single piece production flow  coupled with increased offshore sourcing  could affect our ability to realize the current cost of our inventory  and are considered by management when developing our estimates 
we also establish reserves for anticipated book to physical adjustments based upon our historical level of adjustments from our annual physical inventories 
we cost our inventory using standard costs 
accordingly  variances between actual and standard costs that are not abnormal in nature are capitalized into inventory and released based on calculated inventory turns 
workers compensation and self insured health claims we establish workers compensation and self insured health claims reserves based on our trend analysis of data provided by third party administrators regarding historical claims and anticipated future claims 
warranty we establish reserves for warranty claims based on our analysis of historical claims data  recent claims trends  and the various lengths of time for which we warranty our products 
long lived assets we review long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we measure recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future cash flows the asset is expected to generate 
we test our goodwill and indefinite lived trademark assets for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of an asset may have decreased below its carrying value 
our assessment is based on several analyses  including multi year cash flows and a comparison of estimated fair values to our market capitalization 
pensions and other postretirement benefit costs we make certain assumptions when calculating our benefit obligations and expenses 
we base our selection of assumptions  such as discount rates and long term rates of return  on information provided by our actuaries  investment advisors  investment committee  current rate trends  and historical trends for our pension asset portfolio 
our benefit obligations and expenses can fluctuate significantly based on the assumptions management selects 
income taxes a valuation allowance has been recorded for certain deferred tax assets related to foreign tax credit carryforwards and state net operating loss carryforwards 
when assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be fully realized 
the ultimate realization of these assets is dependent upon many factors  including the ratio of foreign source income to overall income and generation of sufficient future taxable income in the states for which we have loss carryforwards 
when establishing or adjusting valuation allowances  we consider these factors  as well as anticipated trends in foreign source income and tax planning strategies which may impact future realizability of these assets 
stock based compensation we grant stock based compensation awards which generally vest over a specified period 
when determining the fair value of stock options and subscriptions to purchase shares under the purchase plan  we use the black scholes option valuation model  which requires input of certain management assumptions  including dividend yield  expected volatility  risk free interest rate  expected life of stock options granted during the period  and the life applicable to the purchase plan subscriptions 
the estimated fair value of the options and subscriptions to purchase shares  and the resultant stock based compensation expense  can fluctuate based on the assumptions used by management 
environmental liabilities we make certain assumptions when calculating our environmental liabilities 
we base our selection of assumptions  such as cost and length of time for remediation  on data provided by our environmental consultants  as well as information provided by regulatory authorities 
we also make certain assumptions regarding the indemnifications we have received from others  including whether remediation costs are within the scope of the indemnification  the indemnifier s ability to perform under the agreement  and whether past claims have been successful 
our environmental obligations and expenses can fluctuate significantly based on management s assumptions 
we believe the assumptions made by management provide a reasonable basis for the estimates reflected in our financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin sets a more likely than not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities  classification of current and deferred positions  accounting for income taxes in interim periods  and income tax disclosures 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and cumulative effects of its application will be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of january  we are currently evaluating the requirements of fin and have not yet determined the impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
on september   the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provides guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year financial statement misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
on september   the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the requirements of sfas no 
and have not yet determined the impact  if any  its adoption will have on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas no 

sfas no 
provides entities with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value  with the objective to reduce both the complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
we will be required to adopt sfas no 
in the first quarter of fiscal year we are currently evaluating the requirements of sfas no 
and have not yet determined the impact  if any  of its adoption on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we are subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we mitigate some of our cash flow exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by holding forward foreign currency contracts 
these contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes 
the contracts relate primarily to intercompany transactions and are not used for trading or speculative purposes 
the fair value of the forward foreign currency exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
as of december   a negative change in foreign currency exchange rates from market rates would decrease the fair value of the contracts by million 
gains and losses on the foreign currency exchange contracts are defined as the difference between the contract rate at its inception date and the current forward rate 
however  we would offset any such gains and losses by corresponding losses and gains  respectively  on the related asset or liability 
interest risk our interest rate exposure is limited primarily to interest rate changes on our variable rate debt 
our revolving loans bear interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in prime  libor  tibor  and euribor and are therefore sensitive to changes in market interest rates 
our term loans  which were repaid during the year  also bore interest at rates which fluctuated with changes in libor 
for the year ended december   a hypothetical increase in interest rates would have increased our interest expense by approximately million 
our long term debt includes million of senior notes with a fixed interest rate 
accordingly  there would be no immediate impact on our interest expense associated with these notes due to fluctuations in market interest rates 
however  based on a hypothetical immediate decrease in market interest rates  the fair value of our senior notes  which would be sensitive to such interest rate changes  would be increased by approximately million as of december
