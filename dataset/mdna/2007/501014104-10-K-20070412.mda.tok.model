item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of the company s financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein 
company overview and industry outlook the company s principal business  which began in  is owning and franchising krispy kreme doughnut stores which make and sell over varieties of high quality doughnuts  including the company s hot original glazed tm 
each of the company s traditional factory stores has a doughnut making production line and the capacity to produce from  dozen to over  dozen doughnuts daily 
consequently  each factory store has significant fixed or semi fixed costs  and margins and profitability are significantly affected by doughnut production volume and sales 
factory stores are versatile in that most can support multiple sales channels to more fully utilize production capacity 
these sales channels are comprised of on premises sales 
sales to customers visiting company and franchise factory and satellite stores  including the drive through windows  along with discounted sales to community organizations that in turn sell doughnuts for fundraising purposes 
off premises sales 
daily sales of fresh doughnuts primarily on a branded basis to a variety of retail customers  such as convenience stores  grocery stores mass merchants and other food service and institutional accounts 
doughnuts are sold to these customers on trays for display and sale in glass enclosed cases and in packages for display and sale on both stand alone display units and on customers shelves 
in addition  the company also sells branded packaged coffee and other products to select convenience stores  grocery stores and mass merchants 
the company is vertically integrated to help maintain the consistency and quality of products throughout the krispy kreme system 
in addition  through vertical integration  the company utilizes volume buying power  which the company believes helps lower the cost of supplies to stores and enhances profitability 
the supply chain business unit  kk supply chain  produces doughnut mixes and manufactures doughnut making equipment  which all factory stores are required to purchase 
additionally  this business unit operates three distribution centers that are capable of supplying domestic stores and certain international stores with key supplies 
this business unit is volume driven  and its economics are enhanced by the opening of new stores and the growth of sales by existing stores 
the company s stores include factory stores and satellite stores 
traditional factory stores have the capacity to produce from  dozen to over  dozen doughnuts daily 
commissaries  which are production facilities used principally to serve off premises customers domestically and to supplement factory stores focused on on premises sales internationally  have the highest production capacities of factory stores 
as of january   there were commissaries systemwide  six of which were operated by the company 
other factory stores often engage in both on premises and off premises sales  with the allocation between such channels dependent on the particular capacity of the store 
the company has begun introducing internationally  and on a test basis domestically  a store concept that utilizes doughnut making technology scaled to accommodate principally on premises sales in a store approximately one half the size of a traditional factory store 
satellite stores consist primarily of the hot shop  fresh shop and kiosk formats 
hot shops contain doughnut heating technology that allows customers to have a hot doughnut experience throughout the day 
fresh shops and free standing kiosks are locations that do not contain doughnut heating technology 
in each of these formats  the company typically sells fresh doughnuts and beverages  with the doughnuts supplied by nearby factory stores 
each of these formats requires less space than a traditional factory store 
the company began tests of the fresh shop concept during fiscal and tests of the hot shop and kiosk formats in fiscal as of january   fresh shops  hot shops and kiosks were open 
the company views the fresh shop  hot shop and kiosk formats as additional ways to achieve market penetration in a variety of market sizes and settings 
as of january   there were krispy kreme factory stores  consisting of company stores  area developer franchise stores including owned by franchisees in which the company had a minority equity interest and associate franchise stores 
the company is working to stabilize its operations and to refine its store format for new domestic factory stores  and does not expect that the company or its franchisees will open a significant number of domestic factory stores in the near future 
like other retail and restaurant companies  the company constantly evaluates the performance of its stores and from time to time decides to close locations whose performance no longer meets company standards 
markets outside the united states are a potential source of growth  and the company is hiring additional personnel to assist in the development of international markets 
as of january   there were a total of krispy kreme stores including satellites operated internationally  which were located in australia  canada  hong kong  indonesia  japan  kuwait  mexico  the philippines  south korea and the united kingdom 
the company owned six of the canadian stores and had an equity interest in the franchisees operating stores in mexico and western canada 
the company currently does not expect to own equity interests in international area developers formed in the future 
based on continued research and experience with international stores  the company is focusing international development efforts primarily on opportunities in potential markets in asia and the middle east 
during fiscal  the company awarded development rights in the middle east  hong kong  macau  tokyo  the philippines and indonesia 
the development and franchise agreements for these territories provide for the development of approximately stores  including both factory stores and satellites  over the next five years 
as of january   stores have been opened under these new agreements 
the company is hiring personnel to assist in the development of international markets 
the domestic doughnut market is comprised of several sales channels including retail  grocery store packaged  in store bakeries within grocery stores  convenience stores  business and institutional  fundraising and vending 
comprehensive  reliable doughnut industry statistics are not readily available  however  with regard to specific sales channels within the industry  data are available 
information resources  inc data indicate that  during calendar  packaged and in store bakery doughnut sales through domestic grocery stores decreased and sales through domestic convenience stores increased

company stores revenues decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in revenues reflects a decrease in store operating weeks  partially offset by a increase in average weekly sales per store 
the decrease in store operating weeks reflects the significant number of factory stores sold or closed since the end of fiscal the increase in the average weekly sales per store reflects  among other things  the closure of relatively poorer performing locations  the benefits of consolidating production for wholesale customers into a smaller number of factory stores  the effects of certain price increases implemented late in the second quarter of fiscal on products sold through certain off premises distribution channels  and improved sales volume through convenience store outlets  partially offset by lower volumes through the grocery store and mass merchant channels 
franchise revenues 
franchise revenues  consisting principally of franchise fees and royalties  increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal franchisee fees rose approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal  of which approximately  represents revenue arising from amendments to agreements with certain international franchisees 
the development and franchise agreements with these franchisees contemplated development only of factory stores  and were amended to provide for initial franchise fees for satellite stores and to provide for development of satellite stores to be partially creditable against the franchisees store development obligations 
the company did not record initial franchisee fees related to these franchisees satellite stores until the company agreed with the franchisees on the amount of initial franchise fee to be paid with respect to these stores 
the balance of the increase in franchise fees principally reflects an increase in new store openings in fiscal compared to fiscal in addition  royalty revenues rose to million in fiscal from million in fiscal while sales by franchise stores fell to approximately million in fiscal compared to approximately million in fiscal  the resolution of disputes with two major franchisees substantially eliminated collectibility concerns with respect to royalties accruing on sales by these franchisees during fiscal the amount of royalty revenue not recognized during fiscal due to collectibility concerns fell to approximately million from approximately million in fiscal kk supply chain revenues 
kk supply chain sales to franchise stores decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the most significant reason for the decrease in revenues was lower sales by franchisees  which resulted in an approximate decrease in sales of mixes  icings and fillings  sugar  shortening  coffee and supplies by kk supply chain 
in addition  an increasing percentage of franchisee sales is attributable to sales by franchisees outside north america  while the company sells the doughnut mixes used by such franchisees  many of the other ingredients and supplies used by these franchisees are acquired locally instead of from kk supply chain 
the decline in sales of mixes and other supplies was partially offset by a increase in sales of equipment and equipment services in fiscal compared to fiscal  principally as a result of increased store expansion by franchisees in fiscal franchisees opened new factory stores in fiscal compared to in fiscal sales of equipment and related services including signage  beverage equipment  furniture  fixtures and similar items sold through the kk supply chain distribution centers represented approximately and of kk supply chain revenues in fiscal and  respectively

many store operating costs are fixed or semi fixed in nature and  accordingly  store profit margins are sensitive to changes in sales volumes 
company stores direct operating expenses for fiscal include a charge of approximately million recorded in the fourth quarter related to the proposed settlement of claims alleging violation of wage and hour laws by the company

franchise direct operating expenses include costs to recruit new franchisees  to assist in store openings  and to monitor and aid in the performance of franchise stores  as well as direct general and administrative expenses and allocated corporate costs

increased costs associated with recruitment and development of international franchisees were offset by a reduction in costs associated with domestic franchise expansion 
kk supply chain direct operating expenses 
kk supply chain direct operating expenses as a percentage of kk supply chain revenues were in fiscal compared with in fiscal the improvement reflects the benefit of certain price increases instituted in the first quarter of fiscal to offset higher costs  as well as lower bad debt provisions and lower allocated corporate costs in fiscal compared to fiscal kk supply chain direct operating expenses include bad debt provisions relating to receivables from franchisees of approximately million in fiscal of which approximately million was recorded in the fourth quarter and million for fiscal these improvements were partially offset by the adverse effects of lower operating levels in fiscal compared to fiscal resulting from lower revenue levels and by increases in the cost of certain ingredients 
in fiscal  kk supply chain was adversely affected by increases in certain raw materials costs  including the cost of flour and soybean oil 
the prices of these materials and the products from which they are made were volatile in fiscal and reached record highs during the year 
the company s operating plans assume that prices of these ingredients will remain at levels above historical averages in fiscal the company has been responding to these higher costs by raising prices to its customers and by seeking offsetting cost reductions elsewhere in the business

provision for income taxes benefit the provision for income taxes on continuing operations was a benefit of  in fiscal the provision includes adjustments to the valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets to maintain such allowance at an amount sufficient to reduce the company s aggregate net deferred income tax assets to zero  as well as a provision for taxes estimated to be payable currently 
since the third quarter of fiscal  the valuation allowance has been maintained in an amount sufficient to reduce the company s net deferred income tax asset to zero because management is unable to conclude  in light of the cumulative losses realized by the company  that realization of the net deferred income tax asset is more likely than not 
the provision for income taxes for fiscal also includes an out of period credit of approximately million 
this credit corrects an overstatement of the valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets recorded by a charge to earnings in fiscal the company concluded that this error was not material to the consolidated financial statements of the affected periods or to the fiscal consolidated financial statements

in addition  fiscal and results include non cash charges of million and million  respectively  related to the settlement of certain litigation described in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
the company has experienced a decline in revenues in each of the last three fiscal years  which reflects fewer company stores in operation  a decline in average sales per store in fiscal and  and a decline in royalty revenues and in sales of mixes and ingredients resulting from lower sales by the company s franchisees 
lower revenues have adversely affected operating margins because of the fixed or semi fixed nature of many of the company s direct operating expenses 
some measures of the company s performance improved in fiscal average weekly sales per company store rose  and cash provided by operating activities increased to million from million in fiscal in addition  during fiscal the company reduced its outstanding indebtedness from million to million  reduced the amount of its guarantee obligations from million to million  and increased its cash balance from million to million 
a number of events have occurred since the end of the company s third fiscal quarter on october  among the more significant events were the final settlement of the securities class action and most elements of the shareholder derivative action and the final settlement of the erisa class action  each of which is described in note to the consolidated finacial statements appearing elsewhere herein  which also describes unresolved contingencies facing the company 
in addition  on february   the company entered into the secured credit facilities described in note to the consolidated financial statements  which provide the company with a million term loan maturing in fiscal and a million revolving credit facility maturing in fiscal the company used the proceeds of the secured credit facilities to retire the company s secured credit facilities  which were then terminated 
the rate of interest payable by the company under the secured credit facilities currently is approximately per annum less than the rate of interest paid by the company during fiscal on the secured credit facilities  the term loan portion of which was scheduled to mature in april the financial covenants contained in the secured credit facilities are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these covenants contemplate continued improvement in cash flow from operating activities and debt service coverage  as well as reduced financial leverage  over the term of the facilities 
management s operating plans for fiscal have been designed to achieve those goals  including compliance with the facilities financial covenants 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s financial condition and results of operations will continue to improve 
capital resources  contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements in addition to cash flow generated from operations  the company utilizes other capital resources and financing arrangements to fund its business 
these other resources and arrangements have assumed increased importance in light of the substantially reduced cash flows provided by operations 
a discussion of these capital resources and financing techniques is included below 
debt the company continuously monitors its funding requirements for general working capital purposes and other financing and investing activities 
in fiscal  the company also provided financing to consolidated franchisees 
in fiscal and  management focused on reducing or eliminating the company s investments in franchisees and the related guarantees of franchisees obligations  and on restructuring the company s borrowing arrangements to make additional credit available to the company to facilitate accomplishing the company s business restructuring initiatives 
on february   the company closed new secured credit facilities totaling million the secured credit facilities 
the facilities consist of a million revolving credit facility maturing february the revolver and a million term loan facility maturing february the term loan 
the secured credit facilities are secured by a first lien on substantially all of the assets of the company and its domestic subsidiaries 
at closing  the company borrowed the full million available under the term loan  and used the proceeds to retire approximately million of indebtedness outstanding under the secured credit facilities described below which were then terminated  to pay prepayment premiums under the secured credit facilities and to pay fees and expenses associated with the secured credit facilities 
the company will record a pretax charge of approximately million in the first quarter of fiscal  representing the prepayment premium related to the secured credit facilities and the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs related to those facilities 
the revolver contains provisions which permit the company to obtain letters of credit 
issuance of letters of credit under these provisions constitutes usage of the lending commitments  and the amount of such letters of credit approximately million as of january  reduces the amount available for cash borrowings under the related revolver 
the company s outstanding letters of credit under the secured credit facilities were rolled into the secured credit facilities 
interest on borrowings under the revolver is payable either at libor or at the alternate base rate which is the greater of fed funds rate plus or the prime rate  in each case plus the applicable margin 
the applicable margin for libor based loans is and for alternate base rate based loans is  in each case subject to reduction if the company achieves certain credit ratings on or before august  in addition  the company is required to pay a fee equal to the applicable margin for libor based loans on the outstanding amount of letters of credit issued under the revolver  as well as a fronting fee of of the amount of such letter of credit payable to the letter of credit issuer 
there also is a fee of subject to a reduction to based on the achievement of a specified leverage ratio on the unused portion of the revolver lending commitment 
interest on the outstanding balance of the term loan accrues either at libor or at the alternate base rate plus  in each case  the applicable margin 
the applicable margin for libor based loans is and for alternate base rate based loans is  in each case subject to reduction if the company achieves certain credit ratings on or before august  borrowings under the revolver and issuances of letters of credit are subject to the satisfaction of usual and customary conditions  including accuracy of representations and warranties and the absence of defaults 
the term loan is payable in equal quarterly installments of  beginning april and a final installment equal to the remaining principal balance in february the term loan is required to be repaid with the net proceeds of certain equity issuances  debt incurrences  asset sales and casualty events and with a percentage of excess cash flow as defined in the agreement on an annual basis 
the secured credit facilities require the company to meet certain financial tests  including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio expressed as a ratio of total debt to consolidated ebitda and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio expressed as a ratio of consolidated ebitda to net interest expense  computed based upon consolidated ebitda and net interest expense for the most recent four fiscal quarters and total debt as of the end of such four quarter period 
for the first quarter of fiscal  these tests were set at to  in the case of the consolidated leverage ratio  and to  in the case of the consolidated interest coverage ratio 
as of january   the company s consolidated leverage ratio was approximately to and the company s consolidated interest coverage ratio was approximately to  in each case computed on a pro forma basis assuming that the credit facilities had been refinanced with the credit facilities as of that date 
the maximum consolidated leverage ratio for periods after the first quarter of fiscal declines over time until it reaches to in fiscal  and the minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio increases over time until it reaches to in fiscal consolidated ebitda is a non gaap measure and is defined in the secured credit facilities to mean  generally  consolidated net income or loss  exclusive of unrealized gains and losses on hedging instruments and gains or losses on the early extinguishment of debt  plus the sum of net interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  non cash charges  store closure costs  costs associated with certain litigation and investigations  and extraordinary professional fees  and minus the sum of non cash credits 
in addition  the secured credit facilities contain other covenants which  among other things  limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness including guarantees  liens  investments including investments in and advances to franchisees which own and operate krispy kreme stores  dividends  transactions with affiliates  asset sales  acquisitions  capital expenditures  mergers and consolidations  prepayments of other indebtedness and other activities customarily restricted in such agreements 
the secured credit facilities also prohibit the transfer of cash or other assets to kkdi from its subsidiaries  whether by dividend  loan or otherwise  but provide for exceptions to enable kkdi to pay taxes and operating expenses and certain judgment and settlement costs 
the operation of the restrictive financial covenants described above may limit the amount the company may borrow under the revolver 
in addition  the maximum amount which may be borrowed under the revolver is reduced by the amount of outstanding letters of credit  of which approximately million were outstanding as of january  the maximum additional borrowing available to the company as of january   computed on a pro forma basis assuming that the secured credit facilities had been refinanced with the secured credit facilities as of that date  was approximately million 
such amount reflects the effects of application of the restrictive financial covenants described in the preceding paragraph 
the secured credit facilities also contain customary events of default  including without limitation  payment defaults  breaches of representations and warranties  covenant defaults  cross defaults to other indebtedness in excess of million  certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency  judgment defaults in excess of million and the occurrence of a change of control 
the secured credit facilities require the company  on or before may   to enter into hedging agreements acceptable to the lenders to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates with respect to at least of the principal balance of the term loan for a period extending until at least february leases the company conducts some of its operations from leased facilities and leases certain equipment 
generally  these leases have initial terms of three to twenty years and contain provisions for renewal options of five to ten years 
in determining whether to enter into a lease for an asset  the company evaluates the nature of the asset and the associated lease terms to determine if leasing is an effective financing tool 
off balance sheet arrangements the company s only off balance sheet arrangements  as defined by item a of sec regulation s k  consist of the company s guarantees of indebtedness and lease obligations of certain franchisees  as discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein  and certain advancement and potential indemnification obligations also discussed in note contractual cash obligations at january  the company s contractual cash obligations as of january  are as follows payments due in less more than than total amount year years years years in thousands long term debt excluding capital lease obligations  including current maturities    total interest payment obligations     capital lease obligations operating lease obligations      purchase obligations    other long term obligations  including current portion  reflected on the company s balance sheet self insurance claims      lease termination costs  k mirror plan liability total      represents principal payments to be made on long term debt after giving effect to the refinancing of the company s secured credit facilities in february represents estimated interest payments to be made on long term debt  after giving effect to the refinancing of the company s secured credit facilities in february interest rates utilized to estimate interest payments for variable rate debt are based upon the forward libor interest rate curve as of january  represents estimated amounts payable without reduction for any amount due to the company pursuant to an interest rate hedge agreement 
see note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
capital requirements in the next five years  the company plans to use cash primarily for the following activities working capital and other corporate purposes investments in systems and personnel restructuring initiatives remodeling and relocation of selected older company stores opening new company stores in selected markets the company s capital requirements for these activities may be significant 
these capital requirements will depend on many factors including the company s overall performance  the pace of store expansion and company store remodels and infrastructure needs for both personnel and facilities 
these capital outlays are subject to limitations contained in the secured credit facilities 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its results of operations in recent years 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures  including disclosures of contingencies and uncertainties 
gaap provides the framework from which to make these estimates  assumptions and disclosures 
the company chooses accounting policies within gaap that management believes are appropriate to accurately and fairly report the company s operating results and financial position in a consistent manner 
management regularly assesses these policies in light of changes in facts and circumstances and discusses the selection of accounting policies and significant accounting judgments with the audit committee of the board of directors 
the company believes that application of the following accounting policies involves judgments and estimates that are among the more significant used in the preparation of the financial statements  and that an understanding of these policies is important to understanding the company s financial condition and results of operations 
basis of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of kkdi and all subsidiaries where voting control rests with the company and  from time to time  has consolidated the accounts of certain franchisees that are variable interest entities and with respect to which the company has determined that variable interests owned by the company absorb a majority of each entity s expected losses  expected residual returns  or both  as each of these terms is defined in financial accounting interpretation no 
revised  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r 
investments in franchisees over which the company has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies  and whose financial statements are not required to be consolidated under fin r  are accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
management s judgments regarding the company s level of influence or control over each franchisee in which it has an investment and the extent to which variable interests owned by the company absorb a majority of the franchisee s expected losses or expected residual returns affect management s decisions about which investments are consolidated and which are accounted for using the equity method 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable arise primarily from royalties earned on sales by the company s franchisees  sales by kk supply chain to our franchisees of equipment  mix  coffee and other supplies necessary to operate a krispy kreme store  as well as from off premises sales by company stores to convenience and grocery stores and other customers 
during the three years in the period ended january   some of the company s franchisees experienced financial difficulties or for other reasons did not comply with the normal payment terms for settlement of amounts due to the company 
the company has recorded provisions for doubtful accounts related to its accounts receivable  including receivables from franchisees  in amounts which management believes are sufficient to provide for losses estimated to be sustained on realization of these receivables 
such estimates inherently involve uncertainties and assessments of the outcome of future events  and changes in facts and circumstances may result in adjustments to the provision for doubtful accounts 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets fas  goodwill and other intangible assets fas  addresses the accounting and reporting of goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
fas requires intangible assets with definite lives to be amortized over their estimated useful lives  while those with indefinite lives and goodwill are not subject to amortization but must be tested annually for impairment  or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate potential impairment 
goodwill arose principally from acquisitions of franchisees and from the acquisition of montana mills in fiscal identifiable intangible assets include the value assigned to recipes and reacquired franchise rights recorded in connection with franchise acquisitions 
reacquired franchise rights were determined to have indefinite lives based upon the long operating history of the company s brand and its franchise model  and the company s ability to enfranchise these markets 
all of the intangibles associated with montana mills were written off in fiscal when the company decided to discontinue the montana mills operation 
for intangible assets with indefinite lives  the company performs the annual test for impairment as of december the impairment test involves determining the fair values of the reporting units to which goodwill is assigned and comparing those fair values to the reporting units carrying values  including goodwill 
to determine fair value for each reporting unit  the company uses the fair value of the cash flows that the reporting unit can be expected to generate in the future 
this valuation method requires management to project revenues  operating expenses  working capital investment  capital spending and cash flows for the reporting units over a multiyear period  as well as determine the weighted average cost of capital to be used as a discount rate 
significant management judgment is involved in preparing these estimates 
changes in projections or estimates could significantly change the estimated fair value of reporting units and affect the recorded balances of goodwill 
in addition  if management uses different assumptions or estimates in the future or if conditions exist in future periods that are different than those anticipated  future operating results and the balances of goodwill in the future could be affected by impairment charges 
impairment analyses of goodwill in fiscal  and resulted in impairment charges of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
as of january   the remaining goodwill had a carrying value of million 
asset impairment when an asset group typically a store is identified as underperforming or when a decision is made to abandon an asset group or to close a store  the company makes an assessment of the potential impairment of the related assets 
the assessment is based upon a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets  primarily property and equipment  to the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from those assets 
to estimate cash flows  management projects the net cash flows anticipated from continuing operation of the asset group or store until its closing or abandonment  as well as cash flows  if any  anticipated from disposal of the related assets 
if the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows  the company records an impairment charge in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying value of the assets over their estimated fair value 
determining undiscounted cash flows and the fair value of an asset group involves estimating future cash flows  revenues  operating expenses and disposal values 
the projections of these amounts represent management s best estimates at the time of the review 
if different cash flows had been estimated  property and equipment balances and related impairment charges could have been affected 
further  if management uses different assumptions or estimates in the future or if conditions exist in future periods that are different than those anticipated  future operating results could be affected 
in fiscal  and  the company recorded impairment charges related to long lived assets totaling approximately million  million and million  respectively 
additional impairment charges may be reflected in years after fiscal related to store closure decisions made in such years 
insurance the company is subject to workers compensation  vehicle and general liability claims 
the company is self insured for the cost of all workers compensation  vehicle and general liability claims up to the amount of stop loss insurance coverage purchased by the company from commercial insurance carriers 
the company maintains accruals for these self insurance costs  the amounts of which are determined using actuarial methods which evaluate open claims and take into consideration estimated ongoing loss development exposure 
many estimates and assumptions are involved in estimating future claims  and differences between future events and prior estimates and assumptions could affect future operating results and result in adjustments to these liabilities 
income taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon management s expectation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the income tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized for which payment has been deferred  or expenses which already have been deducted in the company s tax return but which have not yet been recognized as an expense in the consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax assets generally represent tax deductions or credits that will be reflected in future tax returns for which the company has already recorded a tax benefit in its consolidated financial statements 
the company establishes valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets as required under fas  accounting for income taxes 
at january   the company has recorded a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets of million  representing the total amount of such assets in excess of the company s deferred income tax liabilities 
the valuation allowance was recorded because management was unable to conclude  in light of the cumulative losses realized by the company that realization of the net deferred income tax asset was more likely than not 
the determination of income tax expense and the related balance sheet accounts  including valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets  requires management to make estimates and assumptions regarding future events  including future operating results and the outcome of tax related contingencies 
if future events are different from those assumed or anticipated  the amount of income tax assets and liabilities  including valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets  could be materially affected 
guarantee liabilities the company has guaranteed a portion of loan and lease obligations of certain franchisees in which the company owns an interest 
to the extent such guarantees relate to franchisees whose financial statements are consolidated with those of the company  the guaranteed indebtedness is included in the company s consolidated balance sheet and the guaranteed lease obligations are included in the disclosure of the company s lease obligations 
for guarantees related to franchisees accounted for using the equity method  the company assesses the likelihood of making any payments under the guarantees and records liabilities for the present value of any anticipated payments 
no liability for the guarantees related to equity method franchisees was recorded at the time they were issued because the company believed the value of the guarantees was immaterial 
as of january   the company has recorded liabilities of approximately  related to such guarantees  which totaled approximately million at that date 
assessing the probability of future guarantee payments involves estimates and assumptions regarding future events  including the future operating results of the franchisees 
if future events are different from those assumed or anticipated  the amounts estimated to be paid pursuant to such guarantees could change  and additional provisions to record such liabilities could be required 
investments in franchisees the company has investments in certain equity method franchisees 
while the company believes that the recorded amounts of such investments are realizable  these franchisees typically are startup businesses without a history of successful operations  and the value of the company s investments in the franchisees cannot be verified by reference to quoted market prices 
the company s assessment of the realizability of these investments involves assumptions concerning future events  including the future operating results of the franchisees 
if future events are different from those assumed or anticipated by the company  the assessment of realizability of the recorded investments in these entities could change  and impairment provisions related to these investments could be required 
as of january   the company s investment in equity method franchisees was approximately million 
stock based compensation in the first quarter of fiscal  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  which requires that stock awards  including stock options  granted to employees and which ultimately vest be recognized as compensation expense based on their fair value at the grant date 
because options granted to employees differ from options on the company s common shares traded in the financial markets  the company cannot determine the fair value of options granted to employees based on observed market prices 
accordingly  the company estimates the fair value of stock options subject only to service conditions using the black scholes option valuation model  which requires inputs including interest rates  expected dividends  volatility measures and employee exercise behavior patterns 
some of the inputs the company uses are not market observable and must be estimated 
the fair value of stock options which contain market conditions as well as service conditions is estimated using monte carlo simulation techniques 
in addition  the company must estimate the number of awards which ultimately will vest  and periodically adjust such estimates to reflect actual vesting events 
use of different estimates and assumptions would produce different option values  which in turn would affect the amount of compensation expense recognized 
the black scholes model is capable of considering the specific features included in the options granted to the company s employees that are subject only to service conditions 
however  there are other models which could be used to estimate their fair value  and techniques other than monte carlo simulation could be used to estimate the value of stock options which are subject to both service and market conditions 
if the company were to use different models  the option values would differ despite using the same inputs 
accordingly  using different assumptions coupled with using different valuation models could have a significant impact on the fair value of employee stock options 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
fas 
fas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings 
fas does not affect any existing accounting literature that requires certain assets and liabilities to be carried at fair value 
fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  management currently does not expect adoption of fas will have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements fas  which addresses how companies should measure fair value when they are required to use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes under gaap 
as a result of fas  there is now a common definition of fair value to be used throughout gaap  which is expected to make the measurement of fair value more consistent and comparable 
the company must adopt fas in fiscal  but has not yet begun to evaluate the effects  if any  of adoption on its consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb released fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure of income tax uncertainties with respect to positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns 
the company must adopt fin in the first quarter of fiscal any difference in the liability for uncertain tax positions computed as of the first day of fiscal under the provisions of fin and the amount of such liability reflected in the accompanying balance sheet as of january  will be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit for fiscal management currently is evaluating the effects on the company s consolidated financial statements of adoption of fin while management has not completed that evaluation  management currently does not expect adoption of fin will have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued statement no 
 inventory costs fas  which amends the guidance in accounting research bulletin no 
 inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage 
fas requires that those items be recognized as current period charges and that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the cost of converting work in process to finished goods be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the company adopted fas in the first quarter of fiscal  but adoption had no material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections fas to replace accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting changes apb and fas  reporting accounting changes in interim periods 
fas provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections  and establishes retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle 
fas provides guidance for determining whether retrospective application of a change in accounting principle is impracticable  and for reporting a change when retrospective application is determined to be impracticable 
fas also addresses the reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously issued financial statements 
the company adopted fas in the first quarter of fiscal  but adoption had no effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
the company is exposed to market risk from increases in interest rates on its outstanding debt 
all of the borrowings under the company s secured credit facilities bear interest at variable rates based upon either the prime rate  the fed funds rate or libor 
the company has entered into an interest rate derivative contract having a notional principal amount of million which eliminates the company s exposure  with respect to such notional amount  to increases in three month libor beyond through april  from may through april and from may through march the interest cost of the company s debt is affected by changes in short term interest rates and increases in those rates adversely affect the company s results of operations 
as of january   the company had approximately million in borrowings outstanding 
a hypothetical increase of basis points in short term interest rates would result in an increase in the company s annual interest expense of approximately  after giving effect to additional payments due to the company from the interest rate hedge described above 
because the substantial majority of the company s revenue  expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in united states dollars  the exposure to foreign currency exchange risk historically has been minor 
the company s investment in its franchisee operating in mexico and the company s operations in canada expose the company to exchange rate risk 
the company historically has not attempted to hedge these exchange rate risks 
the company is exposed to the effects of commodity price fluctuations on the cost of ingredients of its products  of which flour  sugar  shortening and coffee beans are the most significant 
in order to secure adequate supplies of materials and bring greater stability to the cost of ingredients  the company routinely enters into forward purchase contracts and other purchase arrangements with suppliers 
under the forward purchase contracts  the company commits to purchasing agreed upon quantities of ingredients at agreed upon prices at specified future dates 
the outstanding purchase commitment for these commodities at any point in time typically ranges from three months to two years anticipated requirements  depending on the ingredient 
other purchase arrangements typically are contractual arrangements with vendors for example  with respect to certain beverages and ingredients under which the company is not required to purchase any minimum quantity of goods  but must purchase minimum percentages of its requirements for such goods from these vendors with whom it has executed these contracts 
in addition to entering into forward purchase contracts  from time to time the company purchases exchange traded commodity futures contracts  and options on such contracts  for raw materials which are ingredients of its products or which are components of such ingredients  including wheat  soybean oil and coffee 
the company typically assigns the futures contract to a supplier in connection with entering into a forward purchase contract for the related ingredient

although the company utilizes forward purchase contracts and futures contracts and options on such contracts to mitigate the risks related to commodity price fluctuations  such contracts do not fully mitigate commodity price risk 
in addition  the portion of the company s anticipated future commodity requirements that is subject to such contracts varies from time to time 
recently  prices for wheat and soy have been near all time highs and dairy prices have risen 
continued high prices or further adverse changes in commodity prices that the company cannot fully hedge could adversely affect the company s profitability and liquidity

the range of prices paid for fiscal set forth in the table above reflect the effects of any forward purchase contracts entered into at various times prior to delivery of the goods and  accordingly  do not necessarily reflect the range of prices of these ingredients prevailing in the market during the fiscal year
