table of contents software development costs development costs incurred in the research and development of new software products  and enhancements to existing software products  are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established 
after technological feasibility is established  any additional costs are capitalized in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
such costs are amortized over the lesser of three years or the economic life of the related product 
we perform an annual review of the recoverability of such capitalized software costs 
at the time a determination is made that capitalized amounts are not recoverable based on the estimated cash flows to be generated from the applicable software  any remaining capitalized amounts are expensed 
stock based compensation on january   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment fas r using the modified prospective method 
under this method  compensation cost is recognized beginning january  based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based awards granted after january   and based on the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  for all awards granted to employees prior to january  that remain unvested at january  we used the black scholes option valuation model to calculate the fair value of stock options granted prior to january  prior to january   we accounted for stock based compensation in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no

and eitf for stock options granted to non employees 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  requires disclosure of compensation expense under both apb no 
and sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets we have obtained a third party valuation of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired in the clickfind acquisition 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is deemed to have an indefinite life and is not amortized but is subject to an impairment test at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
we performed an initial annual goodwill and other intangible assets impairment test as of october  for purposes of impairment testing  we determined that we have one reporting unit 
we compared the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value at october   and therefore goodwill and other intangible assets was not deemed to be impaired as of the impairment testing date 
income taxes we follow sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this accounting standard requires that the liability method be used in accounting for income taxes 
under this accounting method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that apply in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets for which realization currently is not certain 
quarterly income taxes are recorded at the effective rate  based on annual forecasted income

in connection with the agreement executed by the parties  we will grant registration rights for the purchased common shares and the common shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants 
closing of the private placement is dependent upon the satisfaction of customary terms and conditions 
contracts with our customers usually require a portion of the contract amount to be paid at the time the contract is initiated 
additional payments are generally received monthly as work on the contract progresses 
we record all amounts received as a liability deferred revenue until work has been completed and revenue is recognized 
cash receipts do not necessarily correspond to costs incurred or revenue recognized 
we typically receive a low volume of large dollar receipts 
our accounts receivable will fluctuate due to the timing and size of cash receipts 
our contracting and collection practices are designed to maintain an average collection period for accounts receivable of one to three months 
any increase in our normal collection period for accounts receivable will negatively impact our cash flow from operations and our working capital

we are party to a lease agreement that requires us to maintain a restricted cash balance 
our restricted cash balance was  at december  we have established two lines of credit with two separate banks 
one of the lines allows us to borrow up to a certain percentage of our investments  as determined by the type of investment  held at the bank 
the line of credit bears interest at rates based on the prime rate  and is payable on demand 
the other line of credit allows us to borrow up to  at an interest rate equal to the prime rate minus basis points for us dollar borrowings and the euro dollar rate plus basis points for euro borrowings  payable on demand

however  we may need to raise additional funds to offset delays or cancellations of contacts  support expansion  respond to competitive pressures  acquire complementary businesses or technology or take advantage of unanticipated opportunities 
we may raise additional funds by selling debt or equity securities  by entering into strategic relationships or through other arrangements 
additional capital may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
to the extent that additional equity capital is raised  it could have a dilutive effect on our existing shareholders 
contractual obligations the table below shows our contractual cash obligations  expressed in thousands  at december  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating leases debt obligations total contractual cash obligations our february   acquisition of clickfind resulted in  in debt obligations that are scheduled to be paid in installments of   and  on february   and  respectively

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates since we fund our operations through short term investments and have business transactions in euros 
a summary of our primary market risk exposures is presented below 
interest rate risk we have fixed income investments consisting of cash equivalents and short term investments  and short and long term notes payable which may be affected by changes in market interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our cash equivalents and short term investments with high quality financial institutions  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one institution and have established investment guidelines relative to diversification and maturities designed to maintain safety and liquidity 
investments are reported at amortized cost  which approximates fair value 
a change in interest rates during the year ended december  would have resulted in a  change in our interest income during the year 
the clickfind notes bear interest at prime plus  and interest is paid quarterly 
a change in the prime rate during the year ended december  would have resulted in a  change in our interest expense during the year 
foreign currency risk our foreign results of operations are subject to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations through both foreign currency transaction and foreign currency translation adjustments 
we manage our risk to foreign currency transaction adjustments by maintaining foreign currency bank accounts in currencies in which we regularly transact business 
we do not currently hedge against the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
our financial position and results of operations are impacted by translation adjustments caused by the conversion of foreign currency accounts and operating results into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
a fluctuation in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro at december  would have resulted in a  change in the foreign currency translation amount recorded on our balance sheet  due to foreign currency translations 
a fluctuation in the average exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro for the year ended december  would have resulted in a  change in our net income for the year ended december   due to foreign currency transactions 
during the average exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar increased by approximately 
the conversion of our foreign operations into us dollars upon consolidation resulted in net loss that was approximately  higher than would have been recorded had the exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar remained consistent with rates
