the internal review identified administrative items that were non material errors of approximately million in stock based compensation expense for certain prior periods 
the fiscal financial results reflect the adjustment of million to operating expense and million to discontinued operations 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the selected financial data for the five years ended april  reflects the following in accordance with sfas  we ceased amortizing goodwill and wrote off million of goodwill in fiscal in september  we discontinued the development and marketing of our optical switch product  which resulted in a significant decline in the level of optical losses subsequent to that point in time 
we disposed of our optical business in july  which resulted in the financial results from our optical business being reported as a discontinued operation for all periods presented and contributed to our ability to return to positive net income during fiscal following our fiscal return to profitability  we reversed a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets  resulting in a million tax benefit in fiscal following our acquisition of jasomi  we wrote off million of in process r d in fiscal and amortized million and million of acquired intangible assets in fiscal and  respectively 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the discussion in this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
see our cautionary language in the first paragraph of item business regarding these statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
see item a risk factors for factors that could cause future results to differ materially 
overview we design  develop and market telecommunications equipment for use in canceling echo and enhancing voice quality in voice calls over wireline  wireless and internet protocol ip telecommunications networks 
our products monitor and enhance voice quality and provide security in the delivery of voice services 
since entering the voice processing market  we have continued to refine our echo cancellation products to meet the needs of the ever changing telecommunications marketplace 
our more recent product introductions have leveraged the processing capacity of our newer hardware platforms to offer not only echo cancellation but also enhanced vqa features including noise reduction  acoustic echo cancellation  voice level control and noise compensation through enhanced voice intelligibility 
since becoming a public company in june  our financial success has been primarily predicated on the macroeconomic environment of us wireline and  more recently  wireless carriers as well as our success in selling to the larger carriers 
since the beginning of calendar year  large north american telecommunications service providers have engaged in merger and acquisition activity 
this activity largely drove our fiscal revenue decline of as one of our two largest fiscal us customers was involved in post merger integration and  consequently  orders from that customer in fiscal were nominal 
our revenue will continue to be heavily influenced by the buying trends of verizon wireless  our largest customer in fiscal at of our total worldwide revenue 
our revenue also will continue to be primarily generated from sales of our bvp flex  which accounted for of our revenue in fiscal in an attempt to diversify our customer base  beginning in fiscal and throughout fiscal  we added sales and marketing resources to focus on new large account opportunities in the united states 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we signed a contract with one of these large domestic carriers and realized our first revenue shipments 
in the united states  we believe that our continued focus on voice quality in the competitive wireless services landscape and the continued expansion of wireless networks will be key factors in adding new customers and driving our revenue growth 
internationally  we have also added sales resources and invested in customer trials 
the development of our vqa feature set was targeted at the international gsm market 
in fiscal  orascom telecom holding orascom became our largest vqa customer to date 
we were able to add other international customers during fiscal making fiscal our most geographically diverse revenue base and continuing our advancement toward our goal of greater customer diversification 
we continue to focus on international mobile carriers who might best apply our vqa solution 
we expect additional long term opportunities for growth will occur in voip based network deployments as there appears to be a growing trend of service providers transitioning from traditional circuit switched network infrastructure to voip 
we have therefore directed the majority of our r d spending  since the beginning of fiscal  towards the development of our packet voice processor  a new platform targeting voip based network deployments 
the packet voice processor introduces cost effective voice format transcoding capabilities and combines our vqa software and newly developed pqa technology to improve call quality and clarity by eliminating acoustic echo and voice level imbalances and reducing packet loss  delay and jitter 
to further develop a presence in the voip market  we acquired jasomi in june jasomi s currently available peerpoint c session border controller enables voip calls to traverse the nat and protects networks from external attacks by admitting only authorized sessions  ensuring that reliable voip service can be provided to them 
we are continuing to work on the integration of the packet voice processor and session border controller technologies to provide a more comprehensive solution to carriers border services needs 
in fiscal  we have continued to recognize modest revenue from peerpoint and have sold modest levels of our packet voice processor 
exit of optical business 
in may  we announced a change to our strategic direction 
we decided to focus all of our assets in continuing to grow our voice processing business  including our echo cancellation and vqa products  and as a result we decided to sell our optical communications business 
in july  we completed the primary step in our planned exit of our optical communications business through the sale of a large portion of the assets of the optical communications business to jds uniphase corporation jdsu 
the assets sold consisted primarily of inventory  certain specified optical related equipment and intellectual property rights  which were sold for an aggregate purchase price of up to approximately million in cash  of which a approximately million was paid to us at closing  b million to be paid to us one year from the closing subject to reduction in the event any successful indemnification claims are made against us  and c up to an additional million to be paid to us  which is comprised of up to million based on the level of inventory consumed by jdsu  and up to million based on revenues generated by the optical business acquired by jdsu through june   if any 
additionally  jdsu had the right to require us to reimburse jdsu for any purchased but unused inventory at june   up to million  which right expired as of july  jdsu also had indemnification rights in connection with the performance of certain warranty obligations relating to optical products that were sold by us on or prior to july  in fiscal  we recognized million associated with the level of revenue generated by jdsu since the close of the sale 
the proceeds were substantially offset by increased loss accruals associated with exiting our international optical operations and an estimated loss provision associated with our indemnification of the realizable value of the inventory purchased by jdsu 
the net effect of these items was reported as an incremental net loss on disposition of discontinued operations in fiscal of million in the consolidated statement of operations 
in fiscal  income from discontinued operations was due to adjustments needed to reflect actual costs incurred and to recognize a tax benefit due to the release of our valuation reserve 
in june  we and jdsu came to a mutual settlement and release whereby jdsu paid us million and released us from our warranty obligation 
in addition  in june  we completed the closure of our international optical operations 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we have sold or abandoned all of the assets not purchased by jdsu 
as a result of exiting the optical business  our consolidated statements of operations reflect the optical business as a discontinued operation for all periods presented 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
acquisition history 
in the last five fiscal years  we have completed one acquisition 
in june  we acquired jasomi  which developed and sold session border controllers that enable voip calls to traverse the nat and protect networks from external attacks by admitting only authorized sessions  ensuring that reliable voip service can be provided to them 
the integration of our packet voice processor and jasomi s session border control technology may enable ditech to provide a more comprehensive solution to carriers border service needs 
consideration for the acquisition included million in cash  escrow payments  vested options assumed  acquisition costs  and net liabilities assumed plus million in non transferable convertible notes 
the payment of the full million principal amount of the convertible notes is contingent on the retention of a specified number of designated employees and is broken into two tranches 
the conditions of the first tranche were met in june at which point million was paid and reflected as an adjustment to the purchase price 
the second tranche of million was paid in july  after the conditions related to that tranche were met 
the second tranche is not reflected in the purchase price as of april  we additionally issued shares of ditech restricted stock to new employees hired as part of the acquisition 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
our customer base 
historically  the majority of our sales have been to customers in the united states 
these customers accounted for approximately   and of our revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
however  sales to some of our us customers may result in our products purchased by these customers eventually being deployed internationally  especially in the case of any original equipment manufacturer that distributes overseas 
to date  the vast majority of our international sales have been export sales and denominated in us dollars 
we expect that as we expand shipments of our newer voice processing products  which are targeted at gsm networks  international revenue will begin to become a larger percentage of our overall revenue 
our revenue historically has come from a small number of customers 
our largest customer accounted for approximately of our total revenue in fiscal our five largest customers accounted for approximately   and of our revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
consequently  the loss of any one of our largest customers  without an offsetting increase in revenue from existing or new customers  would have a negative and substantial effect on our business 
this customer concentration risk was evidenced in fiscal as revenue was approximately of our fiscal revenue primarily due to a lack of orders from one of our two largest fiscal customers 
this caused fiscal to result in a net loss 
critical accounting policies and estimates 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosures 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to our revenue  allowance for bad debts  provisions for inventories  warranties and recovery of deferred income taxes 
estimates are based on our historical experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual future results may differ from these estimates in the event that facts and circumstances vary from our expectations 
to the extent there are material differences between our ongoing estimates and the ultimate actual results  our future results of operations will be affected 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition in applying our revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts policies  the level of judgment is generally relatively limited  as the vast majority of our revenue has been generated by a handful of customers 
these customers are some of the largest wire line and wireless carriers in the united states and our relationships with them are documented in contracts  which clearly highlight potential revenue recognition issues  such as passage of title and risk of loss 
as of april   we had deferred million of revenue 
to the extent that we have received cash for some or all of a given deferred revenue transaction  we reported it on the consolidated balance sheet as a deferred revenue liability 
however  to the extent that we have not collected cash related to the deferred revenue transaction  we reflect the deferred revenue as a reduction in the corresponding account receivable balance 
of the million of revenue deferred as of april   million related to deferrals associated primarily with installations and million was associated with maintenance contracts 
in dealing with smaller customers  we closely evaluate the credit risk of these customers 
in those cases where credit risk is deemed to be high  we either mitigate the risk by having the customer post a letter of credit  which we can draw against on a specified date to effectively provide reasonable assurance of collection  or we defer the revenue until customer payment is received 
investments investment securities that have maturities of more than three months at the date of purchase but remaining maturities of less than one year and auction rate securities  which we are able to liquidate on or day auction cycles  we consider short term investments 
we consider other investment securities with remaining maturities of one year or more as long term investments 
short term investments currently consist primarily of corporate bonds and asset backed securities 
we have classified our short term and long term investments as available for sale securities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we carry available for sale securities at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported in a separate component of stockholders equity 
we include realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary  if any  on available for sale securities in other income based on specific identification 
we include interest on securities classified as available for sale in interest income 
inventory valuation in conjunction with our ongoing analysis of inventory valuation  we are constantly monitoring projected demand on a product by product basis 
based on these projections we evaluate the levels of allowances required both for inventory on hand  as well as inventory on order from our contract manufacturer 
although we believe we have been reasonably successful in identifying allowance requirements in a timely manner  sudden changes in future buying patterns from our customers  either due to a shift in product interest and or a complete pull back from their expected order levels could result in some larger than anticipated write downs being recognized  such as the oc write down recorded in fiscal for the oc write down  the complete pull back from the forecasted demand by the primary customer for this product resulted in a million write down of the oc inventory 
however  beginning in  the addition of a few large new customers helped to utilize a large portion of the inventory which had been written down and we consequently sold million and million of written down oc inventory in fiscal and  respectively 
we sold no additional oc inventory in fiscal  or however  we sold million  million and million of other previously written down inventory in fiscal  and  respectively 
fiscal sales of previously written down inventory had a negligible impact on the fiscal gross margin as we sold the inventory for approximately its net book value 
goodwill our methodology for allocating a portion of the purchase price to goodwill in connection with the purchase of jasomi was based on established valuation techniques in the high technology communications equipment industry 
we measure goodwill as the excess of the cost of acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired  less liabilities assumed 
we do not amortize goodwill 
the goodwill recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as of april  was million 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets  including goodwill  on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment arise 
following the criteria of sfas disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information and sfas goodwill and other intangible assets  we view ditech as having a single operating segment and consequently have evaluated goodwill and purchased intangible assets for impairment based on an evaluation of the fair value of ditech as a whole 
ditech s quoted share price from nasdaq is the basis for measurement of that fair value as ditech s market capitalization based on share price best represents the amount at which ditech could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
we evaluate the recoverability of our amortizable purchased intangible assets based on an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows resulting from the use of the related asset group and its eventual disposition 
the asset group represents the lowest level for which cash flows are largely independent of cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
we base measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets that we expect to hold and use on the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the asset 
we report long lived assets to be disposed of at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
accounting for stock based compensation on may   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options  restricted stock  restricted stock units rsus and employee stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan based on estimated fair values 
sfas r supersedes the previous accounting under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  as allowed under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
in march  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab relating to sfas r  which provided further guidance related to the application of sfas r for public companies 
we have applied the provisions of sab in conjunction with our adoption of sfas r 
cost of warranty at the time that we recognize revenue  we accrue for the estimated costs of the warranty we offer on our products 
we currently offer hardware warranties on our products ranging from two to five years and one year software warranties 
the warranty generally provides that we will repair or replace any defective product and provide software bug fixes within the term of the warranty 
we base our accrual for the estimated warranty on our historical experience and expectations of future conditions 
to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  we may revise our estimated warranty accrual to reflect these additional exposures  which would result in a decrease in gross profits 
as of april   we had recorded million of accruals related to estimated future warranty costs 
in general  we have been able to closely estimate the level of warranty exposure on our products  and the level of adjustment required to the reserve has been relatively insignificant  except for the last two fiscal years wherein we have reversed warranty accruals established in prior years due either to a contractual release from our warranty obligation of million associated with changes in estimates attributable to exiting our optical business  which was reported as an adjustment to discontinued operations in fiscal  or due to a customer electing not to pursue a recall of a potentially defective component in fiscal  resulting in a million reversal 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
accounting for income taxes we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and certain other foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are certain transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we establish reserves for tax related uncertainties based on estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes and interest will be due 
we establish these reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and may not be fully sustained on review by tax authorities 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
although we believe our reserves are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  these differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that we consider appropriate  as well as the related net interest 
significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available evidence including past operating results  estimates of future taxable income  and the feasibility of tax planning strategies 
currently  we do not have a valuation allowance on any of our deferred tax assets see the discussion on tax net operating losses and research credit carryforward amounts 
in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized  we will establish a valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
we estimate our actual current tax exposure together with our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as valuation allowances for bad debts and inventory  for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences  in conjunction with net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
of our million deferred tax assets at april   million and million  respectively  are associated with net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the remaining million of deferred tax assets are associated with temporary differences 
at least once per quarter  we assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is no longer more likely than not  we establish a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
on an annual basis  or more frequently if warranted by adverse changes in our business  we review income projections to ensure that our pre tax income is sufficient to recover our deferred tax assets 
we specifically review the timing of our pre tax income in relation to the expiration of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits 
on a quarterly basis  we review the expiration dates of our net operating loss carryforwards that we believe to be at near term risk 
in addition  we complete a study on the impact of section of the internal revenue code on at least a semi annual basis to determine whether a change in ownership may limit the value of our net operating loss carryforwards 
however  as noted in item a risk factors  there are risks to our future financial performance and the financial impact of the risks may be difficult to anticipate 
consequently  there is a possibility that we may not meet the minimum level of us pre tax income to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards such that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will become impaired 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of possible impairment  we applied a hypothetical decrease to future pre tax income 
this hypothetical decrease would not result in the impairment of our deferred tax assets 
beginning in fiscal  we determined that a valuation allowance against our then existing deferred tax asset position was necessary 
we based this decision on the fact that in the fourth quarter of  we generated sufficient operating losses on a tax basis to fully recover all taxes paid in prior years 
in addition  our expectations of limited profitability  if any  due to the softness in the telecommunication industry during fiscal  combined with the significant tax losses generated by the sale of our echo cancellation software technology led us to conclude that the recovery of our deferred tax assets was no longer more likely than not 
in the second quarter of  based on the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods that our deferred tax assets are deductible  we determined that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would be realized 
we therefore released the valuation allowance of million in fiscal our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to stock based compensation  research and experimentation tax credits  state taxes  tax impact of foreign operations  and changes in the state tax rate as it relates to certain deferred tax assets specifically for california purposes only 
the state tax rate changed with respect to this deferred tax asset as a result of our filing tax returns in additional other states 
the effective tax rate was   and for fiscal   and  respectively 
we are not currently under audit by any tax jurisdiction 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
recent accounting pronouncements 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with statement and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
additionally  interpretation provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we will adopt interpretation in the first quarter of fiscal and are currently evaluating whether adoption will have a material effect on our overall results of operations or financial position 
in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework and guidance regarding the methods for measuring fair value  and expands related disclosures about those measurements 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently assessing the impact that sfas will have on our results of operations and financial position 
in february  the fasb issued statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment to fas sfas 
sfas allows entities to choose  at specified election dates  to measure eligible financial assets and liabilities at fair value in situations in which they are not otherwise required to be measured at fair value 
if a company elects the fair value option for an eligible item  changes in that item s fair value in subsequent reporting periods must be recognized in current earnings 
sfas also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to draw comparison between entities that elect different measurement attributes for similar assets and liabilities 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently assessing the impact that sfas will have on our results of operations and financial position 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated results of operations years ended april  revenue cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative amortization of purchased intangible assets in process research and development total operating expenses income loss from continuing operations other income  net income loss from continuing operations before provision for income taxes provision benefit for income taxes income loss from continuing operations discontinued operations gain loss on disposition income tax expense benefit from gain loss on disposition income loss from discontinued operations net income loss discussion of fiscal years ended april    and revenue years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands revenue change the increase in revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was driven  in part  by increased shipments to our domestic wireless customers  primarily verizon  as they continued to expand and update their networks 
however  the largest impact on our year over year revenue growth was the growth in our international revenues 
international revenues grew by approximately million  largely driven by new customers in the middle east and latin america regions 
the decrease in revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a lack of orders from nextel  our second largest fiscal customer  and to a level of shipments to our largest fiscal customer  verizon  more consistent with historical shipments to them 
in december  nextel announced a plan to merge with sprint 
as a result of any merger  product purchases for network deployment may be reviewed  postponed or canceled based on revised plans for technology or network expansion for the merged entity 
we believe this is what has happened at nextel and  consequently  our fiscal revenue from nextel was nominal compared to of our total worldwide revenue  or million  in fiscal in fiscal  our largest customer  verizon  a domestic wireless carrier  accounted for of our total worldwide revenue  as compared to in fiscal and in our second largest customer in fiscal and was orascom telecom  an international carrier that accounted for and of worldwide revenue  respectively 
nextel  our second largest customer in  accounted for of worldwide revenue 
in fiscal and  sales of our broadband voice processor flex bvp flex accounted for and of our revenue  respectively 
because the bvp flex provides increased flexibility and easier installation  it has been critical in helping us to acquire and retain our key domestic strategic customers  most prominently verizon 
in fiscal  we introduced our vqa product  which includes our new voice quality features and is primarily targeted at the international gsm market 
although we expected the sales of vqa products to be higher in the fiscal and based on the number of customer trials in which we were engaged  we did not realize significant growth in revenue from this product until very late in fiscal and throughout fiscal during fiscal  sales of our vqa product accounted for approximately of our worldwide revenue 
while the revenue has been slow to materialize  we continue to believe that vqa presents material revenue opportunities  and we will therefore continue to invest in our international infrastructure and in customer trials 
following the success of our bvp flex  revenue over the three fiscal years has been generated largely from domestic sales  which represented   and of our fiscal  and revenue  respectively 
as noted in the preceding paragraph  our international growth has primarily been dependent on our success in selling vqa 
although fiscal represents our most successful year of selling to international markets  we expect that in the coming year the international portion of our business will continue to grow as a percentage of overall sales as we realize more sales of our vqa applications 
however  we expect that our domestic customers will continue to represent the majority of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
revenue levels for fiscal will be dependent on our success in adding new customers domestically and internationally  the network technology and deployment plans of the north american telecommunication service providers and the market acceptance of our packet voice processor 
see item a risk factors for discussions of risks related to customer concentration and other factors  which could impact the timing and level of revenue 
see our cautionary language in the first paragraph of item business regarding forward looking statements such as the statements made in the prior paragraphs about our expectations regarding our future revenue  as well as statements regarding our expectations in each of the categories below 
cost of goods sold years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands cost of goods sold change cost of goods sold consists of direct material costs  personnel costs for test and quality assurance  costs of licensed technology incorporated into our products  post sales installation costs  provisions for inventory and warranty expenses and other indirect costs 
the increase in cost of goods sold in fiscal as compared to fiscal was largely due to the increase in business volume 
however  cost of goods sold did not increase in direct proportion with the increase in revenue due to the inclusion of million of costs associated with stock compensation charges pursuant to sfas r in fiscal  and the customer product mix which was more heavily weighted to lower margin international customers and products  as well as the other factors discussed in the discussion of gross margin below 
the decrease in cost of goods sold in fiscal was primarily driven by the decrease in business volume as compared to fiscal however  cost of goods sold did not decrease in direct proportion to the decrease in sales due to the higher standard cost of the flex sales in fiscal relative to the standard cost of bvp flex sales in fiscal and higher service costs due to installations at our largest customer and one of our new international customers 
the flex combines echo cancellation technology with elements of our vqa suite of voice enhancement software to provide quality enhancement 
our inventory provisions recorded were million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
our analysis of gross profit below discusses the other factors driving changes in cost of goods sold 
gross margin years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands gross profit gross margin pts pts as discussed above  the primary reasons for the percentage point decline in gross margin in fiscal from fiscal were the inclusion of approximately million of stock compensation  due to adoption of sfas r in fiscal  and the customer product mix  which was heavily impacted by an increased percentage of our revenues being derived from lower margin international markets 
partially offsetting the negative impacts of the international revenue mix was an increase  albeit still a relatively minor percentage of our overall revenue  in higher margin maintenance revenue 
also impacting gross margin unfavorably was an increase in the level of installation service spending to support both our international and domestic customer growth 
partially offsetting these net negative factors on gross margin was the cessation of amortization of the technology asset established upon the sale of our core echo cancellation technology in fiscal this resulted in a gross profit improvement of approximately million in fiscal fiscal gross margin also benefited from the sale of approximately million of previously written down inventory and the reversal of approximately million of warranty reserves due to the favorable resolution of a potential recall of a defective component in one of our older products with a past customer 
the primary reasons for the percentage point decrease in gross margin in fiscal from fiscal were the unfavorable customer and product mix  which included the impact of the higher standard cost of the flex sales relative to the standard cost of bvp flex and lower margin fiscal international sales  and higher service costs due to installations at our largest customer and one of our new international customers 
those unfavorable changes were partially offset by a combination of higher overhead utilization and lower manufacturing costs  lower standard product costs relative to fiscal and improved warranty and inventory obsolescence experience 
in fiscal  we sold million of previously written down inventory at approximately net book value 
we expect gross margins in the fiscal to be approximate those experienced in fiscal based on forecasted product and customer mix and the impact of continued compensation charges due to recording stock compensation expense pursuant to sfas r 
over the next several quarters  if we are successful in international deployment  we expect to experience continued pricing pressures as we expand the distribution of our products through value added resellers and distributors 
sales and marketing increase decrease years ended april  from prior year s in thousands sales and marketing expense of revenue pts pts sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel costs  including commissions and costs associated with customer service  travel  trade shows and outside consulting services 
salary and related expenses increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to incremental hiring of domestic personnel and marketing personnel to support introduction of our voip product offerings  and pre and post sales engineers to support a greater level of installation activity and our voip products 
fiscal salary and related costs included stock based compensation associated with adoption of sfas r  which contributed an additional million of the increase in spending in fiscal the other key increases were attributable to a million increase in agent fees associated with international sales growth  a million increase in travel costs related to increased customer contacts related to international expansion and expansion of our pvp trials  and a million increase in amortization of field demonstration and evaluation systems associated with the protracted nature of customer evaluations of our vqa and voip products 
salary and related expenses increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to employees acquired from jasomi  incremental hiring of international salespersons  hiring pre and post sales engineers to support a greater level of installation activity and the introduction of the packet voice processor  and the hiring of a new sales vice president 
salary and related costs included the incremental salaries and stock based and convertible debenture amortization associated with the jasomi acquisition discussed in more detail in acquisition related compensation expense below 
we incurred incremental costs of approximately million for participation in trade shows primarily showcasing our packet voice processor applications 
travel and related costs increased million over the prior year due to support required for international product evaluations of our vqa applications 
third party installation expense increased million compared to fiscal to support the great level of installation activity 
those increases were partially offset by an increase in absorption of service expenses to cost of sales of million due to installation support requirements at our largest customer 
we expect that our sales and marketing expenses in fiscal will be relatively consistent with the level experienced in fiscal due to anticipated stability in the level of staffing across the sales  marketing and service organizations and a more targeted marketing program  the savings from which should substantially offset increased variable compensation and agent fees tied to anticipated increases in sales levels 
research and development years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands research and development expense of revenue pts pts research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel costs  contract consultants  materials and supplies used in the development of voice processing products 
the increase in spending in fiscal was largely driven by salary and related costs which increased million due to increases in headcount in the engineering area and merit increases and million associated with stock compensation charges attributable to the adoption of sfas r in fiscal in addition to these increases  we experienced increases in outside service costs to supplement headcount demands and increased deprecation expense associated with increase lab equipment to support new product design and test and increased headcount levels totaling million 
the latter increases were substantially offset by a reduction in spending on consumable materials due to the later stage of development of our products in fiscal as compared to fiscal salary and related costs increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in spending was primarily associated with engineers hired as part of our acquisition of jasomi and our research and development efforts for our new packet based voice products 
salary and related costs included the incremental salaries and stock based and convertible debenture amortization associated with the jasomi acquisition discussed in more detail in acquisition related compensation expense below 
depreciation  information technology related costs and maintenance on software and equipment used by the engineering departments accounted for an aggregate increase of million in fiscal due  in large part  to the increased demands from the larger engineering workforce needed to support our existing voice products  as well as our move into packet based voice products which required purchases of lab equipment 
travel related expense increased million for the year due to increased support of field trials and travel between our canada location and our california headquarters 
those increases were partially offset by decreases of million in outside service expense 
that expense declined based on our stage in packet voice processor development and our hiring of additional regular employees to complete the work 
additionally  facilities expense allocated to research and development declined million due to the renegotiation of our headquarters lease 
we expect modest increases in our research and development spending in fiscal as we develop variations of our pvp product for use in emerging wireless networks  which will result in increases in headcount  outside services and consumed materials 
general and administrative years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands general and administrative expense of revenue pts pts general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel costs for corporate officers  finance and human resources personnel  as well as insurance  legal  accounting and consulting costs 
the increase in fiscal spending is largely due to the adoption of sfas r  which resulted in million of stock compensation 
the increase was also impacted by other salary related costs  which increased due to increased headcount and annual merit increases totaling approximately million and a million increase in professional fees attributable to the various legal matters that we are currently addressing 
the decrease in fiscal spending over fiscal spending is largely due to fiscal outside services for consulting and audit costs related to sarbanes oxley compliance and taxes declining million compared to fiscal  primarily because the workload was significantly less in the second year of sarbanes oxley compliance 
those reductions were offset by the cost of legal work related to the class action lawsuits  which resulted in an increase of million compared to fiscal we expect a slight increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal due to planned increases in base pay and variable compensation and professional fees 
acquisition related compensation expense in fiscal  we recorded compensation expense related to the vesting of assumed stock options and the restricted stock grants made in connection with the june  acquisition of jasomi 
deferred stock based compensation represents the intrinsic value of the unvested portion of options assumed and restricted shares granted to jasomi employees and is amortized to research and development expense and sales and marketing expense over the corresponding vesting periods 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation charges included in operating expenses were as follows year ended april  sales and marketing research and development total in fiscal  we adopted sfas r  which replaced the above compensation charges associated with our acquisition of jasomi and also introduced compensation charges for all equity based employee programs 
compensation charges related to the jasomi acquisition are now embedded in the stock compensation charges reported in the sales and marketing and research and development lines  discussed below 
in fiscal and  we recorded compensation expense related to the portion of convertible debentures issued to employee stockholders 
we are amortizing the compensation expense to research and development expense and sales and marketing expense over the lives of the convertible debentures 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
convertible debenture amortization included in operating expenses was as follows years ended april sales and marketing research and development total amortization of purchased intangible assets for the years ended april  and  we recorded amortization of purchased intangible assets related to the jasomi acquisition 
we are amortizing purchased intangible assets to operating expense over their estimated useful life which ranges from four to five years 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
years ended april amortization of purchased intangible assets of revenue in process research and development year ended april  in process research and development of revenue in fiscal  we incurred a charge for in process research and development in process r d acquired as part of our acquisition of jasomi 
the amount of the purchase price for jasomi allocated to in process r d was determined through established valuation techniques common in the high technology communications equipment industry 
in process r d is expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility has not been established and no future alternative uses exist 
in valuing in process r d  cash flows were based on estimates from our and jasomi s management and from various public  financial and industry sources 
we projected net revenue to grow through calendar and decline thereafter based on the rate of technology changes in the industry  product life cycles and various projects stages of development 
we estimated cost of goods sold and operating expenses  including research and development expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenue based on historical averages and forward looking projections 
we also included in the projections estimated costs to bring projects to technological feasibility and costs associated with activities undertaken to correct errors or keep products updated also referred to as maintenance research and development 
we based the tax expense on statutory federal and california tax rates 
we based the percentage of completion of in process projects on an averaging of expenses incurred to date compared to the total estimated development costs for each project  time incurred to date and remaining time to complete each project and milestone based percent complete estimates 
the in process projects pertained to general enhancements to peerpoint software  combining of nat and peering capability  increasing throughput capability  enhancing the interface and developing a denial of service module 
the average percentage complete for the in process projects was as of the date of the acquisition 
at the time of the acquisition  we estimated that these development efforts would be completed in nine months at an estimated cost of approximately million 
as of april   the remaining estimated cost to complete the project is approximately million  primarily due to other projects taking higher priority in fiscal resulting in most of the development related to the last element of the in process projects slipping into fiscal the cost of capital used to discount estimated cash flows reflects the estimated time to complete the projects and the level of risk involved 
other income  net years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands other income  net of revenue pts pts other income  net consists of interest income on our invested cash and cash equivalent and investment balances  offset by a nominal amount of foreign exchange losses 
the increase in other income  net in fiscal compared to was primarily attributable to higher interest income  due to a significant improvement in the return on our invested cash and larger average invested balances in fiscal the increase in fiscal compared to was also primarily attributable to higher interest income  due to our larger invested cash balance and an improvement in the return on our invested cash as interest rates began to increase 
our fiscal interest income will be dependent on our cash balances and the movement of us interest rates 
income taxes  continuing operations years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands income taxes  continuing operations of revenue pts pts income taxes consist of federal  state and foreign income taxes 
the tax provision for fiscal resulted in an effective tax rate of 
the effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to stock based compensation expense  research and experimentation tax credits  state taxes  tax impact of foreign operations and changes in the state tax rate as it relates to certain deferred tax assets specifically for california purposes only 
the tax provision benefit for fiscal resulted in an effective tax rate of 
the effective tax rate for the year was adversely affected by non deductible jasomi acquisition related charges  including our inability to deduct for tax purposes in process r d related to the acquisition of jasomi and convertible debenture amortization  and the correction of a million error in the balance of a deferred tax asset related to a california r d tax credit 
the error originated in the second quarter of fiscal at the time we released our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and was corrected in the fourth quarter of fiscal after conducting a thorough analytical review on materiality  which was brought to the attention of and discussed with the audit committee  management believes that these amounts are not material to previously reported financial statements 
those items were partially offset by the reversal of million of reserves on deferred tax assets primarily associated with a california r d tax credit position under audit by california s franchise tax board 
in april  we reached an agreement with the franchise tax board regarding our tax credit positions and consequently revised associated reserves 
the benefit in fiscal includes the reversal of our valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets 
in fiscal  we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would realize the benefit related to our deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we reduced the valuation allowance against the assets and recorded a tax benefit to continuing operations of million 
the recognition of the deferred tax assets had no impact on our fiscal cash flows 
partially offsetting the tax benefit recorded was income tax expense associated with income earned by our foreign subsidiaries and state and federal alternative minimum tax totaling million in fiscal we expect the effective tax rate to be at a more normalized rate of approximately in fiscal income loss from discontinued operations years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands gain loss on disposition income tax expense benefit from gain loss on disposition income loss from discontinued operations of revenue pts pts in june  we came to a mutual settlement and release with jdsu whereby jdsu paid us million 
we had recorded receivables of million such that the net financial gain from the settlement was million 
as part of the settlement  jdsu additionally released us from our warranty obligation  which resulted in the release of million of our warranty liability 
in addition  in june  we completed the closure of our international optical operations and  as a result  reversed our remaining million of reserves related to the closure 
net of million of tax expense  the transactions resulted in a million gain from disposal of our discontinued operations 
in fiscal  we completed the wind up of our optical operations  resulting in no financial impact from discontinued operations in fiscal see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the million gain on disposition in fiscal was due to adjustments needed to reflect actual costs incurred 
the loss on disposition in fiscal reflects the aggregate loss of million realized in the first quarter of fiscal upon the sale of the optical technology  inventory and certain fixed assets to jdsu  along with other exit costs associated with abandoning that portion of the optical business not acquired by jdsu 
subsequent adjustments to the loss resulted in an incremental loss of approximately million and were included in the total loss from disposal of our discontinued optical operations of million for fiscal in the consolidated statement of operations 
as all operations related to our optical business ceased in fiscal  we did not have further losses from this discontinued operation in fiscal  or liquidity and capital resources as of april   we had cash and cash equivalents of million as compared to million at april  and million as of april  additionally  we had million of short term investments as of april  compared to million of short term investments as of april  and million as of april  we have satisfied the majority of our liquidity requirements through cash flow generated from operations  funds received upon exercise of stock options and the proceeds from our initial and follow on public offerings in fiscal cash flows from operating activities years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands cash flow from operating activities our cash flow from operations generally follows our profitability trend of million  million  and million inclusive of a non cash tax benefit from the release of a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets for fiscal  and  respectively 
the difference in cash flow from operations in fiscal and profitability is largely due to the growth in inventory in the fourth quarter of fiscal due to lower than anticipated revenue levels in the quarter 
the improved cash flow from operations in fiscal as compared to profitability was due to a combination of reducing accounts receivable due to improved collections and more linear sales patterns in fiscal and increasing deferred revenue due to several shipments near the end of the year which required deferral treatment  which resulted in million of operating cash flow 
we expect to see positive cash flows from operations in the coming year based on projected revenue growth 
we expect  however  increases in accounts receivable as we sell more product internationally  as international customers typically have longer payment terms  and increases in operating expenses partially offset by a reduction of inventory that grew in the fourth quarter of fiscal cash flows from investing activities years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands cash flow from investing activities the change in cash flows from investing activities is due to three key events 
first  in fiscal  we changed our investing strategy to include short term and long term investments designed to improve our overall return on invested funds  which accounted for the majority of the cash used in  but had little impact in fiscal and as we had limited proceeds from operating and financing activities to invest in short term securities 
second  we used million of cash in fiscal and million of cash in fiscal related to the acquisition of jasomi see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  we collected proceeds from the sale of our optical business and other minor sales of optical equipment of only million and in fiscal and we had no proceeds from the optical business 
we plan to continue to invest in capital assets related to new product features and to support our efforts to sell our voip products 
in the first quarter of fiscal  million of the convertible debentures mature and were paid in cash upon surrender of the notes 
cash flows from financing activities years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands cash flow from financing activities the limited cash flow from financing activities in fiscal and was due to the limited level of option activity during those years largely due to a large portion of the options being out of the money or only marginally in the money due to the decline in our stock price 
the cash flow used in financing activities in fiscal was largely due to the repurchase of shares of common stock  as discussed below  partially offset by funds received from stock option exercises 
we repurchased no common stock in fiscal or stock option activity in the first half of fiscal was particularly high following the trend in our stock price over that same period 
stock repurchase programs in december  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of common stock under a stock repurchase program 
during fiscal  we repurchased and retired  shares of our common stock at an average price of per share for an aggregate purchase price of million 
consequently  we are not authorized to repurchase additional shares under the stock repurchase program approved in december of the aggregate purchase price of the shares of our common stock repurchased was reflected as a reduction to shareholders equity 
in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 status of accounting research bulletins  we allocated the purchase price of the repurchased shares as a reduction to retained earnings  common stock and additional paid in capital 
on june   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of common stock under a stock repurchase program 
we do not expect to begin repurchasing any stock until at least the second quarter of fiscal commitments we have no material commitments other than obligations under operating leases  particularly our facility leases  and normal purchases of inventory  capital equipment and operating expenses  such as materials for research and development and consulting 
we currently occupy approximately  square feet of space in the two buildings that form our mountain view  california headquarters 
in september  we renegotiated our mountain view  california lease  which extended the lease term through july  and reduced the rent cost 
we additionally have leased office space in calgary  canada  primarily for r d operations  under an operating lease expiring january  our contractual commitments  by year in which they become due  are as follows payments due by period contractual obligations in thousands total less than year to years to years over years operating leases purchase commitments convertible notes total jasomi acquisition consideration included million in non transferable convertible notes  divided into two tranches with principal amounts of million and million  respectively 
the million of notes plus interest accrued at was paid in the first quarter of fiscal the million of notes mature on june   as no holder elected to extend or convert the notes 
we have not made any indemnification claims  nor have a sufficient number of designated employees left our employment  to cause a reduction in the principal amounts of the notes  and so the full million of the second tranche of notes  plus interest accrued at  were paid in cash during the first quarter of fiscal upon surrender of the notes 
we believe that we will be able to satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next two years from our existing cash and short term investments 
we currently expect to renew our million line of credit  which expires in july the ability to fund our operations beyond the next two fiscal years will be dependent on the overall demand of telecommunications providers for new capital equipment 
should our customers significantly reduce their purchases of our products compared to current levels of purchases  we could need to find additional sources of cash during fiscal or be forced to reduce our spending levels to protect our cash reserves 
off balance sheet arrangements as of april   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk due to changes in the general level of united states interest rates relates primarily to our cash equivalents and short term investment portfolios 
our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments are primarily maintained at four major financial institutions in the united states 
as of april  and  we did not hold any derivative instruments 
the primary objective of our investment activities is the preservation of principal while maximizing investment income and minimizing risk  and we attempt to achieve this by diversifying our portfolio in a variety of highly rated investment securities that have limited terms to maturity 
we do not hold any instruments for trading purposes 
investment securities that have maturities of more than three months at the date of purchase but current maturities of less than one year and auction rate securities  which management is able to liquidate on or day auction cycles  are considered short term investments 
short term investments consist primarily of corporate bonds and asset backed securities 
short term investments are maintained at three major financial institutions  are classified as available for sale  and are recorded on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
if we sell our short term investments prior to their maturity  we may incur a charge to operations in the period the sale took place 
in fiscal  and  we realized no gains or losses on our short term investments
