item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation you should read the following discussion in conjunction with part i  including the matters set forth in the risk factors section of this form k  and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading operator in the trillion automotive retail industry 
as of december   we owned and operated franchises at dealership locations and collision centers 
we market and sell an extensive range of automotive products and services including new and used vehicles and related financing  vehicle maintenance and repair services  replacement parts  and warranty  insurance and extended service contracts 
our operations are primarily located in major metropolitan areas in alabama  california  florida  georgia  louisiana  massachusetts  mississippi  new hampshire  new jersey  new mexico  new york  oklahoma  and texas 
prior to january   our retail network was organized into regional dealership groups  or platforms 
in  the company reorganized its operations and as of december   the retail network consisted of the following four regions with the number of dealerships they comprised i the northeast dealerships in massachusetts  new hampshire  new jersey and new york  ii the southeast dealerships in alabama  florida  georgia  louisiana and mississippi  iii the central dealerships in new mexico  oklahoma and texas  and iv the west dealerships in california 
each region is managed by a regional vice president reporting directly to the company s chief executive officer  as well as a regional chief financial officer reporting directly to the company s chief financial officer 
during  as throughout our nine year history  we grew our business primarily through acquisitions 
we typically seek to acquire large  profitable  well established and well managed dealerships that are leaders in their respective market areas 
over the past five years  we have acquired dealership franchises with annual revenues of approximately billion  disposed of or terminated dealership franchises with annual revenues of approximately million  and been granted ten new dealership franchises by the manufacturers 
each acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and the corresponding results of operations of these dealerships are included in our financial statements from the date of acquisition 
in the following discussion and analysis  we report certain performance measures of our newly acquired dealerships separately from those of our existing dealerships 
our operating results reflect the combined performance of each of our interrelated business activities  which include the sale of new vehicles  used vehicles  finance and insurance products  and parts  service and collision repair services 
historically  each of these activities has been directly or indirectly impacted by a variety of supply demand factors  including vehicle inventories  consumer confidence  discretionary spending  availability and affordability of consumer credit  manufacturer incentives  weather patterns  fuel prices and interest rates 
for 
table of contents example  during periods of sustained economic downturn or significant supply demand imbalances  new vehicle sales may be negatively impacted as consumers tend to shift their purchases to used vehicles 
some consumers may even delay their purchasing decisions altogether  electing instead to repair their existing vehicles 
in such cases  however  we believe the impact on our overall business is mitigated by our ability to offer other products and services  such as used vehicles and parts  service and collision repair services 
we generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales and service in the second and third calendar quarters of each year 
this seasonality is generally attributable to consumer buying trends and the timing of manufacturer new vehicle model introductions 
in addition  in some regions of the united states  vehicle purchases decline during the winter months 
as a result  our revenues  cash flows and operating income are typically lower in the first and fourth quarters and higher in the second and third quarters 
other factors unrelated to seasonality  such as changes in economic condition and manufacturer incentive programs  may exaggerate seasonal or cause counter seasonal fluctuations in our revenues and operating income 
for the years ended december   and  we realized net income of million  million and million  respectively  and diluted earnings per share of  and  respectively 
the following factors impacted our financial condition and results of operations in  and  and may cause our reported financial data not to be indicative of our future financial condition and operating results 
year ended december  asset impairments in conjunction with our annual impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  we determined the carrying value of indefinite lived intangible franchise rights associated with two of our domestic franchises to be impaired 
accordingly  we recognized a million pretax impairment charge in the fourth quarter of in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we entered into an agreement to sell one of our ford dealership franchises and  as a result  identified the carrying value of certain fixed assets associated with the dealership to be impaired 
in connection therewith  we recorded a pretax impairment charge of million 
hurricanes katrina and rita insurance settlements and new orleans recovery we settled all building  content and vehicle damage and business interruption insurance claims with our insurance carriers in as a result  we recognized an additional million of business interruption proceeds related to covered payroll and fixed cost expenditures incurred during  as a reduction of selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
lease terminations on march   we announced that the dealer services group of automatic data processing inc adp would become the sole dealership management system provider for our existing stores 
we converted a number of our stores from other systems to adp in and settled the lease termination agreement with one of our other system providers for all stores converted as of december  in june  as a result of the significant damage sustained at our dodge store on the east bank of new orleans during hurricane katrina  we terminated our franchise with daimlerchrylser  dealership operations at this store and the associated facilities lease agreement 
as a result of the lease termination  we recognized a million charge 
dealership disposals we disposed of franchises during  resulting in an aggregate gain on sale of million 
severance costs in conjunction with our management realignment from platform to regional structures  we entered into severance agreements with several employees 
in aggregate  these severance costs amounted to million in stock based compensation we provide compensation benefits to employees and non employee directors pursuant to our stock option plan  as amended  and employee stock purchase plan  as amended 
historically  we utilized stock options to provide long term incentive to these individuals 
however  beginning in march  we began utilizing restricted stock awards or  at the recipient s election  phantom 
table of contents stock awards  in lieu of stock options 
any future grants of either stock options or restricted stock awards are subject to the discretion of our board of directors 
as a result of adopting fasb statement no 
r  share based payment  on january   we recognized million of additional stock based compensation expense related to stock options and million related to the purchase plan during the year ended december  our income before income taxes and net income for the year ended december   were therefore million and million lower than if we had continued to account for stock based compensation under apb basic and diluted earnings per share were both lower for the year ended december   than if we had continued to account for the stock based compensation under apb year ended december  hurricanes katrina and rita on august   hurricane katrina struck the gulf coast of the united states  including new orleans  louisiana 
at that time  we operated six dealerships in the new orleans area consisting of nine franchises 
two of the dealerships were located in the heavily flooded east bank of new orleans and nearby metairie areas  while the other four are located on the west bank of new orleans  where flood related damage was less severe 
the east bank stores suffered significant damage and were ultimately closed in and the respective franchises terminated 
the west bank stores reopened approximately two weeks after the storm 
on september   hurricane rita came ashore along the texas louisiana border  near houston and beaumont  texas 
the company operates two dealerships in beaumont  texas  consisting of eleven franchises and nine dealerships in the houston area consisting of seven franchises 
as a result of the evacuation by many residents of houston  and the aftermath of the storm in beaumont  all of these dealerships were closed several days before and after the storm 
all of these dealerships have since resumed normal operations 
at the time of the incidents  we estimated the damage sustained at our new orleans area and beaumont dealership facilities and our inventory of new and used vehicles at those locations to be approximately million 
after we applied the terms of our underlying property and casualty insurance policies  we recorded an insurance recovery receivable totaling million and reduced the above noted estimated loss to million 
this loss is included in selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
the receivable was established based on our determination  given our experience with these type claims and discussions to date with our insurance carriers  that it is probable that recovery will occur for the amount of these losses and the cost to repair our leased facilities in excess of insurance policy deductibles 
we made the determination of whether recovery was probable in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  which defines probable as being likely to occur 
during the fourth quarter  we received total payments on these receivables of million 
we maintain business interruption insurance coverage under which our insurance providers advanced a total of million  subject to final audit under the policies and also subject to settlement adjustments 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded approximately million of these proceeds  related to covered payroll and fixed cost expenditures since august   as a reduction to the above noted loss accrual 
final audits and settlement adjustments were made during  resulting in an additional million in insurance proceeds received 
we recorded the remaining million of business interruption insurance proceeds in as a reduction of selling  general and administrative expenses 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for some of our dealerships  our adoption of eitf d  use of the residual method to value acquired assets other than goodwill  resulted in intangible franchise rights having carrying values that were in excess of their fair values 
this required us to write off the excess value of million  net of deferred taxes of million  or per diluted share  as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of asset impairments in connection with the preparation and review of our third quarter interim financial statements  we determined that recent events and circumstances in new orleans indicated that an 
table of contents impairment of goodwill  intangible franchise rights and or other long lived assets may have occurred in the three months ended september  therefore  we performed interim impairment assessments of these assets 
as a result of these assessments  we determined that the carrying value of the intangible franchise right associated with our dodge franchise in new orleans was impaired and recorded a pretax charge of million during the third quarter of due to the then pending disposals of two of our california franchises  a kia and a nissan franchise  we tested the respective asset groups for impairment during the third quarter of these tests resulted in impairments of long lived assets totaling million 
during our annual review of the fair value of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at december   we determined that the fair value of indefinite lived intangible franchise rights related to three of our franchises  primarily a pontiac gmc franchise in the south central region  did not exceed their carrying value and impairment charges were required 
accordingly  we recorded a million pretax impairment charge during the fourth quarter of year ended december  impairment of goodwill and long lived assets as a result of the further deterioration of our atlanta platform s financial results  we concluded that the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value as of september  accordingly  in the third quarter of  we recorded a total pretax charge of million related to the impairment of the carrying value of its goodwill and certain long lived assets 
loss on redemption of senior subordinated notes in march  we completed the redemption of all of our outstanding senior subordinated notes and incurred a million pretax charge 
impairment of indefinite lived intangible asset during our annual assessment of the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in connection with our year end financial statement preparation process  we determined that the carrying value of one of our mitsubishi franchises in the california region was in excess of its fair market value 
accordingly  we recorded a pretax charge of million 
these items  and other variances between the periods presented  are covered in the following discussion 

table of contents key performance indicators the following table highlights certain of the key performance indicators we use to manage our business consolidated statistical data for the year ended december  unit sales retail sales new vehicle used vehicle total retail sales wholesale sales total vehicle sales gross margin new vehicle retail sales adjusted used vehicle total parts and service sales total gross margin sg a as a of gross profit operating margin pretax margin finance and insurance revenues per retail unit sold we monitor a statistic we call adjusted used vehicle gross margin which equals total used vehicle gross profit  which includes the total net profit or loss from the wholesale sale of used vehicles  divided by retail used vehicle sales revenues 
the net profit or loss on wholesale used vehicle sales are included in this number  as these transactions facilitate retail used vehicle sales and management of inventory levels 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
the following discussion briefly highlights certain of the results and trends occurring within our business 
throughout the following discussion  references are made to same store results and variances  which are discussed in more detail in the results of operations section that follows 
since  our retail unit sales have increased as the impact of our acquisitions were offset by slight declines in same store unit sales 
while our new vehicle retail sales have increased each year  our used vehicle retail sales increased from to  but declined slightly from to we experienced a decline in same store new vehicle retail sales from to and from to as production in our domestic brands weakened  consistent with their overall national performance 
the domestic downturn was offset by improvements in our year over year same store import and luxury brands results and  on a consolidated basis  was further compensated each year by substantial increases in new vehicle retail sales as a result of acquisitions 
the decline in our same store used vehicle retail sales from to was offset by a substantial escalation in used vehicle retail sales from acquisitions 
conversely  from to  the decline in same store used vehicle retail sales was only partially counterbalanced by the results from our transactions 
our same store used vehicle retail sales have declined from to  as we have taken intentional steps toward better managing our used vehicle inventory and becoming more critical of the used vehicles we purchase and retain for resale  resulting in better overall performance of our used vehicle business 
despite the decline in same store new vehicle retail sales over the past three years  we have maintained our new vehicle gross margin at for the twelve months ended december  and  with a slight increase to in at the same time  we have improved our same store gross profit per new retail unit sold to  per 
table of contents unit in as compared to  per unit in  and to  per unit in as compared to  per unit in in addition  our consolidated gross profit per new retail unit sold has risen from  per unit in  to  per unit in and  per unit in our same store gross profit per retail unit sold was up slightly in  as we experienced a strong contribution from the full year impact of franchises  primarily luxury and import  acquired in in  we benefited from higher gross profits per retail units sold  primarily attributable to our domestic and import brands 
our used vehicle results are directly affected by the level of manufacturer incentives on new vehicles  the number and quality of trade ins and lease turn ins and the availability of consumer credit 
over the last three years  we have seen a decline in same store retail sales of used vehicle units  partially offset by the benefit received from acquisitions 
during this same time period  however  we have seen pricing begin to stabilize  we have initiated efforts to better manage our used vehicle inventory and taken deliberate action to maximize our retail used vehicle profits 
as a result  our same store retail and consolidated wholesale volumes have declined from to  but adjusted used vehicle total margin has increased from in  to in and in our consolidated parts and service gross margin decreased slightly from in  to in  and remained relatively flat from to our same store parts and service gross margin mirrored our consolidated results 
a shift from to in our business mix of lower margin wholesale parts business and higher margin customer pay and warranty related service business caused our overall parts and service gross margin to decline in as manufacturer quality issues were resolved in and our warranty related service business declined  we intensified our focus on customer pay non warranty service and maintained our gross margin between and our same store gross profit rose from to  and from to  as our overall level of sales activity increased 
overall  our consolidated gross margin has steadily improved from in to in and in our consolidated finance and insurance revenues per retail unit sold have continued to increase from per retail unit sold in to in  and in  reflecting improvements in our penetration rates and the partial dilutive effect of our acquisitions during those periods 
our same store finance and insurance revenues per unit sold paralleled our consolidated results  increasing from per retail unit sold in as compared to in  and from in as compared to in during the past three years  our consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses sg a as a percentage of gross profit  have continued to decline from during  to in and in the decrease in sg a as a percentage of gross profit from to was the combined result of the increases in gross profit noted above and personnel related cost reduction initiatives implemented in late and early these reductions were partially offset by the adoption of sfas r  share based payment  resulting in compensation expense being recognized related to stock option and employee stock purchase grants 
the decline in sg a as a percentage of gross profit from to came primarily from reductions in advertising costs 
our same store results in sg a as a percentage of gross profit emulated the consolidated results  as the ratio of declined to when compared to  and from to when comparing to the combination of the above factors  together with the reduction in the level of impairment charges recorded in and  as compared to  partially offset by an increase in our floorplan interest expense over the three year period  contributed to a net improvement in our operating margin to in and in  as compared to in  and in our pretax margin to in and in  as compared to in our floorplan interest expense increased primarily as a result of rising interest rates 
we believe that our continued growth depends on  among other things  our ability to successfully acquire and integrate new dealerships  while at the same time achieving optimum performance from our diverse franchise mix  attracting and retaining high caliber employees and reinvesting as needed to maintain top quality facilities 
during  we expect to spend approximately million to construct new facilities and upgrade or expand existing facilities  although we expect to finance some of this construction with a new mortgage facility as well as with funds from sell and lease back transactions 
in addition  we expect to complete acquisitions of dealerships with at least million in expected aggregate annual revenues 

table of contents critical accounting policies and accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies we use and the estimates and assumptions we make during their preparation 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies and critical accounting estimates 
critical accounting policies we have identified below what we believe to be the most pervasive accounting policies that are of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of all our significant accounting policies 
inventories 
we carry our new  used and demonstrator vehicle inventories  as well as our parts and accessories inventories  at the lower of cost or market in our consolidated balance sheets 
vehicle inventory cost consists of the amount paid to acquire the inventory  plus reconditioning cost  cost of equipment added and transportation 
additionally  we receive interest assistance from some of our manufacturers 
this assistance is accounted for as a vehicle purchase price discount and is reflected as a reduction to the inventory cost on our balance sheets and as a reduction to cost of sales in our statements of operation as the vehicles are sold 
as the market value of our inventory typically declines over time  we establish reserves based on our historical loss experience and market trends 
these reserves are charged to cost of sales and reduce the carrying value of our inventory on hand 
used vehicles are complex to value as there is no standardized source for determining exact values and each vehicle and each market in which we operate is unique 
as a result  the value of each used vehicle taken at trade in  or purchased at auction  is determined based on industry data  primarily accessed via our used vehicle management software and the industry expertise of the responsible used vehicle manager 
our valuation risk is mitigated  somewhat  by how quickly we turn this inventory 
at december   our used vehicle days supply was days 
retail finance  insurance and vehicle service contract revenues recognition 
we arrange financing for customers through various institutions and receive financing fees based on the difference between the loan rates charged to customers and predetermined financing rates set by the financing institution 
in addition  we receive fees from the sale of insurance and vehicle service contracts to customers 
further  through agreements that we have with certain vehicle service contract administrators  we earn volume incentive rebates and interest income on reserves  as well as participate in the underwriting profits of the products 
we may be charged back for unearned financing  insurance contract or vehicle service contract fees in the event of early termination of the contracts by customers 
revenues from these fees are recorded at the time of the sale of the vehicles and a reserve for future amounts which might be charged back is established based on our historical chargeback results and the termination provisions of the applicable contracts 
while our chargeback results vary depending on the type of contract sold  a change in the historical chargeback results used in determining our estimates of future amounts which might be charged back would have changed our reserve at december   by approximately million 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principals requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period 
we analyze our estimates based on our historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results could differ from such estimates 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess  at the date of acquisition  of the purchase price of businesses acquired over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
 business combinations 
prior to our adoption of sfas no 
on january   we recorded purchase prices in excess of the net tangible assets acquired as goodwill and did not separately record any intangible assets apart from goodwill as all were amortized over similar 
table of contents lives 
during  the fasb also issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which changed the treatment of goodwill to no longer permit the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  require goodwill and intangible assets  of which franchise rights are our most significant  to be recorded separately  and require  at least annually  an assessment for impairment of goodwill by reporting unit using a fair value based  two step test 
we perform the annual impairment assessment at the end of each calendar year  or more frequently if events or circumstances at a reporting unit occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
based on the organization and management of our business prior to  each of our groups of dealerships formerly referred to as platforms qualified as reporting units for the purpose of assessing goodwill for impairment 
however  with our reorganization into four regions in  and the corresponding changes in our management  operational and reporting structure we determined that goodwill should be evaluated at a regional level 
to determine the fair value of our reporting units  we use a discounted cash flow approach 
included in this analysis are assumptions regarding revenue growth rates  future gross margins  future selling  general and administrative expenses and an estimated weighted average cost of capital 
we also must estimate residual values at the end of the forecast period and future capital expenditure requirements 
each of these assumptions requires us to use our knowledge of our industry  our recent transactions and reasonable performance expectations for our operations 
if any one of the above assumptions change  in some cases insignificantly  or fails to materialize  the resulting decline in our estimated fair value could result in a material impairment charge to the goodwill associated with the reporting unit s  especially with respect to those operations acquired prior to july  intangible franchise rights 
our only significant identifiable intangible assets  other than goodwill  are rights under our franchise agreements with manufacturers 
our dealerships franchise agreements are for various terms  ranging from one year to an indefinite period 
we expect these franchise agreements to continue indefinitely and  when these agreements do not have indefinite terms  we believe that renewal of these agreements can be obtained without substantial cost 
as such  we believe that our franchise agreements will contribute to cash flows for an indefinite period 
therefore  we do not amortize the carrying amount of our franchise rights 
franchise rights acquired in acquisitions prior to july   were not separately recorded  but were recorded and amortized as part of goodwill and remain a part of goodwill at december  and  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
like goodwill  and in accordance with sfas no 
 we test our franchise rights for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate possible impairment  using a fair value method 
at the september meeting of the emerging issues task force eitf  the sec staff issued staff announcement no 
d  use of the residual method to value acquired assets other than goodwill  which states that for business combinations after september   the residual method should no longer be used to value intangible assets other than goodwill 
rather  a direct value method should be used to determine the fair value of all intangible assets other than goodwill required to be recognized under sfas no 
 business combinations 
additionally  registrants who have applied a residual method to the valuation of intangible assets for purposes of impairment testing under sfas no 
 shall perform an impairment test using a direct value method on all intangible assets that were previously valued using a residual method by no later than the beginning of their first fiscal year beginning after december  to test the carrying value of each individual franchise right for impairment under eitf d  we use a discounted cash flow based approach 
included in this analysis are assumptions  at a dealership level  regarding the cash flows directly attributable to the franchise right  revenue growth rates  future gross margins and future selling  general and administrative expenses 
using an estimated weighted average cost of capital  estimated residual values at the end of the forecast period and future capital expenditure requirements  we calculate the fair value of each dealership s franchise rights after considering estimated values for tangible assets  working capital and workforce 

table of contents for some of our dealerships  the adoption of the annual impairment provisions as of january   resulted in a fair value that was less than the carrying value of their intangible franchise rights 
as a result  a non cash charge of million  net of deferred taxes of million  was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in accordance with the transitional rules of eitf d in the first quarter of if any one of the above assumptions change  including in some cases insignificantly  or fails to materialize  the resulting decline in our intangible franchise rights estimated fair value could result in a material impairment charge to the intangible franchise right associated with the applicable dealership 
for example  if our assumptions regarding the future interest rates used in our estimated weighted average cost of capital increased by basis points  and all other assumptions remain constant  the resulting non cash charge would be approximately million 
self insured property and casualty reserves 
we are self insured for a portion of the claims related to our property and casualty insurance programs  requiring us to make estimates regarding expected losses to be incurred 
as a result of recent significant increases in the self insured portion of our worker s compensation and general liability insurance programs  we engaged a third party actuary to conduct a study of these exposures for all open policy years 
based on the results of this study  we recorded a million reduction to our estimated workers compensation and general liability accruals during the third quarter of we update this actuarial study on an annual basis and make the appropriate adjustments to our accrual 
actuarial estimates for the portion of claims not covered by insurance are based on our historical claims experience adjusted for loss trending and loss development factors 
changes in the frequency or severity of claims from historical levels could influence our reserve for claims and our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
a change in the historical loss history used in determining our estimate of future losses would have changed our reserve for these losses at december   by million 
for workers compensation and general liability insurance policy years ended prior to october   this component of our insurance program included aggregate retention stop loss limits in addition to a per claim deductible limit 
due to our historical experience in both claims frequency and severity  the likelihood of breaching the aggregate retention limits described above was deemed remote  and as such  we elected not to purchase this stop loss coverage for the policy years beginning november  and our exposure per claim under the and plans is limited to million per occurrence  with unlimited exposure on the number of claims up to million that we may incur 
our maximum potential exposure under all of our self insured property and casualty plans with aggregate retention limits originally totaled million  before consideration of amounts previously paid or accruals we have recorded related to our loss projections 
after consideration of these amounts  our remaining potential loss exposure under these plans totals approximately million at december  fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we estimate the values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations  which involves the use of various assumptions 
the most significant assumptions  and those requiring the most judgment  involve the estimated fair values of property and equipment and intangible franchise rights  with the remaining attributable to goodwill  if any 
results of operations the same store amounts presented below include the results of dealerships for the identical months in each period presented in the comparison  commencing with the first full month in which the dealership was owned by us and  in the case of dispositions  ending with the last full month it was owned by us 
same store results also include the activities of the corporate office 
for example  for a dealership acquired in june  the results from this dealership will appear in our same store comparison beginning in for the period july through december  when comparing to july through december results 
the following table summarizes our combined same store results for the twelve months ended december  as compared to and the twelve months ended december  compared to depending on the

our total new vehicle retail unit sales and revenues improved from to and from to  due primarily to the contributions of our acquisitions completed in each period 
these gains in total new vehicle retail unit sales and revenues were slightly offset by same store declines in each period  primarily attributable to continued declines in our sales of domestic nameplates 
for the year ended december   as compared to  our same store domestic nameplates declined  due to a decline in truck sales and a decline in car sales 
this decrease was substantially offset by a increase in same store import nameplates and a increase in same store luxury nameplates 
for the year ended december   as compared to  our same store domestic nameplates declined  due to decrease in truck sales offset by an increase of in car sales 
this decrease was also offset by a increase in same store import nameplates and a increase in same store luxury nameplates 
in  we anticipate that total industrywide sales of new vehicles will be slightly lower than and remain highly competitive 
however  the level of retail sales  as well as our own ability to retain or grow market share  during future periods is difficult to predict 

table of contents the following table sets forth our top ten same store brands  based on retail unit sales volume  the changes in which year to year we believe are generally consistent with the overall market in those areas we operate 
same store new vehicle unit sales for the year ended december  change change toyota scion ford nissan honda chevrolet dodge lexus bmw mercedes benz chrysler other total certain of our same store brand sales experienced year over year declines  while others exceeded prior year sales  highlighting the cyclical nature of our business and the need to have a well balanced portfolio of new vehicle brands of which we sell 
the level of retail sales  as well as our own ability to retain or grow market share  during future periods is difficult to predict 
our gross margin on new vehicle retail sales remained consistent from through on a total and same store basis 
overall  our total new vehicle gross profit improved in from and in over  while our same store gross profit remained relatively consistent between the same periods 
during  as compared to  we saw same store gross profit per retail unit improve slightly  to an average of  per unit from  mitigating the effect of lower sales volume on our gross margin 
although we experienced same store declines in our unit sales of domestic nameplates throughout  our ability to retain more gross profit from our sales of these brands including the realization and retention of higher manufacturer incentives and increased profit from sales of import brands  offset the impact of the overall unit decline 
our same store gross profit per retail unit also increased from  in to  in  reflecting an improvement in import and luxury brands 
most manufacturers offer interest assistance to offset floorplan interest charges incurred in connection with inventory purchases 
this assistance varies by manufacturer  but generally provides for a defined amount regardless of our actual floorplan interest rate or the length of time for which the inventory is financed 
the amount of interest assistance we recognize in a given period is primarily a function of the specific terms of the respective manufacturers interest assistance programs and wholesale interest rates  the average wholesale price of inventory sold  and our rate of inventory turn 
for these reasons  this assistance has ranged from approximately to of our total floorplan interest expense over the past three years 
we record these incentives as a reduction of new vehicle cost of sales as the vehicles are sold  which therefore impact the gross profit and gross margin detailed above 
the total assistance recognized in cost of goods sold during the years ended december   and  was million  million and million  respectively 
finally  our total days supply of new vehicle inventory decreased  from days supply at december  to days supply at december   but increased to days supply at december  our days supply at december   was heavily weighted toward our domestic inventory  which stood at days supply  versus our import and luxury brands in which we had a days and days supply  respectively 
we remain focused on reducing our days supply of domestic vehicles 
with respect to import and luxury brand vehicles  given the quick turn of these units which are often in high demand and low supply  we would like to increase our supply to

at times  including during each of the last three years  manufacturer incentives  such as significant rebates and below market retail financing rates on new vehicles  have resulted in a reduction of the price difference to the customer between a late model used vehicle and a new vehicle  resulting in more customers purchasing new vehicles 
in our retail used vehicle business  our total revenues increased on a slight decline in retail unit sales for as compared to likewise  our same store results reflected a improvement in used retail sales on less retail units

in general  as described more fully in the indenture  converting holders will receive  in respect of each  principal amount of notes being converted  the conversion value in cash up to  and the excess  if any  of the conversion value over  in shares of our common stock

debt issue costs totaled approximately million and are being amortized over a period of ten years the point at which the holders can first require us to redeem the notes 
the notes rank equal in right of payment to all of our other existing and future senior indebtedness 
the notes are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries and  accordingly  are structurally subordinated to all of the indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries

total cash used in completing the redemption  excluding accrued interest of million  was million 
on march   we completed the redemption of all of our senior subordinated notes 
total cash used in completing the redemption  excluding accrued interest of million  was million 
capital expenditures 
our capital expenditures include expenditures to extend the useful life of current facilities and expenditures to start or expand operations 
historically  our annual capital expenditures  exclusive of new or expanded operations  have approximately equaled our annual depreciation charge 
in general  expenditures relating to the construction or expansion of dealership facilities are driven by new franchises being granted to us by a manufacturer  significant growth in sales at an existing facility  or manufacturer imaging programs 
during  we plan to invest approximately million to expand or relocate existing facilities  including the purchase of land and related equipment  and to perform manufacturer required imaging projects 
acquisitions 
during  we completed acquisitions of franchises with expected annual revenues of approximately million 
these franchises were located in alabama  california  mississippi  new hampshire  new jersey and oklahoma 
total cash consideration paid  net of cash received  of million  included million for related real estate and the incurrence of million of inventory financing 
from january   through december   we completed acquisitions of seven franchises with expected annual revenues of approximately million 
these franchises were acquired in tuck in acquisitions that complement existing operations in massachusetts  oklahoma and texas 
the aggregate consideration paid in completing these acquisitions was approximately million in cash  net of cash received and the incurrence of million of inventory financing 
our acquisition target for is to complete acquisitions that have at least million in expected aggregate annual revenues 
we expect the cash needed to complete our acquisitions will come from excess working capital  operating cash flows of our dealerships  and borrowings under our floorplan facilities and our acquisition line 
we purchase businesses based on expected return on investment 
generally  the purchase price is approximately to of the annual revenue 
thus  our targeted acquisition budget of million is expected to cost us between and million  excluding the amount incurred to finance vehicle inventories 
since december   we have completed the acquisition of three franchises with expected annual revenues of million 
purchase of convertible note hedge 
in connection with the issuance of the notes  we purchased ten year call options on our common stock the purchased options 
under the terms of the purchased options  which become exercisable upon conversion of the notes  we have the right to purchase a total of approximately million shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share 
the total cost of the purchased options was million 
the cost of the purchased options results in future income tax deductions that we expect will total approximately million 
in addition to the purchase of the purchased options  we sold warrants in separate transactions the warrants 
these warrants have a ten year term and enable the holders to acquire shares of our common stock from us 
the warrants are exercisable for a maximum of million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  subject to adjustment for quarterly dividends in excess of per quarter  liquidation  bankruptcy  or a change in control of the company and other conditions 
subject to these adjustments  the maximum amount of shares of the company s common stock that could be required to be issued under the warrants is million shares 
the proceeds from the sale of the warrants were million 
the purchased option and warrant transactions were designed to increase the conversion price per share of our common stock from to a premium to the closing price of the company s common stock on the date that the convertible notes were priced to investors and  therefore  mitigate the potential dilution of our common stock upon conversion of the notes  if any 

table of contents no shares of our common stock have been issued or received under the purchased options or the warrants 
since the price of our common stock was less than at december   the intrinsic value of both the purchased options and the warrants  as expressed in shares of the company s common stock  was zero 
changes in the price of the company s common stock will impact the share settlement of the notes  the purchased options and the warrants as illustrated below shares in thousands net share entitlement shares shares issuable under the issuable potential company under the purchased under net shares eps stock price notes options the warrants issuable dilution in thousands for dilutive earnings per share calculations  we will be required to include the dilutive effect  if applicable  of the net shares issuable under the notes and the warrants as depicted in the table above under the heading potential eps dilution 
although the purchased options have the economic benefit of decreasing the dilutive effect of the notes  for earnings per share purposes we cannot factor this benefit into our dilutive shares outstanding as their impact would be anti dilutive 
stock repurchases 
in march  our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to million of our common stock  subject to management s judgment and the restrictions of our various debt agreements 
in june  this authorization was replaced with a million authorization concurrent with the issuance of the notes 
in conjunction with the issuance of the notes  we repurchased  shares of our common stock at an average price of per share  exhausting the entire million authorization 
in addition  under separate authorization  in march  the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of a number of shares equivalent to the shares issued pursuant to the company s employee stock purchase plan on a quarterly basis 
pursuant to this authorization  a total of  shares were repurchased during  at a cost of approximately million 
approximately million of the funds for such repurchases came from employee contributions during the period 
in march  our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to million of our stock  subject to management s judgment and the restrictions of our various debt agreements 
as of december   million remained under the board of directors march authorization 
during  we repurchased  shares of our common stock for approximately million  thereby completing the previously authorized repurchase program 

table of contents future repurchases are subject to the discretion of our board of directors after considering our results of operations  financial condition  cash flows  capital requirements  outlook for our business  general business conditions and other factors 
dividends 
prior to  we had never declared or paid dividends on our common stock 
during  our board of directors declared dividends of per common share for the fourth quarter of and per common share for the first  second and third quarters of these dividend payments on our outstanding common stock and common stock equivalents totaled approximately million for the year ended december  the payment of any future dividend is subject to the discretion of our board of directors after considering our results of operations  financial condition  cash flows  capital requirements  outlook for our business  general business conditions and other factors 
provisions of our credit facilities and our senior subordinated notes require us to maintain certain financial ratios and limit the amount of disbursements we may make outside the ordinary course of business 
these include limitations on the payment of cash dividends and on stock repurchases  which are limited to a percentage of cumulative net income 
as of december   our revolving credit facility  the most restrictive agreement with respect to such limits  limited future dividends and stock repurchases to million 
this amount will increase or decrease in future periods by adding to the current limitation the sum of of our consolidated net income  if positive  and of equity issuances  less actual dividends or stock repurchases completed in each quarterly period 
our revolving credit facility matures in and our senior subordinated notes mature in contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total year years years thereafter in thousands floorplan notes payable long term debt obligations estimated interest payments on floorplan notes payable estimated interest payments on long term debt obligations operating leases purchase commitments total includes million of outstanding letters of credit 
estimated interest payments were calculated using the floorplan balance and weighted average interest rate at december   and the assumption that these liabilities would be settled within days which approximates our weighted average inventory days supply 
estimated interest payments on long term debt obligations includes fixed rate interest on our senior subordinated notes due  and our convertible notes due includes capital expenditures  acquisition commitments and other 
we  acting through our subsidiaries  are the lessee under many real estate leases that provide for our use of the respective dealership premises 
generally  our real estate and facility leases have year total terms with initial terms of years and three additional five year terms  at our option 
pursuant to these leases  our subsidiaries generally agree to indemnify the lessor and other parties from certain liabilities arising as a result of the use of the leased premises  including environmental liabilities  or a breach of the lease by the lessee 
additionally  from time to time  we enter into agreements in connection with the sale of assets or businesses in which we agree to indemnify the purchaser  or other parties  from certain liabilities or costs arising in connection with the assets or business 
also  in the ordinary course of business in connection with purchases or sales of goods and services  we enter into 
table of contents agreements that may contain indemnification provisions 
in the event that an indemnification claim is asserted  liability would be limited by the terms of the applicable agreement 
from time to time  primarily in connection with dealership dispositions  our subsidiaries assign or sublet to the dealership purchaser the subsidiaries interests in any real property leases associated with such stores 
in general  our subsidiaries retain responsibility for the performance of certain obligations under such leases to the extent that the assignee or sublessee does not perform  whether such performance is required prior to or following the assignment or subletting of the lease 
additionally  we and our subsidiaries generally remain subject to the terms of any guarantees made by us and our subsidiaries in connection with such leases 
although we generally have indemnification rights against the assignee or sublessee in the event of non performance under these leases  as well as certain defenses  and we presently have no reason to believe that we or our subsidiaries will be called on to perform under any such assigned leases or subleases  we estimate that lessee rental payment obligations during the remaining terms of these leases are approximately million at december  we and our subsidiaries also may be called on to perform other obligations under these leases  such as environmental remediation of the leased premises or repair of the leased premises upon termination of the lease  although we presently have no reason to believe that we or our subsidiaries will be called on to so perform and such obligations cannot be quantified at this time 
our exposure under these leases is difficult to estimate and there can be no assurance that any performance of us or our subsidiaries required under these leases would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following information about our market sensitive financial instruments constitutes a forward looking statement 
our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates 
our policy is to manage interest rate exposure through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
at december   fixed rate debt  primarily consisting of our convertible senior notes and senior subordinated notes outstanding  totaled million and had a fair value of million 
at december   we had million of variable rate floorplan borrowings outstanding 
based on this amount  a basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate million change to our interest expense 
after consideration of the interest rate swaps described below  a basis point increase would yield a net increase of million 
we received million of interest assistance from certain automobile manufacturers during the year ended december  this assistance is reflected as a million reduction of our new vehicle cost of sales for the year ended december   and reduced our new vehicle inventory by million and million at december  and  respectively 
for the past three years  the reduction to our new vehicle cost of sales has ranged from approximately to of our floorplan interest expense 
although we can provide no assurance as to the amount of future interest assistance  it is our expectation  based on historical data that an increase in prevailing interest rates would result in increased assistance from certain manufacturers 
we may use interest rate swaps to adjust our exposure to interest rate movements when appropriate based upon market conditions 
these swaps are entered into with financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings  thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss 
we reflect the current fair value of all derivatives on our balance sheet 
the related gains or losses on these transactions are deferred in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the related items being hedged are recognized in expense 
however  to the extent that the change in value of a derivative contract does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the items being hedged  that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in income 
all of our interest rate hedges are designated as cash flow hedges 
in december  we entered into two interest rate swaps with notional values of million each  and in january  we entered into a third interest rate swap with a notional value of million 
the hedge instruments are designed to convert floating rate vehicle floorplan payables under our revolving credit facility to fixed rate debt 
one swap  with million in notional value  effectively locks in a rate of  the second swap  also with million in notional value  effectively locks in a rate of  and the third swap  with million in notional value  effectively locks in a rate of 
all three of these hedge instruments expire december  at december  
table of contents  net unrealized gains  net of income taxes  related to hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss totaled million 
at december   net unrealized losses  net of income taxes  related to hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss totaled million 
for the year ended december   the income statement impact from interest rate hedges was an additional expense of million 
at december  and  all of our derivative contracts were determined to be highly effective  and no ineffective portion was recognized in income
