fiscal developments  future objectives and challenges gpu business the combination of our geforce  geforce and geforce series of gpus and our scalable link interface  or sli  technology has created a new class of gaming pcs and professional workstations 
sli technology takes advantage of the increased bandwidth of the peripheral component interconnect  or pci  express bus architecture to allow up to four nvidia based graphics cards to operate in a single pc or up to two nvidia based graphics cards to operate in a notebook pc or professional workstation 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we shipped eight new geforce series gpus for desktop and notebook pcs  expanding the offering of products in the geforce gpu family 
in march  we shipped our first quad sli system for desktop pcs  enabling the use of four gpus per system 
we also shipped the geforce go gtx notebook gpu featuring sli technology for notebook pcs 
during the second quarter of fiscal  our nvidia geforce go notebook gpu product line achieved record revenue for the second consecutive quarter 
in addition  our nvidia quadro professional product line increased its revenue from the second quarter of fiscal we transitioned from our nvidia geforce to the nvidia geforce  which delivers almost a performance increase at the same price point 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we continued to experience growth in sales of our geforce series products  primarily in the mainstream and performance segments 
our nvidia geforce go notebook gpu product line achieved record revenue for the third consecutive quarter  primarily through increased sales in the notebook standalone gpu segment 
in june  we shipped the geforce gx  which provides x resolution 
this is the resolution of cinematic film  and brings the panoramic experience of cinema to gaming 
we also announced purevideo high definition  or hd technology  a combination of hardware acceleration from an nvidia gpu  high definition movie player integration and high bandwidth digital content protection  or hdcp  feature support  to enable manufacturers and consumers to build pcs that can play high definition digital video disc  or hd dvd or blu ray movies 
in august  we introduced the nvidia quadro plex  the world s first dedicated visual computing system 
the nvidia quadro plex offers scalability in a desktop or dense u rackmount configuration for professional applications such as those powering multiple streams of k high definition video  d styling and design  scientific and medical visualization  oil and gas exploration  or visual simulation and training 
in november  we introduced our geforce series gpus  which is based on a unified shader architecture 
instead of separate vertex and pixel shading processors  the geforce has stream processors  operating at ghz  that can process either vertex or pixel shader programs 
geforce is also the world s first dx gpu 
dx is a new application programming interface  or api  for microsoft windows vista  or vista  and includes many new features 
we also announced compute unified device architecture  or cuda  a new mode of operation on gpus where the computational power of the gpu can be utilized for computation intensive applications 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we extended our leadership share position in the notebook gpu segment to share  according to the mercury research fourth quarter pc graphics report 
notebook gpu revenue grew over year over year 
additionally  the nvidia quadro professional product line achieved record revenue with a revenue increase from the fourth quarter fiscal mcp business in february  we completed our acquisition of uli electronics  inc  or uli  a core logic developer for the pc industry 
this acquisition represents our ongoing investment in our platform solution strategy and has strengthened our sales  marketing  and customer engineering presence in taiwan and china 
in march  we shipped our first integrated graphics processor  or igp  core logic solution for advanced micro devices  inc  or amd  based notebook pcs the geforce go gpu and nvidia nforce go mcp 
this core logic solution is the industry s first high definition igp to provide hardware accelerated h

in march  we acquired hybrid graphics ltd  or hybrid graphics  a developer of embedded d and d graphics software for handheld devices 
in june  we launched our mobilemedia platform for handheld devices running windows mobile the mobilemedia platform is a development kit  containing both software and hardware components  that enables handheld manufacturers to design and release digital media rich devices with windows mobile in january  we completed our acquisition of portalplayer  inc  or portalplayer 
until recently  our handheld gpu strategy has been to focus on establishing ourselves in the market as the leader of multimedia technology by leveraging our expertise in graphics  video  and image processing 
with the acquisition of portalplayer s expertise in building low power application processors for personal media players  or pmps  we are now focused on delivering systems on a chip  or socs  that combine our application processors and gpus 
we expect socs such as these to power next generation smart phone and pmp devices 
consumer electronics business we record license revenue from our initial agreement with sce to jointly develop a custom gpu for sce s playstation computer entertainment system  as well as from certain additional agreements with them 
in addition  we record royalty revenue from sce based on per unit sales of the playstation  which was launched by sce in november gross margin improvement we continue to remain focused on improving our gross margin 
beginning in fiscal  we implemented profit improvement initiatives across our company which were designed to improve business and operational processes 
during fiscal  our gross margin was  which represents an increase of over basis points from our gross margin of for fiscal our gross margin was for fiscal  which represents an increase of basis points from our gross margin of for fiscal we will continue to focus on improving our gross margin during fiscal restatement on november   we restated our previously issued financial statements for fiscal years through  and for the first quarter of fiscal  together with selected financial statement items for earlier years  to correct errors related to accounting for stock based compensation expense 
in june  the audit committee of the board of nvidia  or the audit committee  began a review of our stock option practices based on the results of an internal review voluntarily undertaken by management 
the audit committee  with the assistance of outside legal counsel  completed its review on november  when the audit committee reported its findings to our board of directors  or the board 
the review covered option grants to all employees  directors and consultants for all grant dates during the period from our initial public offering in january through june based on the findings of the audit committee and our internal review  we identified a number of occasions on which we used an incorrect measurement date for financial accounting and reporting purposes 
these errors resulted primarily from our use during our fiscal years  and  of certain date selection methods discussed below which resulted in employees receiving options with stated exercise prices lower than the market prices as measured based upon the actual grant dates 
we ceased using such practices beginning in our fiscal year the audit committee found that  beginning in our fiscal year  we improved our stock option grant processes and have generally granted and priced our employee stock options in an objective and consistent manner since that time 
however  for one company wide annual stock option grant we made in fiscal  we did not finalize the number of options allocated to each employee as of the stated grant date in may  which resulted in stock based compensation charges due to the change in the measurement date to the date the grants were finalized 
the audit committee s review did not identify any additional stock based compensation charges from measurement date issues subsequent to that fiscal grant 
as a result of the measurement date errors identified from the audit committee s review  through january   we recorded aggregate non cash stock based compensation charges of million  net of related tax effects 
the errors resulted in after tax charges of million and million for our fiscal years and  respectively 
additionally  the cumulative effect of the related after tax charges for periods prior to our fiscal year ended january  was million 
these additional stock based compensation expense charges were non cash and had no impact on our reported revenue  cash  cash equivalents or marketable securities for each of the restated periods 
these charges were based primarily on accounting principles board opinion no 
 or apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees intrinsic value based charges and associated payroll taxes of million on a pre tax basis  which were amortized over the vesting term of the stock options in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 or fin  accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans 
we amortized a substantial portion of these charges to expense during our fiscal years to the types of errors we identified generally fell into the following categories improper measurement dates for company wide annual or retention stock option grants 
we determined that  in connection with certain annual or retention stock option grants that we made to employees during our fiscal years    and  the final number of shares that an individual employee was entitled to receive was not determined and or the proper approval of the related stock option grant had not been given until after the stated grant date 
therefore  the measurement date for such options for accounting purposes was actually subsequent to the stated grant date  resulting in new measurement dates for the related options 
improper measurement dates for stock option grants during fiscal years and in connection with stock option grants that we made to newly hired employees and  to a much lesser degree  retention grants to existing employees during fiscal years and  our practice was to grant stock options with an exercise price based upon the lowest closing price of our common stock in the last few days of the month of hire or the last few days of any subsequent month in the quarter of hire 
the selection of the grant date of the related option grants would be made at the end of the fiscal quarter and was based on achieving the lowest exercise price for the affected employees 
as a result of these practices  the measurement date for such options for accounting purposes was actually subsequent to the stated grant date  resulting in new measurement dates for the related options 
improper measurement dates for stock option grants during fiscal year in connection with certain stock option grants to newly hired employees and  to a much lesser degree  retention grants to existing employees during a portion of fiscal year  our practice was to delay the selection of the related grant dates until the end of a two month period in the fiscal quarter during which the employees who received the grants began their employment with nvidia 
as a result of this practice  the exercise price of the related option grants was not determined until subsequent to the stated grant date 
we also determined that  during fiscal year  we generally set the grant date and exercise price of employee option grants for new hires and promotions at the lowest price of the last few business days of the month of their hire or promotion or of the following month in certain two month periods that were chosen for an indeterminate reason 
as a result of these practices  the measurement date for such options for accounting purposes was actually subsequent to the stated grant date  resulting in new measurement dates for the related options 
in addition  we also determined that the exercise price or the number of options to be granted had not been determined  or the proper approval had not been given  for various other miscellaneous option grants during fiscal year until after the stated grant date resulting in new measurement dates for accounting purposes for the related options 
other issues identified 
we also identified instances where stock option grants did not comply with applicable terms and conditions of the stock plans from which the grants were issued 
for example  two grants were made to officers of nvidia by the chief executive officer under delegated authority  however  under the terms of the applicable plan  the option grant should have been made by our board or the compensation committee 
there were also instances where option grants were made to a small group of employees who joined nvidia pursuant to a business combination  and to a few other employees in certain instances  with stated exercise prices below the fair market value of our common stock on the actual measurement date of the related grants  and option grants were made to a few individuals who were contractors rather than employees  without recording the appropriate accounting charges 
in addition  the audit committee did not find any evidence that these violations were committed for improper purposes

the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  cost of revenue  expenses and related disclosure of contingencies 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  inventories  income taxes  and goodwill 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board 
the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition product revenue we recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
for most sales  we use a binding purchase order and in certain cases we use a contractual agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
we consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
at the point of sale  we assess whether the arrangement fee is fixed and determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
our policy on sales to distributors is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributors resell the product 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs at the time revenue is recognized 
our customer programs primarily involve rebates  which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets 
we account for rebates in accordance with emerging issues task force issue  or eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products and  as such  we accrue for of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor 
rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale  unless we reasonably believe that the customer intends to claim the rebate 
unclaimed rebates are reversed to revenue upon expiration of the rebate 
our customer programs also include marketing development funds  or mdfs 
we account for mdfs as either a reduction of revenue or an operating expense in accordance with eitf mdfs represent monies paid to retailers  system builders  oems  distributors and add in card partners that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partners activities while also promoting nvidia products 
if market conditions decline  we may take actions to increase amounts offered under customer programs  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time such programs are offered 
we also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized  based primarily on historical return rates 
however  if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns 
license and development revenue for license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components  we generally recognize this license revenue using the percentage of completion method of accounting over the period that services are performed 
for all license and service arrangements accounted for under the percentage of completion method  we determine progress to completion based on actual direct labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total direct labor hours required to complete the project 
we periodically evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates to complete each contract remain accurate 
a provision for estimated losses on contracts is made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated 
to date  we have not recorded any such losses 
costs incurred in advance of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred costs on uncompleted contracts 
if the amount billed exceeds the amount of revenue recognized  the excess amount is recorded as deferred revenue 
revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress 
significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total direct labor hours 
any changes in or deviations from these estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any period 
accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
management determines this allowance  which consists of an amount identified for specific customer issues as well as an amount based on general estimated exposure 
our overall estimated exposure excludes significant amounts that are covered by credit insurance and letters of credit 
if the financial condition of our customers  the financial institutions providing letters of credit  or our credit insurance carrier were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required that could adversely affect our operating results 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain credit insurance in the future 
our current credit insurance agreement expires on december as of january   our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was million and our gross accounts receivable balance was million 
of the million  million was covered by credit insurance and million was covered by letters of credit 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required and we may have to record additional reserves or write offs on certain sales transactions in the future 
as a percentage of our gross accounts receivable balance  our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable has ranged between and during fiscal years and factors impacting the allowance include the level of gross receivables  the financial condition of our customers and the extent to which balances are covered by credit insurance or letters of credit 
as of january   our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable represented of our gross accounts receivable balance 
if our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable balance had been recorded at the high end of the range  at of our gross receivable balance  then our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable balance at january   would have been approximately million  rather than the actual balance of million 
inventories inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis  which approximates actual cost on an average or first in  first out basis 
we write down our inventory for estimated lower of cost or market  obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand  future product purchase commitments  estimated manufacturing yield levels and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  or if our future product purchase commitments to our suppliers exceed our forecasted future demand for such products  additional future inventory write downs may be required that could adversely affect our operating results 
if actual market conditions are more favorable  we may have higher gross margins when products are sold 
sales to date of such products have not had a significant impact on our gross margin 
as of january   our inventory reserve was million 
as a percentage of our gross inventory balance  our inventory reserve has ranged between and during fiscal years and as of january   our inventory reserve represented of our gross inventory balance 
if our inventory reserve balance had been recorded at the high end of the range  at of our gross inventory balance  then our inventory reserve balance at january   would have been approximately million  rather than the actual balance of million 
inventory reserves once established are not reversed until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped 
income taxes statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we recognize federal  state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction 
we also recognize federal  state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities  as appropriate  for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards  and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence and judgment  are not expected to be realized 
united states income tax has not been provided on earnings of our non us subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested 
our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based  in part  on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome  changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the united states  or foreign jurisdictions where we operate  or changes in other facts or circumstances 
in addition  we recognize liabilities for potential united states and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes may be due 
if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment  we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements  accordingly 
as of january   we had a valuation allowance of million 
of the total valuation allowance  million relates to state tax attributes acquired in certain acquisitions for which realization of the related deferred tax assets was determined not likely to be realized due  in part  to potential utilization limitations as a result of stock ownership changes  and million relates to state deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to be realized due  in part  to projections of future taxable income 
to the extent realization of the deferred tax assets related to certain acquisitions becomes probable  recognition of these acquired tax benefits would first reduce goodwill to zero  then reduce other non current intangible assets related to the acquisition to zero with any remaining benefit reported as a reduction to income tax expense 
to the extent realization of the deferred tax assets related to state tax benefits becomes probable  we would recognize an income tax benefit in the period such asset is more likely than not to be realized 
as of january   with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  or sfas no 
r  share based payment  we have derecognized both deferred tax assets for the excess of tax benefit related to stock based compensation  reflected in our federal and state net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards  and the offsetting valuation allowance 
consistent with prior years  the excess tax benefit reflected in our net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards  in the amount of million as of january   will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders equity  if and when realized 
in determining if and when excess tax benefits have been realized  we have elected to do so on a with and without approach with respect to such excess tax benefits 
we have also elected to ignore the indirect tax effects of stock based compensation deductions for financial and accounting reporting purposes  and specifically to recognize the full effect of the research tax credit in income from continuing operations 
goodwill our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value 
we determined that our reporting units are equivalent to our operating segments for the purposes of completing our statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  impairment test 
we utilize a two step approach to testing goodwill for impairment 
the first step tests for possible impairment by applying a fair value based test 
in computing fair value of our reporting units  we use estimates of future revenues  costs and cash flows from such units 
the second step  if necessary  measures the amount of such an impairment by applying fair value based tests to individual assets and liabilities 
we elected to perform our annual goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
we completed our most recent annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal and concluded that there was no impairment 
however  future events or circumstances may result in a charge to earnings in future periods due to the potential for a write down of goodwill in connection with such tests 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r which establishes accounting for stock based awards exchanged for employee services 
accordingly  stock based compensation cost is measured at grant date  based on the fair value of the awards  and is recognized as expense over the requisite employee service period 
stock based compensation expense recognized during fiscal was million  which consisted of stock based compensation expense related to stock options and our employee stock purchase plan 
please refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
we elected to adopt the modified prospective application method beginning january  as provided by sfas no 
r 
we recognize stock based compensation expense using the straight line attribution method 
we estimate the value of employee stock options on the date of grant using a lattice binomial model 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we recorded stock based compensation expense equal to the amount that would have been recognized if the fair value method was used  for the purpose of the pro forma financial information provided in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosures 
at the beginning of fiscal  we transitioned from a black scholes model to a binomial model for calculating the estimated fair value of new stock based compensation awards granted under our stock option plans 
the determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  vesting schedules  death and disability probabilities  expected volatility and risk free interest 
our management determined that the use of implied volatility is expected to be more reflective of market conditions and  therefore  could reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of our expected volatility than historical volatility 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the term of our employee stock options 
the dividend yield assumption is based on the history and expectation of dividend payouts 
we began segregating options into groups for employees with relatively homogeneous exercise behavior in order to calculate the best estimate of fair value using the binomial valuation model 
using the lattice binomial model  the fair value of the stock options granted under our stock option plans have been estimated using the following assumptions during the year ended january  weighted average expected life of stock options in years risk free interest rate volatility dividend yield for our employee stock purchase plan we continue to use the black scholes model 
the fair value of the shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan has been estimated using the following assumptions during year ended january  weighted average expected life of stock options in years risk free interest rate volatility dividend yield sfas no 
r also requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas no 
r in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under sfas no 
r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
litigation  investigation and settlement costs from time to time  we are involved in legal actions and or investigations by regulatory bodies 
we are aggressively defending our current litigation matters 
however  there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigations  and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation  fines and or substantial settlement payments 
if that occurs  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation  investigations or settlements is probable  and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events  we will record the loss in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
however  the actual liability in any such litigation or investigations may be materially different from our estimates  which could require us to record additional costs 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items in our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of revenue 
year ended january  january  january  revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development sales  general and administrative settlement costs total operating expenses income from operations interest and other income  net income before income tax expense income tax expense net income fiscal years ended january   january   and january  revenue we report financial information for four product line operating segments to our chief executive officer  who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker  as follows the gpu business  the mcp business  the handheld gpu business  and the consumer electronics business 
revenue in the all other category is primarily derived from sales of memory devices 
please refer to note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
fiscal was a week year  compared to fiscal years and which were week years  and we believe that this extra week may have had a positive impact on our revenue in fiscal however  we are not able to quantify the effect of the slightly longer year on our fiscal revenue 
fiscal year vs 
fiscal year revenue was billion for fiscal  compared to billion for fiscal  which represents an increase of 
a discussion of our revenue results for each of our operating segments is as follows gpu business 
gpu business revenue increased by to billion for fiscal  compared to billion for fiscal the increase was a result of increased sales of our desktop gpu products  notebook products and our nvidia professional workstation products 
the increase in sales of our desktop gpu products was led by our geforce based and geforce based products that serve the high end segment 
sales of our nvidia notebook products improved due to an increased mix of geforce based products  shipping for notebook pc design wins based on intel s napa platform 
this increase in sales was slightly offset by a decrease in average selling prices

microsoft s next generation operating system  microsoft windows vista  or vista  has shipped 
we believe that vista is the first operating system to present  as a standard  the power of the gpu to all applications and that  in the future  a significant percentage of pcs will have vista 
with vista  dx  and hd blu ray dvd as the technologies for pcs for the coming year  we believe that d graphics will become a central part of the computing experience and that the gpu will be more important than ever 
however  to date we have not seen a significant impact from the launch of vista

as a result  we recognized revenue from the sale of our xbox related products to microsoft for the last time during the second quarter of fiscal during fiscal  we recognized million of revenue from our contractual arrangements with sce to jointly develop a custom gpu for sce s playstation no such revenue was recognized during our fiscal as our definitive agreement with sce was not executed until the first quarter of fiscal concentration of revenue revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states and other americas accounted for  and of total revenue for fiscal   and  respectively 
revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the foreign contract equipment manufacturers  or cems  add in board and motherboard manufacturers revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location 
the increase in the percentage of revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states and other americas for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to discontinued sales of xgpus and mcps used in the microsoft xbox product during fiscal  which were billed to microsoft in the united states 
sales to our significant customers accounted for approximately of our total revenue from one customer during fiscal year  of our total revenue from two customers during fiscal year  and of our total revenue from two customers during fiscal year gross profit gross profit consists of total revenue  net of allowances  less cost of revenue

our geforce and our geforce series gpus generally have higher gross margins than our previous generations of gpus 
mcp business 
the gross margin of our mcp business decreased during fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a shift in product mix to higher volumes of integrated amd based desktop products which have experienced lower gross margins than our discrete mcp products  and inventory reserves that we recorded as a charge to cost of revenue that primarily related to purchase commitments that we believed had exceeded future demand 
handheld gpu business

stock repurchase program on august  we announced that our board had authorized a stock repurchase program to repurchase shares of our common stock  subject to certain specifications  up to an aggregate maximum amount of million 
subsequently  on march   we announced that our board had approved a million increase to the original stock repurchase program 
as a result of this increase  the amount of common stock the board has authorized to be repurchased has now been increased to a total of million

the program does not obligate nvidia to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion 
as part of our share repurchase program  we have entered into and we may continue to enter into structured share repurchase transactions with financial institutions

operating capital and capital expenditure requirements we believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating  acquisition and capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  there is no assurance that we will not need to raise additional equity or debt financing within this time frame 
additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and may be dilutive to our then current stockholders 
we also may require additional capital for other purposes not presently contemplated 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital  we could be required to curtail capital equipment purchases or research and development expenditures  which could harm our business 
factors that could affect our cash used or generated from operations and  as a result  our need to seek additional borrowings or capital include decreased demand and market acceptance for our products and or our customers products  inability to successfully develop and produce in volume production our next generation products  competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices  and new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors

dfx asset purchase on december   nvidia corporation and one of our indirect subsidiaries entered into an agreement  which closed on april   to purchase certain graphics chip assets from dfx 
under the terms of the asset purchase agreement  the cash consideration due at the closing was million  less million that was loaned to dfx pursuant to a credit agreement dated december  the asset purchase agreement also provided  subject to the other provisions thereof  that if dfx properly certified that all its debts and other liabilities had been provided for  then we would have been obligated to pay dfx two million shares of nvidia common stock 
if dfx could not make such a certification  but instead properly certified that its debts and liabilities could be satisfied for less than million  then dfx could have elected to receive a cash payment equal to the amount of such debts and liabilities and a reduced number of shares of our common stock  with such reduction calculated by dividing the cash payment by per share 
if dfx could not certify that all of its debts and liabilities had been provided for  or could not be satisfied  for less than million  we would not be obligated under the agreement to pay any additional consideration for the assets 
in october  dfx filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of california 
in march  we were served with a complaint filed by the trustee appointed by the bankruptcy court which sought  among other things  payments from us as additional purchase price related to our purchase of certain assets of dfx 
in early november  after many months of mediation  nvidia and the official committee of unsecured creditors  or the creditors committee  reached a conditional settlement of the trustee s claims against nvidia 
this conditional settlement  presented as the centerpiece of a proposed plan of liquidation in the bankruptcy case  was subject to a confirmation process through a vote of creditors and the review and approval of the bankruptcy court after notice and hearing 
the trustee advised that he intended to object to the settlement  which would have called for a payment by nvidia of approximately million to the dfx estate 
under the settlement  million related to various administrative expenses and trustee fees  and million related to the satisfaction of debts and liabilities owed to the general unsecured creditors of dfx 
accordingly  during the three month period ended october   we recorded million as a charge to settlement costs and million as additional purchase price for dfx 
however  the conditional settlement never progressed substantially through the confirmation process 
on december   the bankruptcy court determined that it would schedule trial of one portion of the trustee s case against nvidia 
on january   nvidia exercised its right to terminate the settlement agreement on grounds that the bankruptcy court had failed to proceed toward confirmation of the creditors committee s plan 
beginning on march   nvidia and the trustee are scheduled to try the question of the value of the assets dfx conveyed to nvidia and  in particular  whether the price nvidia paid for those assets was reasonably equivalent to the value of the assets dfx sold to nvidia

recently issued accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued interpretation no

fin applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to fasb statement  accounting for income taxes 
under fin a company would recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position 
fin clarifies how a company would measure the income tax benefits from the tax positions that are recognized  provides guidance as to the timing of the derecognition of previously recognized tax benefits  and describes the methods for classifying and disclosing the liabilities within the financial statements for any unrecognized tax benefits 
fin also addresses when a company should record interest and penalties related to tax positions and how the interest and penalties may be classified within the financial statements 
any differences between tax liability amounts recognized in the statements of operations as a result of adoption of fin would be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the provisions of fin will be effective as of first quarter of fiscal we believe that the cumulative effect of adoption of fin will not result in any material change to the beginning balance of our retained earnings

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we invest in a variety of financial instruments  consisting principally of investments in commercial paper  money market funds and highly liquid debt securities of corporations  municipalities and the united states government and its agencies 
these investments are denominated in united states dollars 
we account for our investment instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
all of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as available for sale under sfas no 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
however  because we classify our debt securities as available for sale  no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other than temporary 
these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity  net of tax 
as of january   we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments 
according to our analysis  parallel shifts in the yield curve of both would result in changes in fair market values for these investments of approximately million 
exchange rate risk we consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal 
currently  sales and arrangements with third party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in united states dollars  and  therefore  are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations 
increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive  which could negatively impact our ability to compete 
conversely  decreases in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us 
to date  we have not engaged in any currency hedging activities  although we may do so in the future 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future
