item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations  which gives effect to the restatement discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this report 
our actual results could differ materially from those contained in these forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those discussed in risk factors in part  item a and elsewhere in this report 
restatement of consolidated financial statements background we announced on october  that the company s board of directors had appointed an options subcommittee  comprised of independent directors  to conduct a review of the company s stock options 
certain present and former directors and executive officers of the company were named as defendants in a derivative lawsuit related to stock option practices from to  filed in superior court  county of maricopa  arizona on september  the company had been named as a nominal defendant in that action 
on december   we filed a motion to dismiss the complaint based on plaintiff s failure to make a pre suit demand on the company s board of directors 
before the opposition to the motion was due  the plaintiff voluntarily asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit  and  on january   the court granted the plaintiff s motion to voluntarily dismiss the lawsuit without prejudice 
in addition  we announced on november  that on october   the company received an informal inquiry from the sec requesting certain documents and information relating to the company s stock option granting practices from january  to the present 
the options subcommittee was assisted by independent legal counsel and independent forensic accounting consultants 
at the conclusion of its review  the options subcommittee reported its findings to the company s board of directors and to kpmg llp  the company s independent registered public accounting firm  on march  and march   respectively 
management  assisted by its own independent legal counsel and independent forensic consultants  then undertook an analysis of the results of the options subcommittee s review  as well as all stock option activity during the period after the company s initial public offering on january  through november   the last date on which we granted stock options the relevant period 
in a form k filed on april   we reported that based on the findings of the options subcommittee and the conclusions reached to date by management in its analysis  our previously issued financial statements would require restatement and should no longer be relied upon 
we determined  based upon the options subcommittee s review and the company s analysis  that for accounting purposes  the dates initially used to measure compensation expense for various stock option grants to employees  executive officers and outside non employee directors during the period could not be relied upon 
the revised measurement dates identified for accounting purposes differed from the originally selected measurement dates due primarily to i insufficient or incomplete approvals  ii inadequate or incomplete establishment of the terms of the grants  including the list of individual recipients  and iii the use of hindsight to select exercise prices 
the restated consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k reflect the corrections resulting from our determination 
we have incurred substantial expenses related to the options subcommittee s review and the company s analysis 
we have incurred approximately million in costs for legal fees  external audit firm fees and external consulting fees through june  and anticipate approximately million in additional fees will be incurred through august in the completion of financial statement restatement and related matters 
in addition to the restatements for stock based compensation  we recorded an adjustment for million to record a legal settlement expense that was recorded in the first quarter of  which should have been recorded in the fourth quarter of the tax effect of this adjustment was million

restatement adjustments our restated consolidated financial statements contained in this form k incorporate stock based compensation expense  including the income tax impacts related to the restatement adjustments 
the restatement adjustments result in a million reduction of retained earnings as of december  this amount includes reductions in our consolidated net earnings of approximately million for each of the years ended december  and the total restatement impact for the years ended december  through december   of million  net of related tax benefits of million  has been reflected as a prior period adjustment to beginning retained earnings as of january  the total unamortized pre tax stock based compensation was less than million at december  in addition to the restatements for stock based compensation  we recorded a pre tax adjustment for million to record a legal settlement expense that was recorded in the first quarter of  which should have been recorded in the fourth quarter of the tax effect of this adjustment was million

the revised measurement dates identified for accounting purposes differed from the originally selected measurement dates due primarily to i insufficient or incomplete approvals  ii inadequate or incomplete establishment of the terms of the grants  including the list of individual recipients  and iii the use of hindsight to select exercise prices 
specifically  for each of the categories of option grants discussed in more detail under accounting considerations below  we noted the following stock option grants with insufficient or incomplete approvals 
the company determined that the original recorded grant date could not be relied on because there was correspondence or other evidence that indicated that not all required approvals had been obtained  including for certain grants  compensation committee approval 
the company remeasured these option grants with a revised measurement date supported by the required level of approval  as described below  and accounted for these grants as fixed awards under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no

inadequate or incomplete establishment of the terms of the grants 
the company determined that for certain stock option grants  the number of shares and the exercise price were not known with finality at the original measurement date 
the company determined that the original recorded grant date could not be relied on because there was correspondence or other evidence that indicated that the company had not finalized the number of stock options allocated to each individual recipient and the related exercise price 
based on available supporting documentation  the company determined the date by which the number of stock options to be awarded to each recipient was finalized and the other terms of the award were established and accounted for these grants as fixed awards under apb no 
the use of hindsight to select exercise prices 
as noted below  the company followed an informal policy of awarding options to individual employees in recognition of the anniversary of their employment with the company or in conjunction with employee promotions using hindsight to select the exercise price 
in many instances  little or no documentation to support dates selected for option grants could be located by the company 
further  instances of favorable  retrospective date selection of discretionary grants were identified 
also  as noted below  the investigation noted instances of inadequate documentation  or retrospective date selection  relating to the award of grants to the company s top three executive officers  all of which required compensation committee approval 
based on available supporting documentation  the company determined a revised measurement date and accounted for these grants as fixed awards under apb no 
other miscellaneous accounting adjustments in addition to the restatements for stock based compensation  we recorded a pre tax adjustment for million to record a legal settlement expense that was recorded in the first quarter of  which should have been recorded in the fourth quarter of the tax effect of this adjustment was million 
income tax benefit we recorded a net income tax benefit of approximately million in connection with the stock option related compensation charges during the period from fiscal year to december  this tax benefit has resulted in an increase of our deferred tax assets for most us affected stock options prior to the exercise or forfeiture of the related options 
with the exception of uk employees exercising options after  the company recorded no tax benefit or deferred tax asset for affected stock options granted to non us employees because we determined that we could not receive tax benefits for these options 
further  we limited the deferred tax assets recorded for affected stock options granted to certain highly paid officers to reflect estimated limitations on tax deductibility under internal revenue code section m 
upon exercise or forfeiture of the underlying options  the excess or deficiency in deferred tax assets is written off to paid in capital in the period of exercise or forfeiture 
payroll taxes  interest and penalties management is considering possible ways to address the impact that section a of the internal revenue code may have as a result of the exercise price of stock options being less than the fair market value of our common stock on the revised measurement date 
section a imposes additional taxes to our employees on stock options granted with an exercise price lower than the fair market value on the date of grant that vest after december  the internal revenue service has issued transition rules under section a that allows for a correction  or cure  for options subject to section a 
we may offer the holders of outstanding options the opportunity to affect a cure of all affected stock options 
in connection with this cure  we may make cash bonus payments in an aggregate amount of up to  in to our non officer employees 
accounting considerations stock based compensation we originally accounted for all employee  officer and director stock option grants as fixed grants under apb no 
 using a measurement date of the recorded grant date 
we issued all grants with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the recorded grant date  and therefore originally recorded no stock based compensation expense 
as a result of the findings of the options subcommittee  and our own further review of our stock option granting practices  we determined that the measurement dates for certain stock option grants differed from the recorded grant dates for such grants 
based on the analysis described below  the company concluded that it was appropriate to revise the measurement dates for these grants based upon its findings 
the company calculated stock based compensation expense under apb no 
based upon the intrinsic value as of the adjusted measurement dates of stock option awards determined to be fixed under apb no 
and the vesting provisions of the underlying options 
the company calculated the intrinsic value on the adjusted measurement date as the closing price of its common stock on such date as reported on the nasdaq national market  now the nasdaq global select market  less the exercise price per share of common stock as stated in the underlying stock option agreement  multiplied by the number of shares subject to such stock option award 
the company recognizes these amounts as compensation expense over the vesting period of the underlying options in accordance with the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans 
we also determined that variable accounting treatment was appropriate under apb no 
for certain stock option grants for which evidence was obtained that the terms of the options may have been communicated to those recipients 
table of contents insight enterprises  inc 
and that those terms were subsequently modified stock option grants cancelled and repriced 
when variable accounting is applied to stock option grants  we remeasure  and report in our consolidated statements of earnings  the intrinsic value of the options at the end of each reporting period until the options are exercised  cancelled or expire unexercised 
the company determined the most supportable measurement dates for each of the various categories of options grants as follows discretionary grants 
discretionary grants included grants to the company s outside directors  the chief executive officer ceo  president and chief financial officer the three highest ranking executives of the company  other section officers  and all other company employees 
the company determined that it had granted stock options to its outside directors pursuant to the company s stock plans or board of directors minutes in the majority of instances  however  in a few instances  certain grants to these individuals require alternative measurement dates based on the approval dates specified in plan documents or signed minutes 
the company recorded a pre tax adjustment to compensation expense totaling less than million associated with all grants to outside directors during the relevant period 
during the relevant period  the company followed a practice of requiring compensation committee approval of the stock option awards to the three highest ranking executives of the company 
for some grants  the compensation committee minutes did not indicate approval of an award 
in other instances  the company either did not locate minutes or the evidence was inconclusive concerning when a specific meeting occurred 
the company determined that certain grants to these individuals require alternative measurement dates 
for example  due to inconclusive evidence regarding the date of compensation committee approval  because the board had approved the proxy statement in which the award was specifically listed  the proxy statement filing date was selected as the best evidence of a measurement date for the award 
the company recorded a pre tax adjustment to compensation expense totaling million for all grants to the three highest ranking executives of the company during the relevant period 
alternatively  for those grants where the proxy statement filing date was selected  had we used the highest or lowest closing price of our common stock between the grant date and the proxy statement filing date as the revised measurement date as a measurement date could have occurred on any date between those two dates  the pre tax adjustment to compensation expense would have been million higher using the highest price and million lower using the lowest price 
prior to may   the ceo approved stock option awards to section officers 
evidence of ceo approval typically consisted of an email containing the grant terms 
effective with the may  compensation committee meeting  the compensation committee was required to approve grants to the section officers 
evidence of compensation committee approval included compensation committee minutes or a signed unanimous written consent uwc 
the company determined that certain grants to these individuals require alternative measurement dates based on the date of approval identified in the supporting documentation 
the company recorded a pre tax adjustment to compensation expense totaling million in connection with discretionary grants to section officers  in addition to the million pre tax adjustment for grants to the three highest ranking executives of the company  during the relevant period 
throughout most of the relevant period  the company s option plans granted discretion to the ceo to award option grants to any company employee  other than the top three executives 
the ceo in turn authorized a defined number of options in connection with certain discretionary grants during the relevant period that were allocated by certain senior executives amongst employees within particular business units 
in certain instances  the review revealed that lists of grantees within specified business units had not been finalized as of the grant date 
where required  the company identified alternative measurement dates for these discretionary grants and recorded the required pre tax adjustment to compensation expense totaling million during the relevant period 
during the relevant period  the company also granted annual performance based options to employees at the discretion of certain executives and managers within each business unit 
based on the supporting documentation  the business units finalized the list of awards by person on different dates 
the company reconciled each list to the actual awards contained in the company s stock plan administration database to determine the date by which each business unit s list was finalized 
the company recorded a pre tax adjustment to compensation expense totaling million for six grant dates during the relevant period that primarily related to annual performance reviews 
anniversary grants 
throughout the relevant period  the company followed an informal policy of awarding options to individual employees in recognition of the anniversary of their employment with the company or in conjunction with employee promotions 
the number of these options was determined by the employee s level within the company  or  in the case of promotion grants  the level to which the employee was promoted 
the majority of these grants were modest in size  generally options or less 
in the case of senior management  anniversary or promotion grants could be much larger  at 
table of contents insight enterprises  inc 
 or  options 
occasionally  very senior executives  other than the top three executives  received larger grants for anniversaries or promotions  but these were relatively few and were generally done on a case by case basis 
the options subcommittee review indicated that the company s anniversary related options were granted with measurement dates determined by three general methods  depending upon the time period in the relevant period 
from the beginning of the relevant period through the end of  anniversary grants were generally granted with a measurement date on an employee s actual anniversary date 
for a period of time between and  the grant dates generally were selected retrospectively based on either the low price of a month or the low price of the quarter 
in the third quarter of  the company began a practice of awarding anniversary grants on the th day of each month for the balance of  and in january  the company essentially ceased making anniversary grants  except for minimal contractual grants to certain united kingdom employees which continued into the company used email correspondence or other documentation maintained in the stock plan administration files and information obtained from the company s human resources system and payroll records to determine each employee s anniversary date based on the employee s hire and corresponding anniversary date 
the general granting practice for anniversary awards in place at the relevant point in time was used to determine the appropriate measurement date for each employee s anniversary award 
for a limited number of grants  absent evidence of the employee s hire date  the date the employee record of the stock options was added to the company s stock plan administration database application was used as the measurement date for the awards identified as anniversary grants 
for periods where the company issued anniversary grants using quarterly or monthly lows  or other low prices  alternate measurement dates were required 
the company recorded a pre tax compensation expense adjustment totaling million for anniversary grants during the relevant period 
promotion grants 
promotion grants were generally handled in the same manner as anniversary grants 
in some instances  promotion grants were awarded on the promotion effective date and other times at the low price of the month or quarter 
the company s analysis revealed that the company had a general practice of granting promotion options on the employees promotion effective dates from through the company selected either the promotion effective date  if available  or the date the employee record of the stock options was added to the company s stock plan administration database application  if the promotion effective date was not available  as the measurement date for the promotion grants issued from through for subsequent periods where the company issued promotion grants using quarterly or monthly lows  or other low prices  alternate measurement dates were required 
the company recorded a pre tax compensation expense adjustment totaling million for promotion grants during the relevant period 
new hire grants 
throughout the relevant period  the company issued an option grant to each new employee on the employee s start date 
the company had a uniform practice of granting a specific number of options depending on the incoming employee s level within the company 
for example  the lowest level employees would receive options on their start date  while certain managers might receive  options 
senior executive officers would typically receive much larger grants upon joining the company  and those grants were typically negotiated as part of a total compensation package that were reflected in an employment agreement or offer letter 
in general  the company found a lack of significant issues with respect to new hire grants 
compensation expense was required to be recorded for administrative and error corrections and in a small number of cases where it was determined that an employee received an award with an effective date earlier than their actual start date  or where the amount of the grant was negotiated or otherwise selected after the employee began working at the company 
additionally  during certain limited periods  due to a limited number of options being available to grant  the company issued certain new hire grants at a later date along with the period s anniversary grants at the low price of the month or quarter  in which case the company determined that alternate measurement dates were required 
the company recorded a pre tax compensation expense adjustment totaling million for new hire grants during the relevant period 
program grants 
the company had numerous routine grant programs under which options were awarded to employees who participated on specific teams within the company  completed certain training programs or achieved certain goals in their jobs 
these options generally to options were typically only granted to individual employees below a certain level 
although these grants were routinely made on an annual or quarterly basis  no official written policies existed describing the exact criteria or timing for each grant program 
not all of the grants awarded pursuant to these programs could be identified due to incomplete or inconsistent documentation 
the company typically determined the most supportable measurement date based on communication of the list of recipients and the respective number of options to be granted to stock plan administration 
in those instances where the review failed to reveal a specific date when lists were received in stock plan administration  the company selected the date the employee record of the stock options was added to the company s stock plan administration database application as the measurement date 
the company recorded a pre tax adjustment to compensation expense totaling million for these program grants during the relevant period 

table of contents insight enterprises  inc 
for some grants  the company identified no supporting documentation to determine the timing of the approval of the terms of the grant 
in these instances  the company selected the date the employee record of the stock options was added to the company s stock plan administration database application as the measurement date 
related proceedings in october  we received a letter of informal inquiry from the sec requesting certain documents relating to our stock option grants and practices 
we have cooperated with the sec and will continue to do so 
we cannot predict the outcome of this investigation
