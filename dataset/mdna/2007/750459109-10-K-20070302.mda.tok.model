item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we have shifted more of our investments from predominantly perfect fit custom solutions to standards based solutions 
we believe standards based solutions provide our customers a number of fundamental benefits 
first  by using ready made platform solutions rather than ground start custom designs  our customers can achieve significantly shorter product intervals and faster time to market 
second  we believe our customers can achieve a lower total cost by using solutions that are leveraged across multiple applications rather than a single use proprietary solution 
by offering ready made solutions  we believe we have the opportunity to address a wider range of new market opportunities with the potential for faster time to revenue than with ground start  custom designs 
we believe this ability to reuse designs makes our business and investment model more scalable 
finally  we believe a more standards based product model will allow us to provide more 
table of contents integrated higher value solutions to our customers than we have typically delivered under a custom design model 
these higher value solutions drive higher price points and therefore more total revenue opportunities for our products 
in  we announced our plan for the promentum tm family of atca products 
the promentum tm family of products include turnkey platforms  universal carrier cards  switch and control modules  disk storage modules  compute modules  packet processing modules and various chassis models 
the promentum tm sys integrates these individual products into a blade server platform system 
we believe the promentum tm sys system will provide customers a highly reliable managed platform on which to build their new voice and data offerings 
the promentum tm atca is a packet processing module that allows the highest bandwidth available in a single atca slot 
this product features dual intel ixpxx network processors and is designed to address gbps wirespeed packet processing in network applications that demand high bandwidth throughput such as security gateways  ggsn s  broadband remote access servers  edge routers and session controllers 
we have significant experience in the design  delivery and deployment of carrier grade  modular platforms 
we believe the atca standard increases our opportunity to implement reusable platforms  enabling the deployment of more flexible solutions based on cost effective commercial technologies 
we believe our core atca solutions will be applicable across a wide range of customers and applications 
these integrated hardware and software platforms make extensive use of common system architectural and component designs  using carrier grade operating systems and middleware  and will reduce development time and costs  which enhances application portability 
in  we announced nine new products in our promentum family of atca solutions 
specifically  we announced our new promentum sys  the industry s first gigabit managed atca platform that will provide the highest traffic capacity throughput and processing densities available today 
our sys is targeted at data plane applications such as ims  radio network and base station controllers  media gateways  call servers  iptv among a number of applications 
as of december  our sys became generally available to our larger customer base 
we also introduced two new products based on the latest octeon processors from cavium networks 
the new atca and amc solutions provide high density gigabit ethernet interfaces with sophisticated dataplane hardware acceleration 
these products will help equipment manufacturers reduce r d costs while accelerating the introduction of high performance products such as radio network controllers  session border controllers  media gateways  edge routers and security gateways 
our new amc product provides power efficient packet and security processing for customers requiring amc modules for their atca and microtca platforms 
the atca is a high performance modular gigabit line card equipped with up to four cavium octeon plus processor amcs 
both products have been well received in the market and we expect to begin delivery of evaluation units in the second quarter of in addition to our new atca offerings  we announced our new procelerant tm series of modular computing solutions  for customers in our commercial systems market for medical  transaction terminals and test and measurement and other commercial applications 
these new modular products are now available  and we believe this family of high density  flexible solutions will enable commercial systems customers to achieve more rapid time to market with cost effective designs 
our new procelerant gm will be the industry s first com express product that supports low voltage mobile technology 
we believe it will provide our customers with greater processing power in a smaller footprint with lower power consumption 
we also announced the introduction of the high performance rms xi embedded server featuring two dual core intel xeon processors 
this new server will be used in many demanding data and graphics processing applications such as medical image processing and display  military  industrial machine vision  test and measurement  signal processing  and d and d image display 
finally we announced the procelerant rms  a u high performance embedded server with two dual core processors and the procelerant cegm dual core com express module 
both products are expected to ship in the first quarter of in the third quarter of we completed the acquisition of convedia and entered the media server market with a portfolio of media server products 
radisys media servers enable service innovation and differentiation by providing powerful  reusable and highly scalable multimedia processing platforms for voip and ims telecommunication service providers and enterprise customers 
together with our solution partners  
table of contents the media server family supports the next generation of feature rich  turnkey  high margin services that combine the best of the internet and telecommunications worlds 
the media server family consolidates the functions of traditional announcement servers  interactive voice response units  audio and video conference bridges  messaging platforms and speech platforms into a single  multi service  open standards compliant solution for network and enhanced services media processing 
our media servers share identical control interfaces  media processing features and management capabilities 
the many features and benefits of our media servers allow our customers to increase revenues through delivery of new and innovative services  while reducing capital and ongoing operational costs 
our cms and cms media servers have been successfully deployed around the world 
our newest media servers  the cms and cms  are optimized for ims network deployments and are currently in field trials with customers 
total revenue was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
backlog was approximately million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
backlog includes all purchase orders scheduled for delivery within months 
the general trend within our addressable markets is for shorter lead times and supplier managed inventory  which will generally decrease backlog over time as a percentage of revenue 
the increase in revenues during compared to was due to increases in revenues in the communications networking and commercial systems markets of million and million  respectively 
the increase in revenues during compared to was due to an increase in revenues in the communications networking market of million offset by a million decrease in revenues from the commercial systems market 
revenues in the communications networking market increased from to primarily due to strong demand within the wireless submarket as we continue to design and supply more content within our customers and g deployments 
for the fourth quarter of the increase in communication revenues was offset by reductions in requested deliveries from a large wireless customer 
we believe these reductions were driven by their efforts to significantly reduce inventory levels 
we expect our wireless market revenues to increase in the first quarter of revenues in the commercial systems market increased in the compared to  primarily due to increases in the medical submarket partially offset by declines in our transaction terminal and industrial automation submarkets  which is consistent with our strategies 
the increase in revenues from the medical market is attributable to design wins that have ramped into production during and the decrease in the transaction terminal revenues was primarily due to design wins nearing the end of their life cycle 
currently  our standards based products do not make up a significant percentage of our total revenues  however  we believe design wins associated with these products will begin to ramp into production in from a geographic perspective  from to the percentage of non us revenues by delivery destination increased as a percentage of total revenues 
this was primarily due to existing multinational customers requesting the delivery of products directly into the asia pacific region and increased revenues attributable to our emea region associated with our wireless infrastructure products 
for the year ended december  revenues from north america increased by million compared to the same periods in this increase is due to primarily to the addition of media server business revenues and increased nortel shipments in the fourth quarter of we expect our non us revenues to remain a significant portion of our revenues 
during the third quarter of  we announced our decision to disengage from one of our contract manufacturers in north america 
we are currently transitioning the majority of this production to our hillsboro facility 
this has resulted in a net increase in inventory related to the transition and we expect to see inventory levels start to decline after the first quarter of and continue to decline throughout the year to more traditional levels 
gross margins as a percentage of revenues were  and for  and  respectively 
approximately half of the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenues for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was attributable to product mix as more of our revenue is coming from higher volume products with competitive pricing 
the decrease is also due to 
table of contents million associated with purchase accounting charges attributed to the acquisition of convedia including thousand for fair value accounting for inventory and the amortization of the thousand of convedia backlog identified as an intangible asset  an increase of million associated with our excess and obsolete accrual and thousand associated with the write down of raw material inventory that was sold to our contract manufacturing partners during the first quarter of the decrease is also due to increased adverse purchase commitments associated with the transfer of our production from one of our contract manufacturers to our hillsboro facility and to our other contract manufacturer 
for the year ended december   cost of sales included thousand of stock based compensation expense which is discussed in note we also continued to incur redundant manufacturing costs as we moved forward with outsourcing our internal manufacturing to our contract manufacturing partners 
the decrease was also associated with additional manufacturing related costs in due to making our products rohs restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in the electrical and electronic equipment compliant 
we currently expect our gross margin percent to be higher in due to our current forecasted revenue mix 
net loss was million in net income was million in and million in net loss per share was for net income per share was and  basic and diluted  respectively  in net income per share was and  basic and diluted  respectively  in net income has decreased from to  due primarily to the purchase accounting charges due to the acquisition of convedia including a million in process research and development charge  million of intangible amortization and thousand of deferred compensation expenses 
see note acquisition of convedia 
from through  we initiated multiple restructurings of our operations 
these restructurings primarily included workforce reductions 
these workforce reductions were a result of the increase in outsourced manufacturing and a result of aligning our workforce to deliver more integrated advanced embedded platforms and solutions or standards based solutions 
in  we repurchased million principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes for million 
in  we repurchased million principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes for million 
in  we repurchased thousand principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes for thousand 
in  we began granting restricted stock to our employees 
as a result  in  we incurred thousand of stock based compensation expense associated with the vesting of restricted stock 
during  we incurred thousand of stock based compensation expense associated with shares to be issued pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan espp 
we incurred stock based compensation expense because the original number of espp shares approved by the shareholders was insufficient to meet employee demand for an espp offering which was consummated in february of and ended in august of we subsequently received shareholder approval for additional espp shares in may the stock based compensation expense associated with our equity instruments issued in and was calculated using the intrinsic value method 
as of january   we are required to account for stock based compensation based on the fair value method 
as a result  in  we incurred million of stock based compensation expense associated with options  restricted stock  and espp 
cash and cash equivalents and investments amounted to million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents and investments was primarily due to million in cash provided from operating activities used to purchase convedia 
we believe that cash flows from operations  available cash and investment balances  and short term borrowings will be sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs for the short term and long term 
in the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations  we intend to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements  changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year  and the primary factors that accounted for those changes  as well as how certain accounting principles  policies and estimates affect our financial statements 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that may affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  and revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
inventory reserves we record the inventory valuation allowance for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventories as the difference between the cost of inventories and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
factors influencing the provision include changes in demand  rapid technological changes  product life cycle and development plans  component cost trends  product pricing  regulatory requirements affecting components  and physical deterioration 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional provisions for inventory reserves may be required 
our estimate for the allowance is based on the assumption that our customers comply with their current contractual obligations 
we provide long life support to our customers and therefore we have material levels of customer specific inventory 
if our customers experience a financial hardship or if we experience unplanned cancellations of customer contracts  the current provision for the inventory reserves may be inadequate 
additionally  we may incur additional expenses associated with any non cancelable purchase obligations to our suppliers if they provide customer specific components 
adverse purchase commitments we are contractually obligated to reimburse our contract manufacturers for the cost of excess inventory used in the manufacture of our products  for which there is no alternative use 
excess inventory is defined as raw materials or assemblies components used in the manufacture of our products for which the contract manufacturers on hand and on order quantities are in excess of the requirements derived from our current product forecast of customer demand 
we are liable for excess inventory only to the extent that the contract manufacturer procures components to fulfill the manufacturing requirements as set forth in our current product forecast and agreed upon lead times and minimum order quantities 
unexpected decreases in customer demand or our inability to accurately forecast customer demand could result in increases in our adverse purchase commitment liability and have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
factors influencing the adverse purchase commitments liability include changes in demand  rapid technological changes  product life cycle and development plans  component cost trends  product pricing  customer liability and physical deterioration 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management we may incur additional expenses due to increases in our adverse purchase commitment liabilities 
our estimate for the adverse purchase commitments liabilities is based on the assumption that our customers comply with their current contractual obligations to us 
if our customers experience a financial hardship or if we experience unplanned cancellations of customer contracts  the current adverse purchase commitments liabilities may be inadequate estimates for adverse purchase commitments are derived from reports received on a quarterly basis from our contract manufacturers 
increases to this liability are charged to cost of goods sold 
when and if we take 
table of contents possession of inventory reserved for in this liability  the liability is transferred from other liabilities to our excess and obsolete inventory valuation allowance 
this liability  referred to as adverse purchase commitments  is provided for in other accrued liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets 
adverse purchase commitments amounted to million and thousand at december  and december   respectively 
accrued warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
our standard product warranty terms generally include post sales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period of time  which is generally months after shipment 
the workmanship of our products produced by contract manufacturers is covered under warranties provided by the contract manufacturer for a specified period of time ranging from to months 
we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers 
our estimated warranty obligation is based upon ongoing product failure rates  internal repair costs  contract manufacturing repair charges for repairs not covered by the contract manufacturer s warranty  average cost per call and current period product shipments 
if actual product failure rates  repair rates  service delivery costs  or post sales support costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
additionally  we accrue warranty costs for specific customer product repairs that are in excess of our warranty obligation calculation described above 
long lived assets our long lived assets include indefinite lived intangible assets or goodwill  definite lived intangible assets and property and equipment 
the net balance of goodwill  definite lived intangible assets and property and equipment at december  amounted to million  million and million  respectively 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over the assigned value of the net assets in connection with prior acquisitions 
goodwill will be written down or written off when impaired 
goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances conditions indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of september  and concluded that as of september   there was no goodwill impairment 
our annual goodwill impairment analysis consists of comparing our book value to our market capitalization 
if the trading price or the average trading price of our common stock is below the book value per share for a sustained period  a goodwill impairment test will be performed 
our book value per share was at september  compared to the closing price of radisys shares as quoted on the nasdaq global select market or the trading price on september  of 
management concluded there was no indication of material changes requiring an updated goodwill impairment analysis as of december  intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  primarily consist of acquired patents  completed technology  technology licenses  trade names and customer lists 
intangible assets are being amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from to years 
property and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  primarily consists of office equipment and software  manufacturing equipment  leasehold improvements  a building and other physical assets owned by radisys 
property and equipment are being depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from to years 
we assess impairment of intangible assets and property and equipment whenever conditions indicate that the carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable 
conditions that would trigger a long lived asset impairment assessment include  but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
if we determine that a long lived asset impairment assessment is required  we must determine the fair value of the asset  which is determined based on the associated net present value of estimated future cash flows 
we would estimate future cash flows using assumptions about our expected future operating performance 
our estimates of future cash flows may differ from actual cash flow due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions or changes to our business 
table of contents operations 
impairments would be recognized in operating results to the extent that the carrying value exceeds this calculated fair value of the long lived assets 
considerable management judgment is required in determining if and when a condition would trigger an impairment assessment of our long lived assets and once such a determination has been made  considerable management judgment is required to determine the fair market value of the long lived asset 
if the trading price or the average trading price of our common stock is below the book value per share for a sustained period or if and when a condition has triggered an impairment analysis of our long lived assets  we may incur substantial impairment losses due to the write down or the write off of our long lived assets 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of the assets and liabilities 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to more likely than not be realized in its future tax returns 
should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  adjustments to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets may be required 
the net deferred tax assets amounted to million as of december  as of december  we estimate utilization of the net deferred tax assets will require that we generate approximately million and million in taxable income in the us and canada  respectively  prior to the expiration of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards which will occur between as we have not yet filed our return and we have considered future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  we would increase the valuation allowance and make a corresponding charge to earnings in the period in which we make such determination 
likewise  if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the net deferred tax assets  we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance 
allowance for doubtful accounts we have a relatively small set of multinational customers that typically make up the majority of our accounts receivable balance 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is determined using a combination of factors to ensure that our trade receivables balances are not overstated 
we record reserves for individual accounts when we become aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position 
if circumstances related to customers change  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables would be further adjusted 
at december   of our accounts receivable was due from our four largest customers 
if one of these large customers or a number of our smaller customers files for bankruptcy or otherwise is unable to pay the amounts due to us the current allowance for doubtful accounts may not be adequate 
during the years ended december  and there were no significant account balances reserved for and the allowance for doubtful accounts decreased by thousand as a result of the write off of previously specifically identified account balances 
we maintain a non specific bad debt reserve for all customers based on a variety of factors  including the length of time receivables are past due  trends in overall weighted average risk rating of the total portfolio  macroeconomic conditions  significant one time events and historical experience 
typically  this non specific bad debt reserve amounts to approximately of quarterly revenues 
accrued restructuring and other charges for the years ended december   and expenses associated with exit or disposal activities are recognized when probable and estimable 
because we have a history of paying severance 
table of contents benefits  the cost of severance benefits associated with a restructuring charge is recorded when such costs are probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
for leased facilities that were vacated and subleased  an amount equal to the total future lease obligations from the date of vacating the premises through the expiration of the lease  net of any future sublease income  was recorded as a part of restructuring charges 
we have engaged  and may continue to engage  in restructuring actions  which require us to make significant estimates in several areas including realizable values of assets made redundant or obsolete  expenses for severance and other employee separation costs  the ability to generate sublease income  as well as our ability to terminate lease obligations at the amounts we have estimated  and other exit costs 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted 
for a description of our restructuring actions  refer to our discussion of restructuring charges in the results of operations section 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete  as evidenced by the following revenue recognition criteria an agreement with the customer  fixed pricing  transfer of title and risk of loss and customer acceptance  if applicable  and that the collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements  such as hardware and software products  licenses and or services  we allocate revenue to each element based on its relative fair value  or for software  based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value 
in the absence of fair value for a delivered element  we first allocate revenue to the fair value of the undelivered elements and the residual revenue to the delivered elements 
where the fair value for an undelivered element cannot be determined  we defer revenue for the delivered elements until the undelivered elements are delivered 
we limit the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services or subject to customer specified return or refund privileges 
we enter into contracts to sell our products and services  and  while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions under which we recognize revenue upon shipment of product  infrequently we enter into agreements that contain non standard terms and conditions 
non standard terms and conditions can include  but are not limited to  customer acceptance criteria or other post delivery obligations 
as a result  significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate timing of revenue recognition 
the components of total revenues were as follows in thousands for the years ended december  hardware software royalties and licenses software maintenance engineering and other services other total revenues hardware under our standard terms and conditions of sale  we transfer title and risk of loss to the customer at the time product is shipped to the customer and revenue is recognized accordingly  unless customer acceptance is uncertain or significant obligations remain 
we reduce revenue for estimated customer returns for rotation rights according to agreements with our distributors 
the amount of revenues derived from these distributors as a percentage of total revenues was for the year ended december  and for the years ended december  and 
table of contents software royalties and licenses revenue from customers for prepaid  non refundable software royalties is recorded when the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
revenue for non prepaid royalties is recognized at the time the underlying product is shipped by the customer paying the royalty 
we recognize software license revenue at the time of shipment or upon delivery of the software master provided when the revenue recognition criteria have been met and vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate the total fee to all delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement 
software maintenance software maintenance services are recognized as earned on the straight line basis over the terms of the contracts 
engineering and other services engineering services revenue is recognized upon completion of certain contractual milestones and customer acceptance of the services rendered 
other services revenues include hardware repair services and custom software implementation projects 
hardware repair services revenues are recognized when the services are complete 
software implementation revenues are recognized upon completion of certain contractual milestones and customer acceptance of the services rendered 
stock based compensation equity instruments are granted to employees  directors and consultants in certain instances  as defined in the respective plan agreements 
in  we issued equity instruments in the form of stock options  restricted stock  and stock issued to employees as a result of the espp 
in  we issued equity instruments in the form of stock options  restricted shares and stock issued to employees as a result of espp 
in we issued equity instruments in the form of stock options and stock issued to employees as a result of the espp  only 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method  and therefore have not restated prior periods results 
under this method we recognize compensation expense for all stock based employee benefit plan equity awards granted after january  and prior to but not yet vested as of january   in accordance with sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  we recognize stock based compensation on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award for those shares expected to vest as described below 
prior to sfas r adoption  we accounted for share based payments under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
we continue to use the black scholes model to measure the grant date fair value of stock options and espp shares 
the grant date fair value of stock options that are expected to vest is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is equal to the option vesting period which is generally years 
the grant date fair value of espp shares that are expected to vest is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally months  subject to modification at the date of purchase due to the espp look back feature 
the grant date fair value of restricted stock is equal to the closing price of radisys shares as quoted on the nasdaq global select market on the date of grant 
the grant date fair value of restricted stock that are expected to vest is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is years 
the estimate of the number of options  espp shares and restricted stock expected to vest is determined based on historical experience 
to determine the fair value of the stock options and espp shares  using the black scholes option pricing model  the calculation takes into consideration the effect of the following exercise price of the option or purchase price of the espp share  price of our common stock on the date of grant  expected term of the option or share  
table of contents expected volatility of our common stock over the expected term of the option or share  and risk free interest rate during the expected term of the option or share 
the calculation includes several assumptions that require management s judgment 
the expected term of the option or share is determined based on assumptions about patterns of employee exercises and represents a probability weighted average time period from grant until exercise of stock options  subject to information available at time of grant 
determining expected volatility generally begins with calculating historical volatility for a similar long term period and then considers the ways in which the future is reasonably expected to differ from the past 
as part of our sfas r adoption  we also examined our historical pattern of option exercises in an effort to determine if there were any discernable activity patterns based on certain employee populations 
from this analysis  we identified three employee populations 
the expected term computation is based on historical vested option exercises and post vest forfeiture patterns and includes an estimate of the expected term for options that were fully vested and outstanding at december  for each of the three populations identified 
the estimate of the expected term for options that were fully vested and outstanding at december  was determined as the midpoint of a range of estimated expected terms determined as follows the low end of the range assumes the fully vested and outstanding options settle on december  and the high end of the range assumes that these options expire upon contractual term 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury constant maturities in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option or share 
determining the appropriate fair value model and  as noted above  calculating the fair value of equity instruments associated with our employee benefit plans require the input of highly subjective assumptions 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of these equity instruments represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on stock based compensation 
as a result of adopting sfas r  loss before income taxes for the year ended december  was million higher and net loss for the year ended december  was million higher than if we had continued to account for stock based compensation under apb the impact on both basic and diluted loss per share for the year ended december  was

revenues increased by million  or  from million in to million in the increase in revenue during compared to was due to increases in revenues in the communications networking and commercial systems markets of million and million  respectively 
revenues in the communications networking market increased in compared to due to strong demand within the wireless market as our product content continues to expand with and g deployments 
revenues were also higher due to deployments of new products by one of our major customers as well as the addition of media server business revenues 
for the fourth quarter of the increase in communication revenues was offset by reductions in requested deliveries from a large wireless customer 
we believe these reductions were driven by their efforts to significantly reduce inventory levels 
we expect our wireless market revenues to increase in the first quarter of as this customer returns to more traditional volumes 
revenues in the commercial systems market increased in the compared to  primarily due to increases within the medical submarket partially offset by declines in our transaction terminal and industrial automation submarkets 
the increase in revenues from the medical market was attributable to design wins that have ramped into production during and the decrease in revenues attributable to the transaction terminal market was primarily due to design wins nearing the end of their life cycle 
given the dynamics of these markets  we may experience general fluctuations in the percentage of revenue attributable to each market and  as a result  the quarter to quarter and year to year comparisons of our markets often are not indicative of overall economic trends affecting the long term performance of our markets 
we currently expect that each of our markets will continue to represent a significant portion of total revenues 
we currently expect revenue to grow modestly over currently  our standards based products do not make up a significant percentage of our total revenues  however  we believe design wins 
table of contents associated with these products will begin to ramp into production in based on the timing of our customers next generation system deployments 
from a geographic perspective  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the percentage of non us revenues by delivery destination increased as a percentage of total revenues 
revenues as measured by destination in the emea region increased by million while asia pacific revenues increased by million 
this was primarily due to existing multinational customers requesting the delivery of products directly into the asia pacific region and increased revenues attributable to our emea region associated with our wireless infrastructure products 
for the year ended december  revenues from north america increased by million compared to the same periods in this increase is due to primarily to the addition of media server business revenues and increased nortel shipments in the fourth quarter of we currently expect continued fluctuations in the percentage of revenue from each geographic region 
additionally  we expect non us revenues to remain a significant portion of our revenues 
gross margin 
gross margin as a percentage of revenues for was compared to for approximately half of the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenues for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was attributable to product mix  as more of our current revenue is coming from higher volume products with competitive pricing 
the decrease is also due to million associated with purchase accounting charges attributed to the acquisition of convedia  including thousand for fair valuing accounting of inventory and the amortization of the thousand of convedia backlog identified as an intangible asset  an increase of million associated with our excess and obsolete accrual and thousand associated with the write down of raw material inventory that was sold to our contract manufacturing partners during the first quarter of the decrease is also due to increased adverse purchase commitments associated with the transfer of our production from one of our contract manufacturers to our hillsboro facility and to our other contract manufacturer 
for the year ended december   cost of sales included thousand of stock based compensation expense which is discussed in note we also continued to incur redundant manufacturing costs as we moved forward with outsourcing our internal manufacturing to our contract manufacturing partners 
the decrease was also associated with additional manufacturing related costs in due to making our products rohs compliant 
we currently expect our gross margin percent to be higher in due to our current forecasted revenue mix 
research and development

stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  consists of amortization of stock based compensation associated with stock options and espp shares 
table of contents unvested and outstanding on january   new stock options and espp shares granted for the year ended december  and unvested restricted stock 
during the year ended december   the company incurred million in stock based compensation 
during the year ended december   we incurred thousand in stock based compensation expense 
we anticipate that stock based compensation will increase by million to approximately million in due primarily due to the acceleration of employee stock options with an option price greater than 
as a result of the acceleration  we reduced the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized in  however  in stock based compensation expense will increase as the benefit from the acceleration will have been fully utilized as we recognize three years of stock grants as opposed to the two years we recognized in the increase is also due to the acquisition of convedia 
we recognized stock based compensation expense as follows in thousands cost of sales research and development selling  general  and administrative deferred compensation expense 
on september  all outstanding convedia stock options vested and were considered exercised immediately 
the proceeds of which were distributed as follows of the purchase price per share less the exercise price was paid to the option holder at closing and the remaining will be paid in full to those convedia employees still employed by radisys after one year of service 
the paid at the time of the acquisition is included in the purchase price and is allocated to goodwill 
the remaining is recorded as deferred compensation and amortized through the statement of operations for the life of the asset one year 
pursuant to the purchase agreement any forfeitures are reallocated to the remaining convedia employees

we recognized deferred compensation expense as follows in thousands cost of sales research and development selling  general  and administrative intangible assets amortization 
intangible assets consist of purchased technology  patents and other identifiable intangible assets 
intangible assets amortization expense was million and million in and  respectively 
intangible assets amortization increased primarily due to intangible assets acquired with the purchase of convedia partially offset by certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized during and early we perform reviews for impairment of the purchased intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
restructuring and other charges 
we evaluate the adequacy of the accrued restructuring and other charges on a quarterly basis 
as a result  we record certain reclassifications and reversals to the accrued restructuring and other charges based on the results of the evaluation 
the total accrued restructuring and other charges for each restructuring event are not affected by reclassifications 
reversals are recorded in the period in which we determine that expected restructuring and other obligations are less than the amounts accrued 
tables summarizing the activity in the accrued liability for each restructuring event are contained in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
during and  we recorded restructuring and other charges and reversals as described below 

table of contents fourth quarter restructuring during the fourth quarter of  we initiated a restructuring plan that included the elimination of positions primarily supporting our contract manufacturing operations as a result of the termination of our relationship with one of our contract manufacturers in north america 
the restructuring plan also includes closing our charlotte office 
in  we incurred severance and other employee related separation costs of thousand as a result of this restructuring event 
we expect this workforce reduction and office closure to be completed by september  second quarter restructuring in june  we initiated a restructuring plan that included the elimination of positions primarily within our manufacturing operations as a result of the continued outsourcing of production to our manufacturing partners 
in  we incurred severance and other employee related separation costs of thousand as well as thousand of restructuring reversals 
during the second quarter of  we announced that we were discontinuing our relationship with one of our contract manufacturers in north america 
as a result  we determined that all future employment terminations that were originally included in the second quarter restructuring event would not occur in the near term and the associated liability was reversed 
fourth quarter restructuring the accrual amount remaining as of december  represents lease obligations relating to the facilities in boca raton  florida which were paid in january loss on the repurchase of convertible notes 
in  we repurchased thousand principal amount of the outstanding convertible subordinated notes due august  for thousand and  as a result  recorded a loss of thousand 
in  we repurchased million principal amount of the outstanding convertible subordinated notes  with an associated discount of thousand 
we repurchased the notes in the open market for million and  as a result  recorded a loss of thousand 
interest expense 
interest expense includes interest expense incurred on the convertible senior and the convertible subordinated notes 
interest expense decreased thousand  or  from million in to million in the decrease in the interest expense for compared to is due to the decrease in interest expense associated with the convertible subordinated notes primarily resulting from the repurchases of the convertible subordinated notes in the fourth quarter of interest income 
interest income increased million  or  from million in to million in interest income increased as a result of a higher average balance of cash  cash equivalents and investments in compared to increasing interest rates and a shift in our investment portfolio towards higher yielding auction rate securities has also contributed to the increase in interest income 
however we expect interest income to decrease due to our decreased cash and cash equivalents and investments balance associated with the purchase of convedia 
other income expense  net 
other expense  net  primarily includes foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
other income expense  net  was thousand in compared to thousand in foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a net gain of thousand in compared to a net loss of thousand in the change in the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is relatively flat for the year due to small changes in the japanese yen  euro and gbp relative the us dollar 
income tax provision 
we recorded a tax benefit of thousand for the year ended december  compared to a tax provision of million for the year ended december  our effective tax rate for the year ended was compared to for the year ended december  the company s current effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the impact of stock option expense  in process r d related to the convedia acquisition  research and development tax credits generated in and taxes on foreign income that differ from us tax rate 

table of contents on december  president bush signed the tax relief and health care act of the tax relief act which extended the research and development tax credit 
under the tax relief act the research and development tax credit was retroactively reinstated to january  and is available through december  we have recorded a federal research and development credit of approximately thousand for the year ended at december   we had net deferred tax assets of million 
valuation allowances of million and million  as of december  and  respectively  have been provided for deferred income tax assets related primarily to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that may not be realized 
the increase in valuation allowance of million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to a projected decrease in future utilization of general business tax credits carryforwards 
over the last three years we have generated cumulative book income 
as of december  we estimate utilization of the net deferred tax assets will require that we generate million and million in taxable income in the us and canada  respectively  prior to the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards which will occur between and we cannot provide absolute assurance that we will generate sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the net deferred tax assets  and accordingly  we may record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets if our expectations of future taxable income change or are not achieved 
we have considered future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  we would increase the valuation allowance and make a corresponding charge to earnings in the period in which we make such determination 
likewise  if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the net deferred tax assets  we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance 
finally  any tax benefit subsequently recognized from the acquired net operating loss and research and development tax credit associated with our microware acquisition  completed in  would be allocated to goodwill and will not benefit the income statement 
the company is subject to income taxes in the us and nine foreign countries  and on occasion  we have been subject to corporate income tax audits 
in determining the value of income tax liabilities we make estimates of the results of future examinations of our income tax returns by taxing authorities 
we believe that we have adequately provided our financial statements for additional taxes that we estimate may result from these examinations 
if these amounts provided prove to be more than what is necessary  the reversal of the reserves would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period in which we determine the liability is no longer necessary 
if an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities  an additional charge to expense will result 
comparison of year and year revenues 
revenues increased by million  or  from million in to million in the increase in revenue during compared to was due to an increase in revenues in the communications networking market of million offset by a million decrease in revenues from the commercial systems market 
revenues in the communications networking market increased in compared to due to strong demand within the wireless market as our product content continues to expand with and g deployments 
revenues were also higher due to deployments of new products by one of our major customers 
revenues in the commercial systems market decreased in the compared to  primarily due to declines in our transaction terminal and industrial automation business  partially offset by increases within our medical and test and measurement market 
the decrease in revenues attributable to the transaction terminal market was primarily due to design wins nearing the end of their life cycle 
the increase in revenues from the medical market was attributable to design wins that ramped into production during given the dynamics of these markets  we may experience general fluctuations in the percentage of revenue attributable to each market and  as a result  the quarter to quarter and year to year comparisons of our 
table of contents markets often are not indicative of overall economic trends affecting the long term performance of our markets 
we currently expect that each of our markets will continue to represent a significant portion of total revenues 
from a geographic perspective  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the overall increase in revenues was split between customers located in the emea and asia pacific regions 
for the year ended december  compared to the same period in revenues as measured by destination in the emea region increased by million while asia pacific revenues increased by million 
this increase related to the asia pacific region due to shipments of products to existing multinational customers receiving products directly into the asia pacific region 
for the year ended december  revenues from north america declined by million compared to the same period in the decline in this region was a result of declines in our transaction terminal and industrial automation business as well as a shift of sales for our multinational customers requesting delivery of products directly into the asia pacific region 
we currently expect continued fluctuations in the percentage of revenue from each geographic region 
additionally  we expect non us revenues to remain a significant portion of our revenues 
gross margin 
gross margin as a percentage of revenues for was compared to for approximately half of the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenues for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was attributable to product mix as more of our revenue came from higher volume products with volume based pricing 
the remainder of the decrease was associated with our write down of inventory valuation for excess and obsolete e o inventory  an increase in the adverse purchase commitment liabilities associated with our outsourced manufacturing operations and higher silicon prices due to industry shortages 
we also continued to incur some redundant manufacturing costs as we moved forward with outsourcing our internal manufacturing to our partners 
finally  we incurred additional manufacturing related costs in due to making our products rohs compliant and incurring additional warranty related costs 
research and development 
r d expenses consist primarily of salary  bonuses and benefits for product development staff  and cost of design and development supplies and equipment  net of reimbursements for non recurring engineering services 
r d expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in our investment in the development of standards based products  such as atca  increased our r d expense for compared during  we also continued to increase headcount at our shanghai development center and added other expenses in connection with the development of the infrastructure to support this location 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in variable compensation linked to profitability

sg a expenses decreased thousand  or  from million in to million in the decrease in sg a expense for the year ended december  was primarily associated with thousand in non recurring costs that were recognized in the associated with a potential acquisition that was ultimately abandoned 
without these costs we would have seen an increase in sg a expense of thousand in primarily due to annual merit increases in salaries 
stock based compensation expense 
in  thousand shares of restricted stock were granted 
we incurred thousand of stock based compensation related to restricted stock for the year ended december  we did not incur any stock based compensation expense associated with restricted stock for the year ended december  in  we incurred thousand of stock based compensation expense associated with shares issued pursuant to the espp 
we incurred stock based compensation expense because the original number of espp shares approved by the shareholders was insufficient to meet employee demand for an espp offering which was consummated in february and ended in august we subsequently received shareholder 
table of contents approval for additional espp shares in may the shares issued in the february espp offering in excess of the original number of espp shares approved at the beginning of the offering the shortfall triggered recognition of stock based compensation expense under the intrinsic value method 
the shortfall amounted to thousand and thousand shares in may and august  respectively 
the expense per share was calculated as the difference between of the closing price of radisys shares as quoted on the nasdaq global select market on the date that additional espp shares were approved may and the february espp offering purchase price 
accordingly  the expense per share was calculated as the difference between and 
the shortfall of shares was dependent on the amount of contributions from participants enrolled in the february espp offering we recognized stock based compensation expense in reported net income related to restricted stock grants and the espp shortfall as follows in thousands for the years ended december  cost of sales research and development selling  general and administrative intangible assets amortization 
intangible assets consist of purchased technology  patents and other identifiable intangible assets 
intangible assets amortization expense was million and million in and  respectively

the total accrued restructuring and other charges for each restructuring event are not affected by reclassifications 
reversals are recorded in the period in which we determine that expected restructuring and other obligations are less than the amounts accrued 
tables summarizing the activity in the accrued liability for each restructuring event are contained in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

the reversals were primarily associated with employees who left radisys prior to receiving a severance payment and employees 
table of contents who were retained to fill new positions at radisys 
in  we recorded reversals amounting to million relating primarily to a buy out of the remaining lease obligations on the houston facility vacated as a result of previous restructuring events and various amounts originally accrued for certain non cancelable leases for facilities vacated as a result of previous restructuring events 
we entered into subleasing arrangements for a portion of these facilities and as a result we reduced the restructuring accruals

other expense  net  primarily includes foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
other expense  net  was thousand in compared to thousand in foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a net loss of thousand in compared to a net loss of thousand in the net exchange rate loss incurred for the year ended december  was primarily caused by the strengthening of the us dollar relative to the japanese yen throughout income tax provision 
we recorded a tax provision of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  our effective tax rate for the year ended was compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in the tax provision as well as the effective tax rate in versus was primarily due to a projected increase in future utilization of deferred tax assets causing the reversal of a portion of the related valuation allowance and taxes on foreign income that differs from us tax rate 
on october   the president of the united states of america signed the american jobs creation act the jobs act 
one of the key provisions of the jobs act includes a repeal of the extraterritorial income exclusion 
in its place  the jobs act provides a relief provision for domestic manufacturers by providing a new domestic manufacturing deduction 
the jobs act also includes a temporary incentive for us multinationals to repatriate foreign earnings and other international tax reforms designed to improve the global competitiveness of us multinationals 
in we completed our evaluation of the impact of the jobs act and have concluded not to repatriate any foreign earnings pursuant to the provisions of the jobs act and have determined that due to the reduction of our domestic manufacturing operations  the impact of domestic manufacturing deduction was minimal 
on october  the working families tax relief act of was enacted to extend several tax credits  including the research and development tax credit 
under the new law the research and development tax credit was retroactively reinstated to june  and is available through december  we have recorded a federal research and development credit of approximately thousand for the year ended at december   we had net deferred tax assets of million 
valuation allowances of million and million  as of december  and  respectively  have been provided for deferred income tax assets related primarily to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that may not be 
table of contents realized 
the decrease in valuation allowance of million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily attributable to a projected increase in future utilization of general business tax credits and certain net operating loss carryforwards 
over the last three years we have generated significant cumulative book income 
as of december  we estimated utilization of the net deferred tax assets would require that we generate million in taxable income prior to the expiration of net operating loss carryforwards which will occur between and we cannot provide absolute assurance that we will generate sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the net deferred tax assets  and accordingly  we may record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets if our expectations of future taxable income change or are not achieved 
if we were to record a valuation allowance  the allowance could include the entire balance of net deferred tax assets as any significant departures from expected future taxable income could suggest uncertainty in our business and therefore we may determine that there is no reasonable basis to calculate a partial valuation allowance 
any tax benefit subsequently recognized from the acquired net operating loss and research and development tax credit associated with our microware acquisition  completed in  would be allocated to goodwill and will not benefit the income statement

this has resulted in a net increase in inventory related to this transition and we expect to see inventory levels start to decline after the first quarter of and continue to decline throughout the year to more traditional levels 
also  due to the inherent risks associated with this transfer of production we may incur additional expenses related to adverse purchase commitments or excess and obsolete inventory

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and equity trading prices  which could affect our financial position and results of operations 
interest rate risk 
we invest excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and those of high quality corporate issuers 
we attempt to protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market  and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates decline 
due to the short duration of most of the investment portfolio  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
additionally  
table of contents the interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not necessarily have a direct impact on our earnings or cash flows 
therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected  to any significant degree  by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on the securities portfolio 
the estimated fair value of our debt securities that we have invested in at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the effect of an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows 
foreign currency risk 
we pay the expenses of our international operations in local currencies  namely  the euro  british pound sterling  new shekel  japanese yen  chinese renminbi and canadian dollar 
the international operations are subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  foreign exchange rate volatility and other regulations and restrictions 
accordingly  future results could be materially and adversely affected by changes in these or other factors 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the balance sheets and income statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars during the consolidation process 
because exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely affect overall expected profitability 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a net gain of thousand for the year ended december   and a net loss of thousand and thousand for the years ended december   and  respectively
