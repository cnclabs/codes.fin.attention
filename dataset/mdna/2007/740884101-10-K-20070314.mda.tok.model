while some actually went bankrupt  many others lost their investment grade debt ratings with resulting market declines 
the insurance company s investment portfolio realized losses from sales and from recognition of other than temporary impairment charges  with the result that net losses were encountered in a corollary impact of these was that capital ratios were adversely affected in that year 
in and  recoveries in the market values were experienced  which resulted in the corporation achieving record high levels of capital and improved capital ratios 
in and  the company rebalanced a portion of its fixed income portfolio see  item  management s discussion and analysis  liquidity and capital resources  asset liability management 
the portfolio rebalancing resulted in a decreased yield on investments  as longer term assets were sold with the proceeds being reinvested in shorter term assets with a lower yield 
the sale of the long term investments also resulted in approximately million of realized capital gains in in  the lower yields from portfolio rebalancing contributed to decreased income from investments 
this  along with a loss on the payor swaptions  reflected in realized capital gains and decreased investment income from the partnerships resulted in lower revenues and a lower investment return on assets in as described under ratings and regulation  the corporation s business is substantially affected by capital ratios and their impact on its ratings 
consequently  the insurance company s management established a policy of reducing the level of sales increases until capital and surplus ratios are further improved 
sales are also being made with a greater selectivity based on increased profit level requirements for new business 
the insurance company has determined that the level of competition in the sale of traditional and universal life insurance products has made it very difficult for smaller insurance companies  such as the insurance company  to participate in this business in a profitable way 
accordingly  the insurance company has determined that  under the current market conditions  it will not participate in the sale of traditional and universal life policies 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the insurance company is engaged in the sale of insurance products with three primary lines of business individual annuities  individual life insurance  and group accident and health 
revenues are derived primarily from premiums received from the sale of annuity contracts  life and accident and health products  and gains or losses  from our investment portfolio 
as described in item a  since the insurance company has suspended the sale of traditional and universal life insurance due to existing market conditions 
for financial statement purposes  our revenues from the sale of whole life and term life insurance products and annuity contracts with life contingencies are treated differently from our revenues from the sale of annuity contracts without life contingencies  deferred annuities and universal life insurance products 
premiums from the sale of whole or term life insurance products and life contingent annuities are reported as premium income on our financial statements 
premiums from the sale of deferred annuities  universal life insurance products and annuities without life contingencies are not reported as premium revenues  but rather are reported as additions to policyholders account balances 
for these products  revenues are recognized over time in the form of policy fee income  surrender charges and mortality and other charges deducted from policyholders account balances 
profitability in the insurance company s individual annuities  individual life insurance and group accident and health depends largely on the size of its inforce block  the adequacy of product pricing and underwriting discipline  and the efficiency of its claim and expense management 
unless specifically stated otherwise  all references to  and refer to our fiscal years ended  or the dates  as the context requires  december   december  and december   respectively 
when we use the term we  us and our we mean the corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries 
in this discussion  we have included statements that may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements are not historical facts but instead represent only our beliefs regarding future events  many of which  by their nature  are inherently uncertain and beyond our control 
these statements may relate to our future plans and objectives 
by identifying these statements for you in this manner  we are alerting you to the possibility that our actual results may differ  possibly materially  from results indicated in these forward looking statements 
important factors  among others  that could cause our results to differ from those indicated in the forward looking statements are discussed below and under certain factors that may affect our business 
executive overview results the corporation s earnings per share were for  as compared to in and in results in reflect decreases in both investment income and net realized investment gains from the prior years 
our total revenues in were million  compared to million in and million in the corporation s decreases in earning and revenues in resulted primarily from decreases in net investment income and realized capital gains 
in  the lower yields from the portfolio rebalancing see  item  management s discussion and analysis  liquidity and capital resources  asset liability management  a loss on the payor swaptions reflected in the realized capital gains  and decreased investment income from the corporation s partnership investments all contributed to lower revenues in certain factors that may affect our business there are numerous factors  some of which are outside our control  which could have a material impact on our business 
these factors include market conditions  legal and regulatory changes and operational risk 
a summary of these factors is set below market conditions the corporation  like all companies  is affected by the general state of financial markets and economic conditions in the us and elsewhere 
despite certain recent improvements in business conditions  the business environment in recent years has been difficult and the ability to obtain desired returns on the investment portfolio without exposing the corporation to excess risk has been challenging 
this  in turn  has had an impact on our willingness to expand sales of our single premium annuity products 
legal and regulatory risk as an insurance company  we are subject to substantial regulatory control 
any material change in the framework in which we operate could have a material impact on the business 
for further discussion on how we deal with the regulatory requirements  see business insurance regulation 
operational risk business is dependent on our ability to process  on a daily basis  our payment obligations under outstanding policies and the condition of the investment portfolio 
any internal failures in the internal processes  people  or systems could lead to adverse consequences to the corporation 
in addition  despite the contingency plans in place  the ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by the disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business and the community in which we are located 
interest rate risk the insurance company s principal products are deferred annuities  which are interest rate sensitive instruments 
in an interest rate environment of falling or stable rates the insurance company s annuity holders are less likely to seek to surrender their annuities prior to maturity to seek alternative  higher yielding investments 
however  in an environment of moderately or significantly increasing rates  such surrenders should be expected to increase 
as of december   the existence of surrender fees on approximately of the insurance company s outstanding deferred annuities acts as a deterrent against surrenders 
however  if interest rates climb sufficiently  such fees may not have a significant deterrent effect 
moreover  the surrender fees are only in effect for up to the first years of each annuity policy and  therefore  disappear over time see table be low 
in the event of a substantial increase in surrenders during a short period of time  the insurance company may have to sell off longer term assets to pay current surrender liabilities 
the insurance company continually develops strategies to address the match between the timing of its assets and liabilities 
to that end  during and  especially in light of the substantial number of policies coming off surrender charges in those years and in  the insurance company reduced the amount of assets invested in longer term investments by approximately  million and reinvested in short and intermediate return investments at reduced yields 
these reduced yields were partially offset by the gains recognized by the insurance company from the sale of the longer term assets 
to protect against a substantial sudden increase in rates basis points  the company has entered into a series of payor swaption investments 
under these investments  the company obtaine d the right to enter into interest rate swap agreements with counterparties under which the company s interest rate obligations are fixed and the counterparties obligations are variable  thus protecting the company from sudden rate increases 
see  item  management s discussion and analysis  liquidity and capital resources  asset liability management 
account value with surrender charges expiring year expiring account value in millions percent of account value expiring and later total pricing management believes that the insurance company is able to offer its products at competitive prices to its targeted markets as a result of i maintaining relatively low issuance costs by selling through the independent general agency system  ii minimizing home office administrative costs  and iii utilizing appropriate underwriting guidelines 
the long term profitability of sales of life and most annuity products depends on the degree of margin of the actuarial assumptions that underlie the pricing of such products 
actuarial calculations for such products  and the ultimate profitability of sales of such products  are based on four major factors i persistency  ii rate of return on cash invested during the life of the policy or contract  iii expenses of acquiring and administering the policy or contract  and iv mortality 
persistency is the rate at which insurance policies remain in force  expressed as a percentage of the number of policies remaining in force over the previous year 
policyholders can either surrender policies or cause their policies to lapse by failing to pay premiums 
ratio of annualized voluntary terminations surrenders and lapses to mean life insurance in force the assumed rate of return on invested cash and desired spreads during the period that insurance policies or annuity contracts are in force also affects pricing of products and currently includes an assumption by the insurance company of a specified rate of return and or spread on its investments for each year that such insurance or annuity product is in force 
investment results the following table summarizes the insurance company s investment results for the periods indicated  as determined in accordance with gaap 
year ended december  in thousands cash and total invested assets net investment income effective yield net realized investment gains losses average of cash and aggregate invested amounts at the beginning and end of period 
net investment income is net of investment expenses and excludes capital gains and losses and provision for income taxes 
net investment income divided by average cash and total invested assets including accrued investment income minus net investment income 
net realized investment gains losses include provisions for impairment in value that are considered other than temporary and exclude provisions for income taxes 
the reduction in the net investment income ratios from to was attributable to the low interest rate environment and overall economic conditions  which led to defaults or write downs within the company s investment portfolio 
a general improvement in market conditions and an increase in net investment income were the primary factors in the to increase  while the rebalancing of the portfolio into lower yield  short term investments and the need for cash to fund annuity surrenders  caused a decrease in the net investment income ratio in and see  item  management s discussion and analysis  liquidity and capital resources  asset liability management 
the sale of long term investments to support the portfolio rebalancing also resulted in approximately million of realized capital gains in in  a loss of million on the payor swaptions reflec ted in the realized capital gains losses  and the absence of the capital gains from portfolio rebalancing realized in  resulted in a difference between a net realized investment gain of million in and a net realized investment loss of million in another major factor affecting profitability is the level of expenses 
management believes that one of the insurance company s strengths is its concentration on minimizing expenses through periodic review and adjustment of general and administrative costs 
investments the insurance company derives a predominant portion of its total revenues from investment income 
the insurance company manages most of its investments internally 
all investments made on behalf of the insurance company are governed by the statement of investment policy established and approved by the investment committee  the finance committee and the board of directors of the insurance company and the corporation and by qualitative and quantitative limits prescribed by applicable insurance laws and regulations 
the investment committee meets regularly to set and review investment policy and to approve current investment plans 
the actions of the investment committee are subject to review and approval by the finance committee and the board of directors of the insurance company and corporation 
the insurance company s statement of investment policy must comply with nysid regulations and the regulations of other applicable regulatory bodies 
the insurance company s investment philosophy generally focuses on purchasing investment grade securities with the intention of holding such securities to maturity 
however  as market opportunities liquidity  or regulatory considerations may dictate  securities may be sold prior to maturity 
the insurance company has categorized all fixed maturity securities as available for sale and carries such investments at market value 
the insurance company manages its investment portfolio to meet the diversification  yield and liquidity requirements of its insurance policy and annuity contract obligations 
the insurance company s liquidity requirements are monitored regularly so that cash flow needs are satisfied 
adjustments periodically are made to the insurance company s investment policies to reflect changes in the insurance company s short and long term cash needs  as well as changing business and economic conditions 
the insurance company seeks to manage its investment portfolio in part to reduce its exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
in general  the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates  and our net investment income increases or decreases in direct relationship with interest rate changes 
for example  if interest rates decline  the insurance company s fixed maturity investments generally will increase in market value  while net investment income will decrease as fixed income investments mature or are sold and proceeds are reinvested at the declining rates  and vice versa 
management is aware that prevailing market interest rates frequently shift and  accordingly  has adopted strategies that are designed to address either an increase or decrease in prevailing rates 
these strategies included the investments in payor swaptions  described below 
the insurance company s principal investments are in fixed maturities  all of which are exposed to at least one of three primary sources of investment risk credit  interest rate and market valuation 
the financial statement risks are those associated with the recognition of impairments and income  as well as the determination of fair values 
management evaluates whether other than temporary impairments have occurred on a case by case basis 
inherent in management s evaluation of each security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential 
considerations used by the insurance company in the other than temporary impairment evaluation process include  but are not limited to i the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been below amortized cost  ii the potential for impairments of securities when the issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties  iii the potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or sub sector  iv the potential for impairments in certain economically depressed geographic locations  v the potential for impairments of securities where the issuer  series of issuers or industry has a catastrophic type of loss or has exhausted natural resources  vi in situations where it is determined that an impairment is attributable to changes in market interest rates  the corporation s ability and intent to hold impaired securities until recovery of fair value at or above cost  and vii other subjective factors  including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies 
in addition  the earnings on certain investments are dependent upon market conditions  which could result in prepayments and changes in amounts to be earned due to changing interest rates or equity markets 
the determination of fair values i n the absence of quoted market values is based on valuation methodologies  securities the insurance company deems to be comparable and assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances 
there can be no assurance that the assumptions relied upon by the insurance company will yield accurate assessments of the fair value of these investments 
as such  the insurance company reassesses its assumptions regularly 
as of december   of the company s invested assets approximately million consisted of investment grade short term commercial paper 
these investments typically had credit ratings of a p or higher but in no event lower than a p and durations of days or less but in no event longer than days 
the company accumulated this volume of short term paper largely by investing the proceeds from the sale during the fourth quarter of of approximately million of long term duration assets in furtherance of the company s continuing asset liability matching efforts see liquidity and capital resources  asset liability management below  as well as approximately million in proceeds from redemptions of the company s trust preferred securities during the same period 
subsequent to december   the company has reinvested a substantial portion of this short term commercial paper into invest ment grade corporate bonds with a weighted average maturity of approximately years 
as of december   approximately of the insurance company s total invested assets were invested in limited partnerships and equity securities 
investments in limited partnerships are included in the corporation s consolidated balance sheet under the heading other long term investments 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the insurance company is committed  if called upon during a specified period  to contribute an aggregate of approximately million of additional capital to certain of these limited partnerships 
million in commitments will expire in  million in  in  in and in the insurance company may make selective investments in additional limited partnerships as opportunities arise 
in general  risks associated with such limited partnerships include those related to their underlying investments i 
e  equity securities  debt securities and real estate  plus a level of illiquidity  which is mitigated by the ability of the insurance company to take quarterly distributions of partnership earnings 
there can be no assurance that the insurance company will continue to achieve the same level of returns on its investments in limited partnerships as it has historically 
further  there can be no assurance that the insurance company will receive a return of all or any portion of its current or future capital investments in limited partnerships 
the failure of the insurance company to receive the return of a material portion of its capital investments in limited partnerships  or to achieve historic levels of return on such investments  could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
the primary market risks in the insurance company s investment portfolio are interest rate risk discussed above  credit risk and  to a lesser degree  equity price risk 
changes in credit risk are generally measured by changes in corporate yields in relation to the underlying treasuries corporate spreads as well as changes in the credit default swap cds market 
the insurance company s exposure to foreign exchange risk is insignificant 
the insurance company has no direct commodity risk 
changes in interest rates can potentially impact the corporation s profitability 
in certain scenarios where interest rates are volatile  the insurance company could be exposed to disintermediation risk asset liability mismatch and reduction in net interest rate spread or profit margin

us treasury obligations and direct obligations of us agencies the unrealized loss on us treasuries and us agencies  totaling million or of cost at december   reflects a loss of market value of these fixed rate investments due to an overall increase in interest rates since the original purchase date 
because the company has the ability and intent to hold these securities until maturity and due to the fact that these securities generally carry aaa ratings by moody s and aaa by standard and poor s  the company does not consider these securities to be other than temporarily impaired 
corporate bonds the predominant investment category for the company s investments is the corporate bond category  which totaled approximately billion at december  the million of total unrealized losses in this category reflect the combination of a general rise in interest rates subsequent to the purchase of these bonds and a widening of credit spreads in specific credits 
the k discussed credit losses in ford motor credit and knight ridder  inc both credits experienced a subsequent improvement in value in  with the ford motor credit loss declining from million at december  to a loss of  at december  with respect to knight ridder  which was purchased by mcclatchy company  an investment grade credit  the company experienced a decline in its unrealized loss from million at december  to  in during  three additional credits experienced declines in total market value where the aggregate unrealized losses exceeded both of book value and  the insurance company holds  book value of pioneer natural resources senior notes  which had an unrealized loss of  due to a lagging stock price  pioneer natural executed a stock buy back that triggered a downgrade in its credit ratings to ba by moody s  bb by standard and poors  and bb by fitch

the company is closely monitoring the financial situation of each credit but believes that these investments are not other than temporarily impaired as of december  the company believes that it has the ability and intent to hold each of these positions to maturity 
preferred stocks the insurance company had approximately  of unrealized losses on its preferred stock portfolio 
the aggregate holdings consist primarily of banks  financial companies  electric utilities and reit s real estate investment trusts 
most of the changes in market value reflect overall increases in interest rates  this condition should result in a not other than temporary impairment in value 
none of the individual losses exceed  and of book value 
common stocks the company had  of unrealized losses at december   none of which individually exceeded  and of book value 
most of these equities have readily available markets  trading on national stock exchanges  including the new york stock exchange and nasdaq 
principal protected notes between and  the insurance company made a series of investments in instruments known as principal protected notes 
these notes  marketed by investment companies  consisted of an investment in a trust unit or corporate note 
the trusts contained two assets  a variable rate income note issued by a collateralized debt obligation structure and a aaa rated zero coupon security  primarily us treasury strips  with maturity dates no later than the variable rate income note and a face value equal to the principal amount of the investment in the principal protected note 
the us treasury strip was designed to defease the principal amount of the investment  while the variable rate income note provided periodic distributions of cash flow when sufficient cash flow was generated by the collateralized debt obligation structure 
in accordance with applicable accounting rules  the company consolidates the issuers of these notes 
as a result  the assets underlying the notes the variable rate income note and the aaa rated zero coupon securities are accounted for separately within the insurance company s investment portfolio 
substantially all of the variable rate income notes were sold in the zero coupon securities are recorded at cost and annual accretions are recorded as investment income 
investment income in from such accretions amounted to approximately million 
statutory information the insurance company prepares its statutory financial statements in accordance with accounting practices prescribed by the new york state insurance department 
prescribed sap include state laws  regulations and general administrative rules  as well as a variety of publications from the naic 
accounting principles used to prepare statutory financial statements differ from financial statements prepared on the basis of gaap

there can be no assurance that the corporation s or the insurance company s ratings will continue for any given period of time or that they will not be changed 
in the event the ratings are downgraded  the level of revenues or the persistency of the insurance company s business may be adversely impacted 
in january  am best company affirmed the insurance company s rating at b very good 
publications of am best indicate that the b rating is assigned to those companies that  in am best s opinion  have achieved a very good overall performance when compared to the norms of the insurance industry and that generally have demonstrated a good ability to meet their respective policyholder and other contractual obligations over a long period of time 
the b rating is within a 
m best s secure classification  along with a  a  a  a  and b ratings 
in february  am best company reaffirmed the insurance company s rating at b very good with a stable outlook 
in  am best company changed the financial strength rating descriptor for b and b ratings on insurance companies from very good to good 
the change was made to make the rating descriptor consistent with the existing rating definition and did not  in any way  represent a change in am best s opinion of the company 
in evaluating a company s statutory financial and operating performance  am best reviews the company s profitability  leverage and liquidity  as well as the company s book of business  the adequacy and soundness of its reinsurance  the quality and estimated market value of its assets  the adequacy of its reserves and the experience and competency of its management 
am best s rating is based on factors which primarily are relevant to policyholders  agents and intermediaries and is not directed towards the protection of investors  nor is it intended to allow investors to rely on such a rating in evaluating the financial condition of the insurance company 
in june  moody s investor services moody s affirmed the insurance company s insurance financial strength at ba questionable financial security with a stable outlook  and it s rating on the corporation s senior notes at b poor financial security  with a stable outlook 
in june  standard poor s corporation standard poor s lowered the insurance company s insurance financial strength rating from a bb  which is defined as less vulnerable in the near term but faces major ongoing uncertainties to adverse business  financial and economic conditions  to a bb which is defined as a vulnerability to the broad array of risks that are embedded in its investment and operational profile 
in june  standard poors lowered the credit rating of the senior notes from a b more vulnerable to adverse business  financial a nd economic conditions but currently has the capacity to meet financial requirements to a b weak financial security  adverse business conditions will likely impair its ability to meet financial commitments  but raised the credit watch rating from negative to stable 
the downgrades from moody s and standard and poors did not have a material impact on the financial statements of the corporation for results of operations comparison of fiscal year to fiscal year and fiscal year to fiscal year operating revenues annuity considerations and life insurance premiums total annuity considerations and life insurance premiums increased to approximately million in from approximately million in  an increase of approximately and decreased from approximately million in to million in  a decrease of approximately 
life insurance premiums were million  million and million in  and respectively 
annuity considerations increased to approximately million in from approximately million in  an increase of approximately million  and decreased from approximately million in to million in  a decrease of approximately million 
these amounts do not include consideration from the sales of deferred annuities or immediate annuities without life contingencies 
under gaap  such sales are reported as additions to policyholder account balances 
consideration from such sal es was approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease from to was primarily attributable to management s decision to reduce sales in order to conserve capital and improve the company s capital and surplus ratios 
policy fee income universal life and investment type policy fee income remained stable at approximately million in fiscal years  and policy fee income consists principally of amounts assessed during the period against policyholders account balances for mortality charges and surrender charges 
net investment income net investment income totaled million in  as compared to million in and million in this represents a decrease comparing to and a 
increase comparing to the decrease from to was largely attributable to a decrease in investment income from the insurance company s limited partnership investments 
income from these investments amounted to approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  increases in income from limited partnerships and short term investments were largely offset by a decrease in income from bonds from million in to million in in  income from both the limited partnerships and fixed maturities decreased 
the decrease in the limited partnership income from to of million was largely attributable to the inherent volatility of suc h investments 
the decrease in income from fixed maturities from to and was largely the result of the portfolio rebalancing activities in and  which resulted in the sale of higher yielding long term investments and the reinvestment into lower yielding short term investments 
see item  management s discussion and analysis  asset liability management 
in addition  the company increased the portion of its portfolio invested in short term assets in the latter part of to enhance liquidity 
the insurance company s ratios of net investment income to average cash and invested assets less net investment income for the years ended december   and were approximately  and  respectively 
without taking into account the corporation s returns on its limited partnership investments in those years  the respective ratios would have been  and for the years ended december   and for additional information  please refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
net realized investment gains and losses net realized investment gains losses pre tax amounted to million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in was primarily attributable to recorded losses on the insurance company s investment in payor swaptions 
due to accounting rules governing these investments  fluctuations in market value of these investments are realized in the income statement  even if the investments  as here  continued to be held by the company 
the values of the payor swaptions were million and million for year end and  respectively 
the increase in investment gains from to was largely attributable to gains from the portfolio rebalancing activities in net realized investment gains for years ended december   and include realized investment losses of approximately million  million  and million  respectively  attributable to writedowns of certain securities contained in the insurance company s investment portfolio that were deemed by management to be other than temporarily impaired 
for a discussion of the procedure by which such determinations were made  see investments above 
realized investment gains losses also resulted from sales of certain equities and convertible securities and calls and sales of fixed maturity investments in the company s investment portfolio 
total benefits and expenses interest credited and benefits to policyholders interest credited and benefits paid to policyholders amounted to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal these represent a decrease of comparing fiscal to fiscal and a increase comparing fiscal to fiscal these amounts are consistent with the company s historic expense levels 
the insurance company s average credited rate for reserves and account balances for the years ended december   and was less than the company s ratio of net investment income to mean assets based on book value for the same period as noted above under net investment income 
although management does not currently expect material declines in the spread between the company s average credited rate for reserves and account balances and the company s ratio of net investment income to book value mean assets the spread  there can be no assurance that the spread will not decline in future periods or that such decline will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
depending  in part  upon competitive factors affecting the industry in general and the company  in particular  the company may  from time to time  change the average credited rates on certain of its products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to reduce such rates or that any such reductions will broaden the spread 
the actual spread  excluding capital gains  for the for the months ended december   and was  and  respectively 
the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the earned rate  partially offset by a decrease in the crediting rate 
interest expense on notes payable the interest expense on the corporation s notes payable amounted to approximately million in  approximately million in and approximately million in general expenses  taxes and commissions general expenses  taxes and commissions to agents totaled million in as compared to million in and million in this represents an increase of comparing to and a decrease of comparing fiscal to fiscal the increase in was primarily due to increased conservation expenses relating to fees paid to agents in an effort to keep policies in force 
the decreases in both and were principally attributable to lower costs associated with lower commissions and selling expenses incurred associated with the lower level of sales of single premium annuities 
change in deferred policy acquisition costs the change in the net dac for resulted in a charge of approximately million  as compared to a charge of approximately million and a charge of approximately million for and  respectively 
changes in dac consist of three elements deferred costs associated with product sales  amortization of the dac on deferred annuity business and amortization of the dac on the remainder of the company s business 
deferred costs consisted of credits of million  million and million for  and respectively 
amortization of the dac on deferred annuity business consisted of charges of million  million and million in  and respectively 
amortization of the dac on the remainder of the company s business consisted of charges of million in both and and million in under applicable accounting rules fasb  dac related to deferred annuities is amortized in proportion to the estimated gross profits over the estimated lives of the contracts 
essentially  as estimated profits of the insurance company related to these assets increase  the amount and timing of amortization is accelerated 
the substantial increase in the dac charge in was attributable principally to the high levels of realized gains from the company s portfolio rebalancing program and increased income from the company s limited partnership investments

income before income taxes for the reasons discussed above  income before income taxes amounted to approximately million in  as compared to approximately million in and approximately million in income taxes income tax expense was approximately million in  as compared to an expense of approximately million in and approximately million in the decrease in income taxes in fiscal was primarily attributable to a net realized investment loss in the increase from to was primarily attributable to a substantial increase in net investment gains in net income for the reasons discussed above  the corporation had net income of approximately million in  as compared to million in and million in liquidity and capital resources the corporation is an insurance holding company and its primary uses of cash are debt service obligations  operating expenses and dividend payments 
the corporation s principal sources of cash are sales of and interest on the corporation s investments and rent from its real estate 
during  the corporation s board of directors maintained the quarterly dividend rate of 
per share 
the quarterly dividend was increased to 
per share in during and  the corporation did not repurchase any of its common stock  although at december   the corporation was authorized to purchase approximately  shares of common stock 
the insurance company is subject to various regulatory restrictions on the maximum amount of payments  including loans or cash advances that it may make to the corporation without obtaining prior regulatory approval 
under the new york insurance law  the insurance company is permitted without prior insurance regulatory clearance to pay a stockholder dividend to the corporation as long as the aggregate amount of all such dividends in any calendar year does not exceed the lesser of i of its statutory surplus as of the immediately preceding calendar year or ii its statutory net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year excluding realized capital gains and losses 
the insurance company will only be permitted to pay a stockholder dividend to the corporation in excess of that amount if it files notice of its intention to declare such a dividend and the amount thereof with the superintendent and the superintendent does not disapprove the distribution 
the insurance company paid no dividends to the corporation in fiscal or in  the insurance company paid a million dividend to the corporation 
on a going forward basis  there can be no assurance that the insurance company will have statutory earnings to support payment of dividends to the corporation in an amount sufficient to fund its cash requirements and pay cash dividends or that the superintendent will not disapprove any dividends that the insurance company must submit for the superintendent s consideration 
the corporation was able to meet all its liquidity needs in  including the payment of dividends  and anticipates being able to meet those needs in and the foreseeable future 
principal sources of funds at the insurance company are premiums and other considerations paid  net investment income received and proceeds from investments called  redeemed or sold 
the principal uses of these funds are the payment of benefits on annuity contracts and life insurance policies including withdrawals and surrender payments  the payment of policy acquisition costs  operating expenses and the purchase of investments 
given the insurance company s historical cash flow and current financial results  management believes that  for the next twelve months and for the reasonably foreseeable future  the insurance company s cash flow from operating activities will provide sufficient liquidity for the operations of the insurance company 
net cash provided by the corporation s operating activities was approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net cash provided by used in in the corporation s investing activities principally reflecting investments purchased  called  redeemed or sold was approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
for purposes of the corporation s consolidated statements of cash flows  financing activities relate primarily to sales and surrenders of the insurance company s annuity and universal life insurance products 
the payment of dividends by the corporation to its stockholders is also considered to be a financing activity 
net cash used in provided by the insurance company s financing activities amounted to approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these fluctuations primarily are attributable to changes in policyholder account balances as a result of surrenders  sales and interest earned by the policyholders 
the indenture governing the senior notes contains covenants relating to limitations on liens and sale or issuance of capital stock of the corporation 
in the event the corporation violates such covenants  we may be obligated to offer to repurchase the entire outstanding principal amount of such notes 
as of december   we believe that we are in compliance with all of the covenants 
market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and other relevant market rate or price changes 
market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded 
the following is a discussion of our primary market risk exposures and how those exposures are currently managed 
we believe that a portfolio composed principally of fixed rate investments that generate predictable rates of return should back our fixed rate liabilities 
we do not have a specific target rate of return 
instead  our rates of return vary over time depending on the current interest rate environment  the slope of the yield curve  the spread at which fixed rate investments are priced over the yield curve  and general economic conditions 
our portfolio strategy is designed to achieve adequate risk adjusted returns consistent with our investment objectives of effective asset liability matching  liquidity and safety 
in order to maintain consistency in our portfolio  our deferred annuity products incorporate surrender charges to discourage surrenders or withdrawals 
annuitants may not terminate or withdraw funds from their annuity contracts for a significant initial period generally seven years without incurring penalties in the form of surrender charges 
these surrender charges generally range from to of the investment 
approximately  and of the insurance company s deferred annuity contracts in force measured by reserves as of december    and were surrenderable without charge 
the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio changes as interest rates change 
in general  rate decreases cause asset prices to rise  while rate increases cause asset prices to fall 
based on market values and prevailing interest rates as of december   a hypothetical instantaneous increase in interest rates of basis points would produce a loss in fair value of our fixed maturity assets of approximately million 
asset liability management a persistent concern of the insurance company s management is maintaining the appropriate balance between the duration of its invested assets and the duration of its contractual liabilities to its annuity holders and credit suppliers 
in the past  the insurance company had permitted the duration gap between its assets and liabilities to rise during a period in which it expected relatively stable interest rates and  most importantly  in which its liabilities were largely protected by significant annuity surrender charges 
this strategy benefited the company by allowing it to realize enhanced yield from longer duration assets 
at the end of  the insurance company determined that the prospect of rising rates and declining surrender charges necessitated a reduction in the duration mismatch  as well as increased management of extension risk in its investment portfolio 
the company developed a two step asset liability management strategy 
the first step involved a duration reduction strategy  which involved the sale of certain longer duration assets that were purchased at prices below current market prices and reinvestment in shorter duration assets 
since december   the company has completed in excess of  million of asset repositioning 
as the second element of the asset liability management strategy  the company hedged against the risks posed by a rapid and sustained rise in interest rates by entering into a form of derivative transaction known as payor swaptions 
swaptions are options to enter into an interest rate swap arrangement with a counter party at a specified future date 
at expiration  the counter party would be required to pay the insurance company the amount of the present value of the difference between the fixed rate of interest on the swap agreement and a specified strike rate in the agreement multiplied by the notional amount of the swap agreement 
the effect of these transactions would be to lessen the negative impact on the insurance company of a significant and prolonged increase in interest rates 
with the swaptions  the company should be able to maintain more competitive crediting rates to policyholders when interest rates rise 
in july  presidential life entered into a series of payor swaption investments designed to protect the company against an instantaneous rise in interest rates of basis points  as required by the new york state insurance department regulation 
six contracts against the year swap rate were executed with one dealer and three banks at a total cost of  during the rd quarter of july   presidential sold the expiring payor swaption for  realizing a capital gain of  the proceeds were reinvested into a new payor swaption with a notional value of  increased from the  notional value for the expiring payor swaption that expires on july   for a total cash consideration of  the company has established isda credit support agreements with the four counterparties 
three of the counterparties have ratings equal to or higher than aa aa by moody s and s p  respectively  and one counterparty carries an a a rating 
these contracts expire in july  july and july at varying strike rates based on the year swap rate 
the company has determined that the payor swaptions represent a non qualified hedge and has adopted accounting procedures consistent with the provisions of fas the aggregate market value of the payor swaptions as of december  was  these investments are classified on the balance sheet as derivative instruments 
under fas  the value of the payor swaptions is recognized at fair value market value  with the resulting change in fair value reflected in the statement of income as a realized loss or gain 
the change in market value during the calendar year was a loss of  the company has determined that the average fair value  based upon weekly market values for the period december  to december   was  the insurance company  in consultation with its actuarial consultant  milliman  inc  periodically assesses its overall swaption portfolio to determine if sufficient protection is provided to cover projected realized losses in the event of a liquidation of assets to satisfy annuity surrenders under the aforementioned basis points increase in interest rates 
as part of this process  presidential may consider purchasing additional swaptions as well as extending the maturity of its swaption portfolio by selling the swaptions maturing in july and purchasing a july swaption to cover future portfolio needs 
future consideration of these transactions or other asset liability management strategies is dependent upon periodic testing based on updated asset and liability data as of december  line of credit the short term notes payable relates to a line of credit issued by the bank of new york and transferred to jpmorgan chase bank in october  in the amount of  the line of credit provides for interest on borrowings based on the  and day libor rate depending on the duration of the corporation s periodic renewals 
at december   the corporation had the full  outstanding 
the line of credit renews annually and is up for renewal on july  if the bank chooses not to renew the line of credit  the corporation would be forced to pay down the  in july or seek alternative financing options 
the corporation does not believe that there would be a material adverse impact on its liquidity or cash flow position if the line of credit were to be called in july off balance sheet arrangements the corporation has not entered into any off balance sheet financing arrangements and has made no financial commitments or guarantees with any unconsolidated subsidiary or special purpose entity 
all of the corporation s subsidiaries are wholly owned and their results are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements contain information regarding payments required under existing long term borrowing arrangements 
the following presents a summary of the company s significant contractual obligations as of december  contractual obligations table payment due by period in thousands contractual obligations less than year years years after years total long term debt obligations interest on long term debt obligations policy liabilities total contractual obligations the difference between the recorded liability of  million  and the total payment obligation amount of  million  is  million and is comprised of i future interest to be credited  ii the effect of mortality discount for those payments that are life contingent  and iii the impact of surrender charges on those contracts that have such charges 
of the total payment of  million   million  or  is from the company s deferred annuity  life  and accident and health business 
determining the timing of these payments involves significant uncertainties  including mortality  morbidity  persistency  investment returns  and the timing of policyholder surrender 
notwithstanding these uncertainties  the table reflects an estimate of the timing of such payments 
long term debt obligations consist of million  senior notes due february  see note in notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financials statements for additional discussion concerning both long term and short term obligations 
effects of inflation and interest rate changes in a rising interest rate environment  the insurance company s average cost of funds would be expected to increase over time  as it prices its new and renewing annuities to maintain a generally competitive market rate 
in addition  the market value of the insurance company s fixed maturity portfolio would be expected to decrease  resulting in a decline in shareholders equity 
concurrently  the insurance company would attempt to place new funds in investments that were matched in duration to  and higher yielding than  the liabilities associated with such annuities 
moreover  surrenders of its outstanding annuities would likely accelerate 
management believes that liquidity necessary in such an interest rate environment to fund withdrawals  including surrenders  would be available through income  cash flow  the insurance company s cash reserves and  if necessary  proceeds from the cash surrender of the payor swaption investments described above and the sale of short term and long term investments 
in a declining interest rate environment  the insurance company s cost of funds would be expected to decrease over time  reflecting lower interest crediting rates on its fixed annuities 
should increased liquidity be required for withdrawals in such an interest rate environment  management believes that the portion of the insurance company s investments that are designated as available for sale in the corporation s consolidated balance sheet could be sold without materially adverse consequences in light of the general strengthening in market prices that would be expected in the fixed maturity security market 
interest rate changes also may have temporary effects on the sale and profitability of our annuity products 
for example  if interest rates rise  competing investments such as annuity or life insurance products offered by the insurance company s competitors  certificates of deposit  mutual funds and similar instruments may become more attractive to potential purchasers of the insurance company s products until the insurance company increases the rates credited to holders of its annuity products 
in contrast  as interest rates fall  we would attempt to lower our credited rates to compensate for the corresponding decline in net investment income 
as a result  changes in interest rates could materially adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of the insurance company depending on the attractiveness of alternative investments available to the insurance company s customers 
in that regard  in the current inte rest rate environment  the insurance company has attempted to maintain it s credited rates at competitive levels designed to discourage surrenders and also to be considered attractive to purchasers of new annuity products 
recent accounting pronouncements see note  item o  notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full description of the new accounting pronouncements including the respective dates of adoption and the effects on the results of operations and financial condition 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the critical accounting policies  estimates and related judgments underlying the corporation s consolidated financial statements are summarized below 
in applying these accounting policies  management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
many of these policies  estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries  others are specific to the insurance company s business operations 
investments the insurance company s principal investments are in fixed maturities  all of which are exposed to at least one of three primary sources of investment risk credit  interest rate and market valuation 
the financial statement risks are those associated with the recognition of other than temporary impairments and income  as well as the determination of fair values 
recognition of income ceases when a bond goes into default and management evaluates whether temporary or other than temporary impairments have occurred on a case by case basis 
management considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause and decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near term recovery 
inherent in management s evaluation of the security are a ssumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential 
considerations used by the company in the other than temporary impairment evaluation process include  but are not limited to i the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been below amortized cost  ii whether the issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties  iii financial difficulties being experienced by an entire industry sector or sub sector  iv economically depressed geographic locations  v situations where the issuer  series of issuers or industry has a catastrophic type of loss or has exhausted natural resources  vi in situations where it is determined that an impairment is attributable to changes in market interest rates  the corporation s ability and intent to hold impaired securities until recovery of fair value at or above cost  and vii other subjective factors  including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating age ncies 
in addition  the earnings on certain investments are dependent upon market conditions  which could result in prepayments and changes in amounts to be earned due to changing interest rates or equity markets 
the determination of fair values in the absence of quoted market values is based on valuation methodologies  securities the company deems to be comparable and assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances 
the use of different methodologies and assumptions may have a material effect of the estimated fair value amounts 
however  the company believes that the estimates it uses in determining other than temporary impairment and fair value are realistic  conservative and fairly state the value of its investments 
the company uses the equity method of accounting for investments in limited partnership interests in which it has more than a minor equity interest  or more than a minor influence over the joint ventures and partnership s operations  but does not have a controlling interest and is not the primary beneficiary 
the company routinely evaluates its limited partnership investments for impairments 
the company considers financial and other information provided by the investee and other known information and inherent risks in the underlying investments in determining whether an impairment has occurred 
when an other than temporary impairment is deemed to have occurred  the company records a realized capital loss within net investment income to record the investment at its fair value 
investment income from limited partnerships is recorded based on the company s share of earnings reported in the partnership s most recent audited f inancial statements and income distributed by the partnerships 
management considers the quarterly financial information received from the limited partnerships to be unreliable or insufficient to record investment income  other than from distributions  on a quarterly basis 
management estimates the classification of cash distributions received between investment income and return of capital based on correspondence from the respective partnerships 
the company adjusts its estimate of investment income recorded during the year to the actual realized gains and other income reported in the limited partnerships most recent annual audited financial statements  which are generally received in the second quarter of the subsequent year 
as a result  there is a six month reporting lag for recording investment income that is not distributed during the year  which may result in significant adjustments 
the company records its share of net unrealized gains and losses net of taxes fro m the audited financial statements of the limited partnerships 
as a result  there is a six month reporting lag for reporting unrealized gains and losses  which may result in significant adjustments to other comprehensive income in because it is not practicable to obtain an independent valuation for each limited partnership interest  for purposes of disclosure the market value of a limited partnership interest is estimated at book value based on the most recent available audited financial statements 
the failure of the insurance company to receive the return of a material portion of its capital investments in limited partnerships  or to achieve historic levels of return on such investments  could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
deferred policy acquisition costs the insurance company incurs significant costs in connection with acquiring new business 
under applicable accounting rules  these costs  which vary  are deferred 
the recovery of such costs is dependent upon the future profitability of the related product  which in turn is dependent mainly on investment returns in excess of interest credited  as well as persistency and expenses 
these factors enter into management s estimate of future gross profits  which generally are used to amortize such costs 
changes in these estimates result in changes to the amounts expensed in the reporting period in which the revisions are made and could result in the impairment of the deferred acquisition cost asset and a charge to income if estimated future gross profits are less than amounts deferred 
to demonstrate the sensitivity of our net dac balance million as of december  relative to our future spreads and expenses  the information below indicates how much the net dac balance would have changed if the future spread assumption decreased by and if the future expense assumption increased by 
we believe that any variation in our expense or spread estimate is likely to fall within these ranges 
change in assumption decrease in net dac asset future spread decreases million future expenses increase million future policy benefits the insurance company establishes liabilities for amounts payable under life and health insurance policies and annuity contracts 
generally  these amounts are payable over a long period of time and the profitability of the products is dependent on the pricing 
principal assumptions used in pricing policies and in the establishment of liabilities for future policy benefits are investment returns  mortality  expenses and persistency 
the reserves reflected in the corporation s consolidated financial statements included herein are calculated based on gaap and differ from those specified by the laws of the various states in which the insurance company does business and those reflected in the insurance company s statutory financial statements 
these differences arise from the use of different mortality and morbidity tables and interest rate assumptions  the introduction of lapse assumptions into the reserve calculation and the use of the net level premium reserve method on all insurance business 
see notes g  h and to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the reserves reflected in the corporation s consolidated financial statements are based upon the corporation s best estimates of mortality  persistency  expenses and investment income  with appropriate provisions for adverse statistical deviation and the use of the net level premium method for all non interest sensitive products 
for all interest sensitive products  the policy account value is equal to the accumulation of gross premiums plus interest credited less mortality and expense charges and withdrawals 
in determining reserves for its insurance and annuity products  the insurance company performs periodic studies to compare current experience for mortality  interest and lapse rates with expected experience in the reserve assumptions 
differences are reflected currently in earnings for each period 
for policies and contracts where the reserve is reported as the account balance  million  a change in expected experience would have no effect on the reserve 
for those annuities and supplementary contracts with life contingencies that comprise a portion of future policy benefits million of reserves  an increase in mortality experience of per year for individual contracts would increase the present value of future benefits by approximately million 
we believe that any variation of our mortality estimates is likely to fall within this range 
for traditional life insurance business million of reserves  establishing reserves requires the use of many assumptions 
due to the number of independent variables inherent in the calculation of these reserves  and because this business is not material to the overall company results  it is not practical to perform a quantitative analysis on the impact of changes in underlying assumptions 
however  the insurance company historically has not experienced significant adverse deviations from its assumptions and believes that its assumptions are realistic and produce reserves that are fairly stated in accordance with gaap 
income taxes income taxes are recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

in accordance with sfas no 
 for all years presented we use the asset and liability method to record deferred income taxes 
accordingly  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized that reflect the net tax effect of the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes  using enacted tax rates 
such temporary differences are primarily due to tax basis of reserves for future policy benefits  deferred acquisition costs  and net operating loss carry forwards 
a valuation allowance is applied to deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that all  or some portion  of the benefits related to the deferred tax assets will not be realized
