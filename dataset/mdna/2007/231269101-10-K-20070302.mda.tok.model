item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read together with selected financial data  and our financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance  that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many important factors  including those set forth under item a  risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a drug discovery and development company that is seeking to leverage our innovative biological signaling pathway drug technologies to create new medicines primarily in the field of cancer  and also to treat several other medical indications for which there are substantial unmet therapeutic needs 
biological signaling pathways  also referred to as signaling pathways  are prominent regulators of specific tissue and organ formation during prenatal development and are used by the body throughout life to repair and regulate human tissue 
our product development approach involves using small molecules  proteins or antibodies to modulate these regulatory signaling pathways  for example  to increase the pathway signals when they are insufficient or to decrease them when they are excessive 
in expanding our drug development efforts in the field of cancer  we are building upon our previous experiences in targeting signaling pathways in the areas of cancer  neurological disease  hair growth regulation and cardiovascular disease 
since our inception  we have funded our operations primarily through license fees  research and development funding from our strategic collaborators  the private and public placement of our equity securities  debt financings and the monetization of certain royalty rights 
we have never been profitable and have incurred an accumulated deficit of  as of december  we expect to incur significant operating losses for the next several years as we devote substantially all of our resources to research and development of our product candidates 
we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability and do not expect to achieve profitability in the foreseeable future  if at all 
a key driver to our success will be our ability to successfully advance the preclinical development of our internally developed targeted cancer drug development programs  to commence and complete clinical trials  both for our internally developed programs and in collaboration with our strategic collaborators and to successfully commercialize products on the basis of these programs 
our research programs are conducted both internally and through strategic collaborations 
our most advanced program is our hedgehog antagonist program that is under collaboration with genentech 
genentech is currently conducting a patient phase i clinical trial to test a systemically administered hedgehog antagonist in cancers 
the primary objectives of the phase i clinical trial are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of the phase i molecule and to establish the maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicities 
early in  we launched our targeted cancer drug development platform programs  which are focused upon designing multiple classes of multi targeted drugs for cancer therapy 
in addition to these proprietary cancer programs  we currently have strategic collaborations with genentech  procter gamble  and wyeth to develop therapeutics that modulate the signaling of the hedgehog pathway 
we have a second collaboration with genentech focusing on the discovery and development of small molecule modulators of another cancer signaling pathway 
we have licensed our bmp pathway patent portfolio to ortho biotech products  a subsidiary of johnson johnson  for systemic administration in all non orthopedic and non dental therapeutic applications 
in  centocor  another subsidiary of johnson johnson  entered into a new agreement with us whereby centocor is funding a portion of a new curis bmp small molecule screening program 

table of contents our current strategic collaborations and license agreements generally provide for our research  development and commercialization programs to be wholly or majority funded by our collaborators and provide us with the opportunity to receive additional payments if specified development objectives  regulatory approval and sales objectives  are achieved 
we are also entitled to receive royalty payments upon the successful commercialization of any products based upon the collaboration 
these strategic collaboration and license agreements included  in up front payments  of which we received  in non refundable license payments and  from the sale of shares of our common stock 
in addition  we received  from the funding of our research and development personnel 
these collaborations also include approximately  in contingent cash payments that are tied to the achievement of future preclinical and clinical development objectives  regulatory approval and sales objectives 
going forward  we intend to add clinical development and regulatory capacities in and beyond and we will seek to advance one or more of our proprietary multi target cancer programs into early stages of clinical testing 
we also plan to continue to seek corporate collaborators for the further development and commercialization of at least one of our multi target cancer programs from our targeted cancer drug development platform 
when evaluating potential collaborative opportunities  we plan to seek to retain significant rights and involvement and or control in at least the early stages of clinical development 
in some cases  we have retained rights under our programs under collaboration  including co development rights and development and commercialization rights in specific therapeutic areas where we believe we can attain additional value through the application of our own internal resources 
examples of retained rights within our programs under collaboration include co development rights relating to a hair growth product candidate in exchange for a higher royalty rate under our dermatological hedgehog agonist collaboration with procter gamble  as well as retained rights to our hedgehog agonist for topical applications  for local delivery in cardiovascular applications and for ex vivo use under our broad hedgehog agonist collaboration with wyeth 
financial operations overview general 
our future operating results will largely depend on the magnitude of payments from our current and potential future corporate collaborators and the progress of other product candidates currently in our research and development pipeline 
the results of our operations will vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter and depend on  among other factors  the timing of our entry into new collaborations  the timing of the receipt of payments from collaborators and the cost and outcome of any clinical trials then being conducted 
we believe that our existing capital resources at december   together with the payment of all contractually defined research funding payments but excluding any cash payments that are contingent upon the achievement of defined development objectives under our collaborations and research programs with genentech  wyeth  and procter gamble  assuming these programs continue as planned  should enable us to maintain current and planned operations into the fourth quarter of our ability to continue funding our planned operations beyond the fourth quarter of is dependent upon the success of our collaborations  our ability to control our cash burn rate and our ability to raise additional funds through equity  debt or other sources of financing 
a discussion of certain risks and uncertainties that could affect our liquidity  capital requirements and ability to raise additional funds is set forth under item a  risk factors 
revenue 
we do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products for several years  if ever 
substantially all of our gross revenues to date have been derived from license fees  research and development payments  and other amounts that we have received from our strategic collaborators and licensees  including genentech  wyeth  procter gamble  and ortho biotech products centocor 
our share of the basal cell carcinoma co development costs have been be recorded as a reduction to any revenue recognized under our collaborations with genentech in accordance with eitf on august   we ceased our participation in co development and we do not expect to record any additional contra revenues 
genentech will be solely responsible for all development costs subsequent to august   and we are entitled to cash payments upon the occurrence of certain development objectives and royalties on product sales  if any should occur 

table of contents research funding remaining for our existing collaborations consists of payments by wyeth for five researchers through february  and payments by genentech for twelve researchers  including three outsourced chemists  through march  accordingly  for the majority of our programs under collaboration  our future revenues are limited to the amortization of previously paid license fees and to cash payments  if any  that are contingent upon the successful completion of contractually defined development  regulatory  and product sales objectives 
in the future  we will seek to generate revenues from a combination of license fees  research and development funding  milestone payments and royalties resulting from strategic collaborations relating to the development of products that incorporate our intellectual property  and from sales of any products we successfully develop and commercialize  either alone or in collaboration 
we expect that any revenues we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing and amount of payments received under our existing and any future strategic collaborations and license arrangements  and the amount and timing of payments that we receive upon the sale of our products  to the extent that any are successfully commercialized 
research and development 
research and development expense consists of costs incurred to discover  research and develop our product candidates 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  including  beginning on january   stock based compensation expense for employee share based payments 
research and development expenses also include the costs of supplies and reagents  outside service costs including medicinal chemistry  consulting  and occupancy and depreciation charges 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
we believe that our research and development expenses will neither increase nor decrease significantly in we expect  however  that a majority of our research and development effort and expense will shift from our work primarily in the hedgehog pathway and our various discovery programs  to the development of programs under our targeted cancer drug development platform 
we also expect in future years we will maintain approximately the same number of researchers as we currently employ  but will increase our clinical development and regulatory capacities 
in addition  in the near term we expect to continue contracting between medicinal chemists in an effort to rapidly advance our programs under the targeted cancer drug development platform 
except for our systemically administered hedgehog antagonist program  our programs are in various stages of preclinical drug development 
the table below summarizes our primary research and development programs  including the current development status of each program 
the terms used in the chart below are as follows phase i means that we or a collaborator are currently treating human patients in a phase i clinical trial  the principal purpose of which is to evaluate the safety of the compound being tested  lead means that from testing in several preclinical model of human disease we have selected a lead candidate for potential future clinical development and that we are seeking to complete the relevant safety  toxicology  and other data required to file an investigational new drug application with the fda seeking to commence a phase i clinical trial  preclinical means we are seeking to obtain demonstrations of therapeutic efficacy in preclinical models of human disease  and discovery means that we are searching for compounds that may be relevant for treating a particular disease area 

table of contents because of the early stages of development of these programs  our ability and that of our collaborators and licensors to successfully complete preclinical and clinical studies of these product candidates  and the timing of completion of such programs  is highly uncertain 
product candidate primary indication collaborator licensee status hedgehog systemic small molecule or antibody antagonist cancer genentech phase i multi target a b inhibitors cancer internal development preclinical undisclosed pathway cancer genentech discovery hedgehog small molecule agonist or protein nervous system disorders wyeth preclinical hedgehog small molecule agonist hair growth procter gamble preclinical bmp protein kidney disease and other disorders ortho biotech products centocor preclinical hedgehog agonist protein gene cardiovascular disease wyeth internal development preclinical bmp small molecule agonists kidney disease and other disorders centocor discovery because of the early stages of these programs  the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain 
there are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs  including the scope  quality of data  rate of progress and cost of clinical trials and other research and development activities undertaken by us or our collaborators  the results of future clinical trials  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost and timing of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates and any products that we may develop  the effect of competing technological and market developments  and the cost and effectiveness of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of  or the period in which material net cash inflows are expected to commence from any of our product candidates 
any failure to complete the development of our product candidates in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial position and liquidity 
a further discussion of some of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing our research and development programs on schedule  or at all  and some consequences of failing to do so  are set forth below in part i item a  risk factors 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  business development  legal  information technology  corporate communications and human resource functions 
these expenses include stock based compensation expense for employee share based payments beginning on january  other costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expense  insurance  and professional fees for legal  patent and accounting services 
assuming that our stock based compensation expense does not change materially  we believe that our general and administrative expenses may decline modestly in the short term 

table of contents strategic collaborations and license agreements 
since inception  substantially all of our revenues have been derived from collaborations and other research and development arrangements with third parties 
our current strategic collaborations and key license agreements are with genentech  wyeth  procter gamble and ortho biotech products 
these strategic license and collaboration agreements included  in up front payments  including  in non refundable license payments and  from the sale of shares of our common stock   from the funding of our research and development personnel and also include approximately  in contingent cash payments that are tied to the achievement of future clinical development objectives  regulatory approval  and sales objectives 
receipt of all of these contingent payments would occur only if all of the collaborations continue for their full terms  multiple products for multiple indications are successfully developed  and all specified research  development  regulatory approval and sales objectives are achieved 
our collaborations and licenses are summarized as follows genentech hedgehog antagonist collaboration 
in june  we entered into a collaboration agreement with genentech that included continued development of our systemically administered hedgehog antagonist drug candidates for the treatment of cancer

genentech also made license maintenance fee payments totaling  over the first two years of the collaboration 
we have entered into three amendments to the june collaboration agreement 
pursuant to the amendments  genentech increased the number of researchers that it would fund and extended its funding obligation through december as part of these amendments  genentech provided us with  in incremental research funding over the period from december to december the funded research program ended in december we do not expect to incur any further material research expenses for this program 
in january  genentech treated the first patient in a phase i clinical trial for the first systemically administered hedgehog antagonist covered under our collaboration 
genentech paid us a  substantive milestone payment upon filing the investigational new drug application for this trial in the fourth quarter of genentech has assumed all future responsibility for the clinical development of the hedgehog small molecule and antibody antagonists 
in the future  we will receive cash payments from genentech only upon the achievement of certain clinical development objectives as well as royalties on product sales if product clinical evaluations are successful and the resulting products are successfully commercialized 
genentech discovery research collaboration 
in april  we entered into a collaboration agreement with genentech for discovery and development of small molecule compounds that modulate an unspecified cell signaling pathway 
under the terms of the agreement  we granted genentech an exclusive royalty bearing license to make  use and sell the small molecule compounds that are modulators of the pathway 
we have rights for ex vivo cell therapy  except in the areas of oncology and hematopoiesis 
we have primary responsibility for research and development activities and genentech is mainly responsible for clinical development  manufacturing  and commercializing products that may result from the collaboration 
genentech paid us an up front license fee of  and has agreed to fund up to  for research and development activities during the initial two year research term 
genentech has also agreed to make cash payments to us that are contingent upon the successful achievement of certain research  development  clinical and drug approval objectives 
genentech has also agreed to pay us royalties on net product sales if product candidates derived from the collaboration are successfully commercialized 

table of contents wyeth hedgehog agonist collaboration 
in january  we entered into a collaboration agreement with wyeth to continue the development of our hedgehog agonist drug candidates for the treatment of neurological disorders and other potential indications 
under the terms of the agreement  we granted wyeth an exclusive  royalty bearing license  with the right to sublicense  to make  use  sell and import  small molecule and protein agonists of the hedgehog signaling pathway as systemic treatments for neurological and other disorders  including systemic treatment of cardiovascular disease 
we retained development and licensing rights for certain therapeutic applications of the hedgehog agonist technologies  including topical applications for the treatment of skin diseases and disorders and the promotion of hair growth in humans  local delivery applications for treatment of cardiovascular disease and ex vivo use for the preparation of cells to be used in cell therapy applications 
wyeth has a right of first negotiation to obtain an exclusive license to the local delivery cardiovascular applications 
we have responsibilities to perform certain funded preclinical research activities 
wyeth also performs preclinical research and has primary responsibility for clinical development  regulatory affairs  manufacturing and supply  formulation and sales and marketing 
wyeth has agreed to assume all future responsibility for clinical development of the hedgehog small molecule and protein agonists as systemic treatments for neurological and other disorders 
as part of the agreement  we have retained development and licensing options for certain therapeutic applications of hedgehog agonist technologies  including local delivery applications for treatment of cardiovascular disease 
wyeth has a right of first negotiation to obtain an exclusive license to the local cardiovascular applications of the hedgehog agonist technology 
if wyeth declines its option  or if we are unable to reach an agreement with wyeth on terms within the contractually specified period  we are free to seek another collaborator for this program 
under the terms of the collaboration  wyeth paid us up front payments totaling  including a non refundable license fee payment of  and a payment of  in exchange for  shares of our common stock 
wyeth was also obligated to provide at least two years of research funding 
wyeth has twice extended its research funding and wyeth is now obligated  subject to its termination rights  to provide us with research funding until at least february  through december   wyeth has provided to us an aggregate of  in research funding 
in addition  wyeth is obligated to make cash payments of up to  to us upon the achievement of certain preclinical and clinical development objectives  assuming at least two products are successfully developed and commercialized 
if any hedgehog agonist technology based products are successfully commercialized  wyeth is obligated to pay us royalties on product sales that escalate with increasing sales volume 
procter gamble hedgehog agonist collaboration for hair growth and skin disorders 
in september  we entered into a collaboration agreement with procter gamble to evaluate and develop potential treatments for hair growth regulation and skin disorders utilizing topically applied hedgehog agonist compounds 
under the terms of the agreement  we granted to procter gamble an exclusive  worldwide  royalty bearing license for the development and commercialization of topical dermatological and hair growth products that incorporate our hedgehog agonist technology 
procter gamble is solely responsible for the cost of worldwide development and commercialization of any product candidates developed pursuant to the research program  provided however  that at the time that procter gamble determines to file the first investigational new drug application with the fda for a product candidate  we shall have the option  at our sole discretion  to co develop a product candidate through phases i and iib of clinical development 
procter gamble has paid us an up front license fee of  and has funded  for two of our full time equivalent employees to provide research and development activities during the initial one year research term 
procter gamble has also agreed to make cash payments to us that are contingent upon the successful achievement of certain preclinical development  clinical development and drug approval milestones 
in march  we reached the first preclinical development objective under this collaboration for which we received a  cash payment 

table of contents procter gamble will also pay us royalties on net product sales if product candidates derived from the collaboration are successfully developed 
we will receive a higher royalty in the event that we exercise our co development option and subsequently share in development expenses through phase iib clinical trials  but we would forego contingent cash payments that would otherwise be payable for the achievement of certain development objectives during the co development time period 
ortho biotech products bmp license 
in november  we entered into an agreement with ortho biotech products pursuant to which ortho biotech obtained the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize products based on our bmp technology and assumed control of the continued development of this kidney disease product candidate 
pursuant to the agreement  ortho biotech paid us an up front payment of  ortho biotech has assumed all future costs and responsibility for bmp based product development 
we will receive a series of cash payments that are contingent upon the achievement of certain clinical development objectives  as well as royalties on product sales if any bmp based products are successfully commercialized 
in  johnson johnson moved responsibility for the future development of bmp to its centocor subsidiary 
centocor has sole responsibility for deciding if and when human clinical trials of bmp protein will begin 
centocor bmp agonist small molecule screening program 
in december  we entered into an agreement with centocor 
under the new agreement  we are screening for small molecule agonists that mimic the bioactivity of the bmp protein and activate the bone morphogenetic pathway for which we received  in research funding of this program 
the term of the agreement is expected to end march we will own any small molecule bmp agonist compounds that are discovered as part of this screening and centocor will have an exclusive option to first negotiate a new collaboration and exclusive license agreement for the further development and commercialization of such small molecules 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosure of certain assets and liabilities at our balance sheet date 
such estimates and judgments include the carrying value of property and equipment and intangible assets  revenue recognition  the value of certain liabilities and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in our consolidated financial statements  we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding the judgments and estimates we use in preparing our financial statements revenue recognition 
our business strategy includes entering into collaborative license and development agreements with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies for the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
the terms of the agreements typically include non refundable license fees  funding of research and development  payments based upon achievement of clinical development milestones and royalties on product sales 
we follow the provisions of the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  and eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 

table of contents license fees and multiple element arrangements 
non refundable license fees are recognized as revenue when we have a contractual right to receive such payment  the contract price is fixed or determinable  the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations under the license agreement 
multiple element arrangements  such as license and development arrangements are analyzed to determine whether the deliverables  which often include a license and performance obligations such as research and steering committee services  can be separated or whether they must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting in accordance with eitf we recognize up front license payments as revenue upon delivery of the license only if the license has stand alone value and the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations  typically including research and or steering committee services  can be determined 
if the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations can be determined  such obligations would then be accounted for separately as performed 
if the license is considered to either i not have stand alone value or ii have standalone value but the fair value of any of the undelivered performance obligations cannot be determined  the arrangement would then be accounted for as a single unit of accounting and the license payments and payments for performance obligations are recognized as revenue over the estimated period of when the performance obligations are performed 
whenever we determine that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we must determine the period over which the performance obligations will be performed and revenue will be recognized 
revenue will be recognized using either a relative performance or straight line method 
we recognize revenue using the relative performance method provided that we can reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement and such performance obligations are provided on a best efforts basis 
direct labor hours or full time equivalents are typically used as the measure of performance 
revenue recognized under the relative performance method would be determined by multiplying the total payments under the contract  excluding royalties and payments contingent upon achievement of substantive milestones  by the ratio of level of effort incurred to date to estimated total level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under the arrangement 
revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned  as determined using the relative performance method  as of each reporting period 
if we cannot reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement  the performance obligations are provided on a best efforts basis and we can reasonably estimate when the performance obligation ceases or becomes inconsequential  then the total payments under the arrangement  excluding royalties and payments contingent upon achievement of substantive milestones  would be recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the period we expect to complete our performance obligations 
revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned  as determined using the straight line basis  as of the period ending date 
if we cannot reasonably estimate when our performance obligation either ceases or becomes inconsequential  then revenue is deferred until we can reasonably estimate when the performance obligation ceases or becomes inconsequential 
significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which we are expected to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement 
in addition  if we are involved in a steering committee as part of a multiple element arrangement that is accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we assess whether our involvement constitutes a performance obligation or a right to participate 
steering committee services that are not inconsequential or perfunctory and that are determined to be performance obligations are combined with other research services or performance obligations required under an arrangement  if any  in determining the level of effort required in an arrangement and the period over which we expect to complete our aggregate performance obligations 

table of contents substantive milestone payments 
our collaboration agreements may also contain substantive milestone payments 
substantive milestone payments are considered to be performance bonuses that are recognized upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following conditions are met the milestone payments are non refundable  achievement of the milestone involves a degree of risk and was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone  the amount of the milestone payment is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with achievement of the milestone  and  a reasonable amount of time passes between the up front license payment and the first milestone payment as well as between each subsequent milestone payment 
determination as to whether a payment meets the aforementioned conditions involves management s judgment 
if any of these conditions are not met  the resulting payment would not be considered a substantive milestone  and therefore the resulting payment would be considered part of the consideration for the single unit of accounting and be recognized as revenue as such performance obligations are performed under either the relative performance or straight line methods  as applicable  and in accordance with these policies as described above 
in addition  the determination that one such payment was not a substantive milestone could prevent us from concluding that subsequent milestone payments were substantive milestones and  as a result  any additional milestone payments could also be considered part of the consideration for the single unit of accounting and would be recognized as revenue as such performance obligations are performed under either the relative performance or straight line methods  as applicable 
reimbursement of costs 
reimbursement of costs is recognized as revenue provided the provisions of eitf are met  the amounts are determinable  and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
royalty revenue 
royalty revenue is recognized upon the sale of the related products  provided that the royalty amounts are fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and we have no remaining performance obligations under the arrangement 
if royalties are received when we have remaining performance obligations  the royalty payments would be attributed to the services being provided under the arrangement and therefore would be recognized as such performance obligations are performed under either the relative performance or straight line methods  as applicable  and in accordance with these policies as described above 
payments from curis as a vendor to a collaborator as a customer 
for revenue generating arrangements where we  as a vendor  provide consideration to a licensor or collaborator  as a customer  we apply the provisions of eitf eitf addresses the accounting for revenue arrangements where both the vendor and the customer make cash payments to each other for services and or products 
a payment to a customer is presumed to be a reduction of the selling price unless we receive an identifiable benefit for the payment and we can reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit received 
payments to a customer that are deemed a reduction of selling price are recorded first as a reduction of revenue  to the extent of both cumulative revenue recorded to date and of probable future revenues  which include any unamortized deferred revenue balances  under all arrangements with such customer and then as an expense 
payments that are not deemed to be a reduction of selling price would be recorded as an expense 

table of contents amounts received prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
although we follow detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
for example  in connection with our existing collaboration agreements  we have recorded on our balance sheet short and long term deferred revenue based on our best estimate of when such revenue will be recognized 
short term deferred revenue consists of amounts that are expected to be recognized as revenue  or applied against future co development costs  by december  amounts that we expect will not be recognized prior to december  are classified as long term deferred revenue 
however  this estimate is based on our operating plan as of december  and on our estimated performance periods under the collaboration in which we have recorded deferred revenues 
if our operating plan or our estimated performance period should change in the future  we may recognize a different amount of deferred revenue over the twelve month period from january  through december  as of december   we have short term and long term deferred revenue of  and  respectively  related to our collaborations 
the estimate of deferred revenue also reflects management s estimate of the periods of our involvement in certain of our collaborations 
our performance obligations under these collaborations consist of participation on steering committees and the performance of other research and development services 
in certain instances  the timing of satisfying these obligations can be difficult to estimate 
accordingly  our estimates may change in the future 
such changes to estimates would result in a change in revenue recognition amounts 
if these estimates and judgments change over the course of these agreements  it may affect the timing and amount of revenue that we recognize and record in future periods 
stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we followed accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb and related interpretations in accounting for share based payments and had elected the disclosure only alternative under sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
accordingly  when options granted to employees had an exercise price equal to the market value of the stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense was recognized in our financial statements 
sfas r eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb  and generally requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
we have adopted the modified prospective transition method and determined fair value for a majority of our options using the black scholes valuation model 
in june  we had granted options to our directors  officers and certain employees that contained a market condition 
as of january    shares related to these market condition options remained unvested 
sfas r requires that awards with market conditions be valued using a lattice model 
accordingly  we measured the fair value of the market condition options using a lattice model 
we have recorded employee stock based compensation expense of  for the year ended december  employee stock based compensation expense of  and  for years ended december  and  respectively  was recorded applying apb for the options outstanding as of december   we estimate that we will record approximately  to  in stock based compensation expense under sfas r in we expect that we will issue additional options in that will increase the amount of stock based compensation ultimately recognized 
the amount of the incremental employee stock based compensation expense attributable to employee stock awards will depend primarily on the number of stock awards issued to employees in  the fair market value of our common stock at the respective grant dates  and the specific terms of the stock award 
the valuation of employee stock options is an inherently subjective process  since market values are generally not available for long term  non transferable employee stock options 
accordingly  an option pricing model is utilized to derive an estimated fair value 
in calculating the estimated fair value of our stock options  we 
table of contents used a black scholes pricing model for a majority of our stock awards and  for a small subset of our awards that contained a market condition  a lattice model as discussed above 
both of these models require the consideration of the following six variables for purposes of estimating fair value the stock option exercise price the expected term of the option the grant date price of our common stock the expected volatility of our common stock the expected dividends on our common stock  which we do not anticipate paying for the foreseeable future  and the risk free interest rate for the expected option term of the variables above  we believe that the selection of an expected term and expected stock price volatility are the most subjective 
the majority of the employee stock option expense recorded in the year ended december  relates to continued vesting of stock options that were granted prior to january  in accordance with the transition provisions of sfas r  the grant date estimates of fair value associated with prior awards have not been changed 
the specific valuation assumptions that were utilized for purposes of deriving an estimate of fair value at the time that prior awards were issued are as disclosed in our prior annual reports on form k  as filed with the sec 
upon adoption of sfas r  we were also required to estimate the level of award forfeitures expected to occur  and record compensation expense only for those awards that we ultimately expect will vest 
this requirement applies to all awards that are not yet vested  including awards granted prior to january  accordingly  we performed a historical analysis of option awards that were forfeited prior to vesting  and recorded total stock option expense that reflected this estimated forfeiture rate for each of the quarterly periods in this analysis is re evaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary to reflect the actual forfeitures for the reporting period 
ultimately  the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those shares that vest 
short term receivables 
on october   we amended a note receivable with micromet  a former collaborator 
under the amended note  micromet is obligated to pay curis a total amount of  subject to certain conditions 
this note had been fully written down in we received payments totaling  from micromet in and the remaining  due under the amended note was payable to us upon the achievement by micromet of certain financing objectives or upon an exit event  as defined in the amended note 
we asserted that the conditions precedent to the payment of the remaining  had been achieved through micromet s may merger with cancervax  a claim that micromet disputed 
as a result  we filed a lawsuit in germany during the second quarter of in september  we agreed to a court proposed settlement agreement with micromet to resolve this claim 
in accordance with the settlement  micromet agreed to pay us  due on november   and  due on may  should micromet make the second payment on or before april   the second payment would decrease to  the first payment of  or  was received on october  we expect that micromet will elect to prepay the second installment of  which is approximately  using december  currency exchange rates 
accordingly  we have recorded a receivable in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  future changes in currency exchange rates may increase or decrease the actual amount of us dollars received by us

table of contents lives of the related assets using the straight line method 
determining the economic lives of property and equipment requires us to make significant judgments that can materially impact our operating results 
we assess the impairment of identifiable long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in addition  we perform a goodwill impairment test annually 
since january   we have applied the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangibles 
sfas no 
requires us to perform an impairment assessment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that our goodwill may be impaired 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment tests in december  and  and determined that as of those dates our fair value exceeded the carrying value of our net assets 
accordingly  no goodwill impairment was recognized in  and if it were determined that the carrying value of our other long lived assets might not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we would measure an impairment based on application of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
during  we initiated a realignment of our research programs  focusing on later stage preclinical drug development programs and de emphasizing our earlier discovery research programs 
during the year ended december   we recognized an impairment charge of  related to certain of our equipment used in our discovery programs 
in addition  we revised our estimates of the depreciable lives on the remaining equipment currently being used in our discovery research programs as a result of two of our discovery programs ending the sponsored research agreement with the sma foundation  which ended in the fourth quarter of  and the april drug discovery collaboration with genentech  which will end during the first quarter of beginning in the fourth quarter of  equipment with a book value of  is being depreciated over a period ending in march  and equipment with a book value of  is being depreciated over a period ending in december  which will result in total depreciation expense on these assets of  in and  in we will continue to review our estimate of remaining useful lives related to assets currently being used on our remaining discovery programs  which had a net book value of  as of december  any future changes to the estimated useful lives of our assets could have a material impact on our financial statements 
in september  we were notified that a former privately held collaborator of ours  aegera therapeutics  inc  in which we own equity securities  was trying to secure additional financing at a value that was significantly less than the current carrying value of aegera stock we had recorded 
we believed that the terms of aegera s planned financing adversely affected the carrying value of our equity investment in aegera 
as a result  during the third quarter of the year ended december   we wrote down the carrying value of our investment in aegera equity securities by  from  to the above list is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result

in addition  stock based compensation expense decreased  during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
the decrease in stock based compensation was primarily attributable to a decrease of compensation expense recorded on options to purchase common stock that were issued to employees below fair market value on august  as of august   all of these options became fully vested  therefore  no related additional expense was recognized beyond august the decrease in stock based compensation was also attributable to options issued to non employees that are marked to market

at december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities of  excluding restricted long term investments of  our cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at date of purchase and consist of time deposits and investments in money market funds with commercial banks and financial institutions  short term commercial paper  and government obligations 
we also maintain cash balances with financial institutions in excess of insured limits 
we do not anticipate any losses with respect to such cash balances because the balances are invested in highly rated securities 
our marketable securities are investments with expected maturities of greater than three months  but less than twelve months  and consist of commercial paper  corporate debt securities  and government obligations 
the use of our cash flows for operations has primarily consisted of salaries and wages for our employees  facility and facility related costs for our office and laboratory  fees paid in connection with preclinical studies  
table of contents laboratory supplies  consulting fees  and legal fees 
in addition  during and through august   we incurred significant costs to fund our equal share of co development expenses for a basal cell carcinoma product candidate  which was under development with genentech 
our co development participation ended on august  and genentech will be solely responsible for all future costs and development decisions regarding the basal cell carcinoma program 
during the year ended december   we recorded  in contra revenues in our consolidated statement of operations in connection with these co development costs 
to date  the primary source of our cash flows from operations has been payments received from our collaborators and licensors 
in general  our only source of cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future will be up front license payments from new collaborations  payments for the achievement of milestones if any are met and funded research and development that we may receive under collaboration agreements 
except for five researchers that are funded by wyeth through february  and twelve researchers  including three outsourced chemists  that are funded by genentech through march   substantially all of our research staff is working on developing drug candidates from our targeted cancer drug development platform 
for the majority of our programs under existing collaborations  therefore  our future revenues are limited to the amortization of license fees and to revenues recognized for cash payments that are contingent upon the successful completion of contractually defined development  regulatory  and  in one case  product sales objectives 
the timing of or entrance into any new collaboration agreements and any payments under existing collaboration agreements cannot be easily predicted and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
we are not currently in any advanced negotiations with new or existing collaborators 
net cash used in operating activities was  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  cash used in operating activities during the years ended december  was primarily the result of our net loss for the period of  partially offset by non cash charges including stock based compensation of  and depreciation of  in addition  changes in certain operating assets and liabilities offset these increases in operating cash during year ended december  specifically  our accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased  primarily as a result of the cessation on august  of our co development arrangement with genentech and our deferred revenue decreased  as a result of license fee amortization under our various collaborations 
cash used in operating activities during the year ended december  was primarily the result of our net loss for the period of  partially offset by non cash charges of  including depreciation  stock based compensation  and non cash interest expense 
in addition  increases in operating cash resulted from changes in certain current assets and liabilities during the year ended december   including an increase in deferred revenue of  related to the receipt of license fees from our collaborators 
we received a  license fee under our april collaboration agreement  and a  license fee under our collaboration agreement with procter gamble 
in addition  we received  under a previously written off note receivable from a former collaborator 
we expect to continue to use cash in operations as we continue to research and develop certain of our existing product candidates and advance our targeted cancer drug development platform programs through preclinical development and  we expect  into clinical development 
in addition  in the future we may owe royalties and other contingent payments to our licensors based on the achievement of developmental milestones  product sales and specified other objectives 
we also expect that the increase in cash used will be partially offset by anticipated payments made under our collaborations with genentech through march  and wyeth through february   assuming these collaborations continue in accordance with their terms 
investing activities generated cash of  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  cash provided by investing activities resulted from  in net investment sales offset by  in fixed asset purchases for the year ended december  cash generated in investing activities resulted principally from  in net investment sales offset by  in fixed asset purchases for the year ended december  
table of contents financing activities used  of cash for the year ended december   resulting from debt repayments of  on our notes with the boston private bank trust company offset by proceeds of  received upon stock option exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
financing activities provided  for the year ended december   resulting from proceeds of  from the issuance of debt for the purchase of fixed assets and proceeds of  received upon stock option exercises 
these increases were offset by  in repayments of obligations under a note payable 
on march   we converted  financed under an amended loan agreement with the boston private bank trust company  into a month term note that bears interest at a fixed rate of for the repayment period 
under the terms of the note payable  we are required to make equal monthly payments of  plus any accrued interest beginning on may  extending through the month term 
this loan is collateralized by all of our property  plant and equipment assets  except for fixtures and those that are purchased after march  under purchase money arrangements with equipment lenders 
on december   we converted  financed under a separate loan agreement with the boston private bank trust company  into a month term note that bears interest at a fixed rate of for the repayment period 
under the terms of the note payable  we are required to make equal monthly payments of  plus any accrued interest beginning on january  extending through the month term 
this loan is collateralized by any equipment and leasehold improvements financed thereunder 
as of december   we were in compliance with the sole covenant under each of the agreements 
the covenant requires us to maintain a minimum working capital ratio 
should we fail to pay amounts when due or fail to maintain compliance with the covenant under the agreements  the entire obligation becomes immediately due at the option of the boston private bank trust company 
contractual obligations in addition to our loan agreement with boston private bank trust company  we also have contractual obligations including an operating lease related to our facilities  research services agreements  consulting agreements  and license agreements 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations due by the period indicated at december  amounts in s total less than one year one to three years more than three years debt obligations under note payable  including interest operating lease obligations outside service obligations licensing obligations total future obligations outside service obligations consist of agreements we have with outside labs  consultants and various other service organizations 
in the future  we may owe royalties and other contingent payments to our licensees based on the achievement of developmental milestones  product sales and specified other objectives 
these potential future obligations are not included in the above table 
we anticipate that existing capital resources at december   together with the payment of all contractually defined research funding payments but excluding any cash payments that are contingent upon the achievement of defined development objectives under our collaborations and research programs with genentech and wyeth  assuming these contracts are not earlier terminated  should enable us to maintain current and planned operations into the fourth quarter of we expect to incur substantial additional research and development and other costs  including costs related to preclinical studies and clinical trials  for the foreseeable future 
our ability 
table of contents to continue funding planned operations beyond the fourth quarter of is dependent upon the success of our collaborations  our ability to control our cash burn rate and our ability to raise additional funds through entering into additional corporate collaborations  equity or debt financings  or from other sources of financing 
our ability to generate sufficient cash flows depends on a number of factors  including the ability of either us  or our collaborators  to obtain regulatory approval to market and commercialize products to treat indications in major commercial markets 
we are seeking additional collaborative arrangements and also anticipate that we will seek to raise funds through one or more financing transactions  if conditions permit 
due to our significant long term capital requirements  we intend to seek to raise funds through the sale of debt or equity securities when conditions are favorable  even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at such time 
additional financing may not be available or  if available  it may not be available on favorable terms 
in addition  the sale of additional debt or equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
if substantial additional funding is not available  our ability to fund research and development and other operations will be significantly affected and  accordingly  our business will be materially and adversely affected 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  inflation we believe that inflation has not had a significant impact on our revenue and results of operations since inception

this dual approach includes both an income statement focused assessment and a balance sheet focused assessment 
the guidance in sab must be applied to annual financial statements for fiscal years ending after november  the adoption of sab did not effect our consolidated financial position for the year ended december  
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our cash balances in excess of operating requirements in cash equivalents and short term marketable securities  generally money market funds  corporate debt and government securities with an average maturity of less than one year 
all marketable securities are considered available for sale 
the primary objective of our cash investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our invested cash without significantly increasing risk of loss 
our marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
however  because of the short term nature of the marketable securities  we do not believe that interest rate fluctuations would materially impair the principal amount of our investments 
our investments are investment grade securities  and deposits are with investment grade financial institutions 
we believe that the realization of losses due to changes in credit spreads is unlikely as we have the ability to hold our investments for a sufficient period of time to recover the fair value of the investment and there is sufficient evidence to indicate that the fair value of the investment is recoverable 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we do not believe that a change in interest rate percentages would have a material impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio or our interest income 
as of december   we held euro and chinese yuan renminbi denominated assets on our balance sheet of  and  respectively 
the underlying assets are expected to have a holding period of one year or less 
the value of these assets could fluctuate based on changes in the exchange rate between the dollar and euro and the dollar and chinese yuan renminbi 
we have not entered into any hedging agreements relating to this risk 
we do not believe that a change in foreign currency exchange rates would have a material impact on the fair value of these assets or our net income loss
