the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and assumptions that affect the 
table of contents reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
these estimates are based on  but not limited to  historical results  industry standards and current economic conditions  giving due consideration to materiality 
the most significant assumptions and estimates relate to revenue recognition and the recoverability of trade accounts receivable  depreciable lives  valuation of real estate and realizability of deferred tax assets 
application of these assumptions requires the exercise of judgment as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable base rental revenues from rental property are recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the related leases 
certain of these leases also provide for percentage rents based upon the level of sales achieved by the lessee 
these percentage rents are recorded once the required sales level is achieved 
operating expense reimbursements are recognized as earned 
rental income may also include payments received in connection with lease termination agreements

expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
significant renovations and replacements  which improve and extend the life of the asset  are capitalized

 business combinations 
based on these estimates  the company allocates the purchase price to the applicable assets and liabilities 
the company utilizes methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities 
the useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are evaluated each reporting period with any changes in estimated useful lives being accounted for over the revised remaining useful life 
depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  as follows buildings to years fixtures  building and leasehold improvements including certain identified intangible assets terms of leases or useful lives  whichever is shorter the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis with respect to those properties 
these assessments have a direct impact on the company s net income 
real estate under development on the company s consolidated balance sheets represents ground up development of neighborhood and community shopping center projects which are subsequently sold upon completion and projects which the company may hold as long term investments

the company ceases cost capitalization when the property is held available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements  but no later than one year from the completion of major construction activity 
if  in management s opinion  the estimated net sales price of these assets is less than the net carrying value  an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property 
a gain on the sale of these assets is generally recognized using the full accrual method in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for real estate sales 

table of contents long lived assets on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the real estate properties including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities may be impaired 
a property value is considered impaired only if management s estimate of current and projected operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the property over its remaining useful life is less than the net carrying value of the property 
such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income  trends  and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other factors 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the carrying value of the property would be adjusted to an amount to reflect the estimated fair value of the property 
when a real estate asset is identified by management as held for sale  the company ceases depreciation of the asset and estimates the sales price of such asset net of selling costs 
if  in management s opinion  the net sales price of the asset is less than the net book value of such asset  an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property 
the company is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of its real estate properties  investments in joint ventures and other investments

the company accounts for its preferred equity investments under the equity method of accounting 
as of december   the company s net investment under the preferred equity program was approximately million relating to properties 
as of december   these preferred equity investment properties had individual non recourse mortgage loans aggregating approximately billion 
due to the company s preferred position in these investments  the company s pro rata share of each investment is subject to fluctuation and is dependent upon property cash flows 
the company s maximum exposure to losses associated with its preferred equity investments is primarily limited to its invested capital 
during june  the company acquired a equity participation interest in an existing leveraged lease of properties 
the properties are leased under a long term bond type net lease whose primary term expires in  with the lessee having certain renewal option rights 
the company s cash equity investment was approximately million 
this equity investment is reported as a net investment in leveraged lease in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases as amended 
the net investment in leveraged lease reflects the original cash investment adjusted by remaining net rentals  estimated unguaranteed residual value  unearned and deferred income  and deferred taxes relating to the investment 
as of december   of these properties were sold  whereby the proceeds from the sales were used to pay down the mortgage debt by approximately million 
as of 
table of contents december   the remaining properties were encumbered by third party non recourse debt of approximately million that is scheduled to fully amortize during the primary term of the lease from a portion of the periodic net rents receivable under the net lease 
as an equity participant in the leveraged lease  the company has no recourse obligation for principal or interest payments on the debt  which is collateralized by a first mortgage lien on the properties and collateral assignment of the lease 
accordingly  this debt has been offset against the related net rental receivable under the lease 
effects of inflation many of the company s leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants gross sales above pre determined thresholds  which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
such escalation clauses often include increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices 
in addition  many of the company s leases are for terms of less than years  which permits the company to seek to increase rents to market rates upon renewal 
most of the company s leases require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance costs  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
the company periodically evaluates its exposure to short term interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and will  from time to time  enter into interest rate protection agreements and or foreign currency hedge agreements which mitigate  but do not eliminate  the effect of changes in interest rates on its floating rate debt and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
