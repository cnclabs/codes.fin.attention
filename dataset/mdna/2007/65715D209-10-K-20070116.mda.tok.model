overview we manufacture  market and sell products for the radiation oncology community  including brachytherapy seeds and ancillary devices used primarily in the treatment of prostate cancer  as well as intensity modulated and image guidance radiation therapy products and services for localization and treatment of cancer 
our business is organized into two operating segments imrt igrt  and radiation sources 
imrt igrt develops and markets intensity modulated radiation therapy imrt and image guided radiation therapy igrt products used in the treatment of cancer 
radiation sources develops and markets radioisotopic products including brachytherapy seeds  accessories and calibration sources used in the treatment of cancer and in medical  environmental  research and industrial applications 
in october  we acquired theseus imaging corporation theseus  a company that had been engaged in the research and development of a proprietary radiopharmaceutical agent referred to as hynic annexin v 
over the following four years  we spent over million on clinical trials and additional research 
in july and august  we assessed the long term prospects of the theseus product candidate and confirmed our previous estimates that the successful completion of development and receipt of regulatory approvals of hynic annexin v would not occur earlier than and that the additional costs to achieve successful completion would be substantial 
with limited capital resources and the additional need to fund product development of our recently acquired imrt and igrt products  we decided to explore alternative options for theseus 
discussions with potential financial and strategic partners ceased in august as a direct result we shut down the operation in september in august  we acquired substantially all of the assets of radiation therapy products rtp  a manufacturer and distributor of equipment  including steppers and stabilizers  used in prostate brachytherapy procedures 
we added rtp to our brachytherapy product portfolio to provide a more complete product offering to customers and prospects 
on may   we acquired nomos corporation nomos  a privately held developer  manufacturer  and marketer of imrt and igrt products and services 
this acquisition was intended to significantly expand our product offerings to radiation oncologists 
under the terms of the agreement and plan of merger we paid approximately million consisting of million in cash  the issuance of million shares of the company s common stock with a fair value of approximately million  the assumption of million of stock options and warrants with a fair value of million  direct transaction costs of million and the assumption of acquisition related liabilities of million in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of nomos 
we manage this business as our imrt igrt operating segment 
our financial results include months of imrt igrt operating results in fiscal years and and months in fiscal on november   we announced the introduction of clearpath  our unique multicatheter breast brachytherapy device for accelerated partial breast irradiation apbi  at the american society for therapeutic radiology and oncology astro annual meeting in philadelphia 
the clearpath systems are placed through a single incision and are designed to conform to the resection cavity  allowing for more conformal therapeutic radiation dose distribution following lumpectomy compared to other methods of apbi 
clearpath is designed to accommodate either high dose  clearpath hdr  or low dose rate  clearpath cr  treatment methods 
the company received k approval from the united states food and drug administration for a low dose rate  or continuous release treatment utilizing the company s prospera brachytherapy seeds in april and approval for the high dose rate treatment in november we expect to commercially launch our clearpath product during fiscal year  with an initial focus on clearpath hdr  to be followed by release of our clearpath cr 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill and long lived asset impairments  loss contingencies  and taxes 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 
revenue recognition we sell products for the radiation oncology community  including brachytherapy seeds used in the treatment of cancer  as well as imrt and igrt products and services 
product revenue consists of brachytherapy  non therapeutic sources  and certain imrt hardware devices  including our mimic and crane products 
software revenues consist of imrt treatment planning software corvus  peregrine and peacock and our igrt products 
service revenue consists of warranty revenue and maintenance service agreements 
product revenue we apply the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition for the sale of non software products 
sab no 
which supercedes sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
sab no 
outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for the disclosure of revenue recognition policies 
in general  we recognize revenue related to product sales when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue recognition is deferred when undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of delivered products  customer acceptance is uncertain  significant obligations remain  or the fair value of undelivered elements is unknown or collectibility is uncertain 
software revenue our software revenue is generated from the sale of advanced medical equipment products 
the software element of our products is deemed an essential element of the functionality of the product 
maintenance and support are provided with the initial product sale for a twelve month period 
the maintenance and support is renewable annually or longer  at the customer s discretion 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by statement of position sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
under the provisions of sop  we recognize software revenue upon delivery and acceptance  provided all significant obligations have been met  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  fees are fixed or determinable  collection is probable  and we are not involved in providing services that are essential to the functionality of the product 
our software sales are generally multiple element arrangements  which could include the product  first year annual maintenance and support  and training and installation 
revenues from the multiple element arrangements are allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of the elements 
if the fair value of the element exists  the determination is based on vendor specific objective evidence 
if such evidence of fair value for each element of the arrangement does not exist  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time that evidence of fair value of each element does exist or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered 
if in a multiple element arrangement  fair value does not exist for one or more of the undelivered elements  the residual method of accounting is applied 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred  and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
service revenue service revenues are derived mainly from maintenance and support contracts and are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
payments for maintenance revenues are normally received in advance and are nonrefundable 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable 
we regularly review the allowance by considering factors such as historical experience  age of the accounts receivable balances and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
if there were a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be overstated which could have an adverse impact on our financial results 
a reserve for sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates and is recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable 
if the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established  our revenue could be adversely affected 
to date  product returns have not been considered material to our results of operations 
inventory reserves inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined under the first in  first out method 
costs include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
the company s radiation sources products are subject to shelf life expiration periods  which are carefully monitored by the company 
provision is made for inventory items which may not be sold because of expiring dates 
the company routinely reviews other inventories for evidence of impairment of value and makes provision as such impairments are identified 
goodwill our methodology for allocating the purchase price related to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques 
goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less assumed liabilities 
we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
in response to changes in industry and market conditions  we may strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring  disposing of  or otherwise exiting businesses  which could result in an impairment of goodwill 
impairment of long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets  which include equipment and leasehold improvements and identifiable intangible assets  whenever events and circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
in the event the expected undiscounted future cash flow attributable to the asset is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value is recorded 
the company engaged an appraisal firm to perform an analysis of the goodwill and intangible assets acquired from nomos corporation on may  to determine the fair value thereof under sfas and sfas as of the company s annual test date of september  the company s management and audit committee of the board reviewed and agreed with the appraisal firm s conclusions that the nomos goodwill and intangible assets were impaired  due to negative operating performance indicators of our imrt igrt business  including three successive years of declining sales and continued net operating losses 
as a result  the company wrote down the nomos goodwill and intangible assets to their fair value in the quarter ended october   as follows sept 
 carrying value sept 
 fair value impairment nomos goodwill    nomos intangible assets    total in addition  the company performed an internal analysis under sfas and sfas as of the company s annual test date of september  of the goodwill and intangible assets acquired from radiation therapy products rtp in august  to determine the fair value thereof under the applicable standards 
the company concluded that the goodwill and intangible assets acquired from rtp were impaired due to negative operating performance indicators  including the rtp products lower sales and net operating losses 
as a result  the company wrote down the rtp goodwill by  and the rtp intangible assets by  to their fair value in the quarter ended october  the company engaged an appraisal firm to perform an analysis of the goodwill and intangible assets acquired from nomos corporation on may  to determine the fair value thereof under sfas and sfas as of the company s annual test date of september  as a result of this testing  the company determined there was no impairment of its goodwill and intangible assets in fiscal year loss contingencies we record liabilities related to pending litigation when an unfavorable outcome is probable and we can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss 
we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims  either asserted or unasserted  that arise in the ordinary course of business 
we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and an estimate of the amount of the loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of the probability and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated 
when we determine that it is probable that a loss has been incurred  the effect is recorded promptly in the consolidated financial statements 
although the outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty  we do not believe that any of the existing legal matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
income taxes we utilize sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
deferred taxes are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
in addition  we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations 
stock based compensation effective november   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors  including stock options and employee stock purchases related to the company s employee stock purchase plan the employee stock purchase plan  based on their fair values 
sfas r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  which we previously followed in accounting for stock based awards 
in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab to provide guidance on sfas r 
the company has applied sab in its adoption of sfas r 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method as of and for the fiscal year ended october  in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  the company s financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas r 
share based compensation expense recognized is based on the value of the portion of share based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest 
share based compensation expense recognized in the company s condensed consolidated statement of operations during the fiscal year ended october  includes compensation expense for share based payment awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  october  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of sfas and new stock option grants made during the fiscal year ended october  a total of  stock option grants were awarded to employees on march  and a total of  stock option grants were awarded to directors on may  and june  results of operations fiscal vs 
fiscal total revenue year ended october  change millions imrt igrt products imrt igrt services total imrt igrt radiation sources total revenue decreased million  or  to million for the year ended october  from million for the year ended october  the decrease in revenue is due to a million decline in product and service revenues from our imrt igrt business segment acquired in the purchase of nomos in may  partially offset by a million increase of net sales in our radiation sources business 
the decrease in the imrt igrt revenue results from a decline in both the number of products sold and in average selling prices due to competition 
the increase in our radiation sources business reflects a increase in sales of our brachytherapy seeds due to increased shipments of brachytherapy seeds  partially offset by a decline in average selling prices due to competition  and a increase in sales of our non therapeutic products 
our service revenue is related to our imrt igrt business  and decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended october  from million for the fiscal year ended october  gross profit year ended october  change millions imrt igrt products imrt igrt services total imrt igrt radiation sources year ended october  point change of revenue imrt igrt products imrt igrt services total imrt igrt radiation sources gross profit decreased million  or  to million for the year ended october  from million for the fiscal year ended october  the decrease in our gross profit is primarily due to reduced revenues of our imrt igrt business and the start up costs of in house seed stranding of our radiation sources business 
gross profit for fiscal year consisted of million from our imrt igrt business and million from our radiation sources business 
the gross profit on our service revenue related to our imrt igrt business decreased million  or  to million for the full year ended october  from million for the fiscal year ended october  gross profit as a percent of sales decreased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year primarily due to the decline in product and service revenue in our imrt igrt business in fiscal compared to fiscal gross profit as a percent of sales by business segment for fiscal year consisted of of sales from our imrt igrt business and of sales from our radiation sources business 
the gross profit as a percent of sales of our imrt igrt business was impacted by an increase in the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory of million  or of sales 
we anticipate that gross profit margins of both businesses will improve over time with the anticipated increase in sales volumes as new products are introduced 
selling expenses year ended october  change millions selling expenses as a percent of total revenue selling expenses comprised primarily of salaries  commissions  and marketing costs  decreased million or  to million for the fiscal year ended october   from million for the fiscal year ended october  the decrease in selling expenses is primarily attributed to reduced sales commissions related to the decline in sales of imrt igrt products 
general and administrative expenses g a year ended october  change millions general and administrative expenses as a percent of total revenue g a increased million or  to million for the fiscal year ended october   from million for the fiscal year ended october  the increase in g a is primarily attributed to million of stock compensation expense as a result of the implementation of sfas r which requires the expensing of stock options  and in litigation related legal fees  partially offset by a reduction in personnel expenses 
research and development r d year ended october  change millions research and development expenses as a percent of total revenue r d decreased million or  to million for the fiscal year ended october   from million for the fiscal year ended october  the decrease in r d spending is primarily due to reduced project spending in imrt igrt business  partially offset by increased spending on product development in our radiation sources business relating to in house stranding and breast brachytherapy 
our r d spending reflects our belief that to maintain our competitive position in a market characterized by rapid rates of technological advancement  we must continue to invest significant resources in new product development  as well as continue to enhance existing products 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets decreased by million to million for the fiscal year ended october  from million for the fiscal year ended october  the decrease is attributed to the write down of certain intangible assets in the fourth quarter of interest and other income  net 
interest expense was million for the fiscal year ended october   compared to interest income of million for the fiscal year ended october  the interest expense in fiscal resulted from the short term and long term debt and amortization of warrants  and the interest income in fiscal was due to a portfolio of marketable securities 
gain from discontinued operation 
a gain of million was recorded on the discontinued theseus operation for the fiscal year ended october  compared to a gain of million for the fiscal year ended october  the gain in both fiscal years resulted from actual shut down expenses that were below estimated expenses that we had previously accrued 
fiscal vs 
fiscal total revenue year ended october  change millions imrt igrt products imrt igrt services total imrt igrt radiation sources total revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended october  from million for the year ended october  the increase in revenue is attributed an additional million of revenue from our imrt igrt business segment acquired in the purchase of nomos in may  reflecting a full year s results from that business segment  offset by a million decrease of net sales in our radiation sources business

see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impairment charge 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net decreased million  or to million for the fiscal year ended october  from million for the fiscal year ended october  this decrease reflects lower interest income as a result of a reduced portfolio of marketable securities in fiscal provision benefit for income taxes

gain from discontinued operation 
a gain of million was recorded on the discontinued theseus operation for the fiscal year ended october  compared to a loss of million for the fiscal year ended october  the gain in fiscal year resulted from actual shut down expenses that were below estimated expenses that we had previously accrued 
liquidity and capital resources to date  our short term liquidity needs have generally consisted of working capital to fund our ongoing operations and to finance growth in inventories  trade accounts receivable  new product research and development  capital expenditures  acquisitions and strategic investments in related businesses 
we have satisfied these needs primarily through a combination of cash generated by operations  bank lines of credit  public offerings and from private placements of our common stock 
we expect that we will be able to satisfy our longer term liquidity needs for research and development  capital expenditures  and acquisitions through a combination of cash generated by operations  public offerings and private placements of our common stock  debt  and bank lines of credit 
the accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business 
we have incurred net losses of million  million  and million for the years ended october   and  respectively  and have used cash in operations of million  million  and million for the years ended october  and  respectively 
as of october   we had an accumulated deficit of million  cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  and no debt or other borrowings 
based on our current operating plans  we believe that the existing cash resources  cash forecasted by our plans to be generated by operations  the issuance of our common stock and or debt as well as our anticipated available bank lines of credit will be sufficient to meet working capital and capital requirements through at least the next twelve months 
also  our plans to attain profitability and generate additional cash flows include increasing revenues from existing and new products and services and a focus on cost control 
however  there is no assurance that we will be successful with these plans 
if events and circumstances occur such that we do not meet our current operating plan as expected  and we are unable to raise additional debt or equity financing  we may be required to further reduce expenses or take other steps which could have a material adverse effect on our future performance  including but not limited to  the premature sale of some or all of our assets or product lines on undesirable terms  merger with or acquisition by another company on unsatisfactory terms  or the cessation of operations 
the following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheets  cash flows  and commitments on our liquidity and capital resources 
balance sheet and cash flows cash  cash equivalents  and investments in marketable securities 
at october   we had cash and cash equivalents  and investments in marketable securities aggregating approximately million  an increase of approximately million from million at october  the increase was primarily attributed to million in net proceeds from the private placement of our common stock and warrants  million in cash received from the exercise of stock options and the employee stock purchase plan  partially offset by million used in continuing operating activities  million used in discontinued theseus operations  and million used for capital expenditures 
we expect that cash used in operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors  including fluctuations in our operating results  accounts receivable collections  inventory management  research and development expenses  and the timing of payments 
during the year ended october   we received million from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares related to our employee stock purchase plan 
proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the employee stock purchase plan will vary from period to period based upon  among other factors  fluctuations in the market value of our stock relative to the exercise price of such options 
the primary objectives for our investment portfolio are liquidity and safety of principal 
investments are made to achieve the highest rate of return  consistent with these two objectives 
we invest excess cash in securities with varying maturities to meet projected cash needs 
equipment and leasehold improvements 
equipment and leasehold improvements fixed assets decreased approximately million to million at october   from million at october  the decrease in fixed assets reflects capital expenditures of million offset by million in depreciation expense 
accounts payable and accrued expenses 
accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased approximately million to million as of october   from million at october   primarily due to a reduction in accrued expenses 
deferred revenue 
deferred revenue decreased approximately million as of october  from october  the decrease was attributable to a reduction in the sales of products and services in our imrt igrt business 
deferred revenue consists of unearned service revenue and the deferral of software product revenue where customer acceptance has not been received or for new products where acceptance by our customers has not been clearly established 
liquidity and capital resource requirements we have operating lease obligations for facilities and equipment under non cancelable operating lease agreements 
future minimum lease payments are subject to annual adjustment for increases in the consumer price index 
we also have purchase commitments to suppliers under blanket purchase orders 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases purchase commitments based on our current operating plans  we believe that the existing cash resources  cash forecasted by our plans to be generated by operations  and our anticipated available bank lines of credit will be sufficient to meet working capital and capital requirements through at least the next twelve months 
however  the amount of capital that we will need in the future will depend on many factors including our future operating results  levels of sales and marketing that will be required to launch future products and achieve and maintain a competitive position in the marketplace for both existing and new products  market acceptance of our products  levels of inventory and accounts receivable that we maintain  competitors responses to our products  level of capital expenditures  and acquisition or development of other businesses  technologies or products 
if we should require additional financing due to continued operating losses or other unanticipated developments  additional financing may not be available when needed or  if available  we may not be able to obtain this financing on favorable terms 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  dilution to existing stockholders would result 
insufficient funds may require us to further reduce expenses or take other steps which could have a material adverse effect on our future performance  including but not limited to  the premature sale of some or all of our assets or product lines on undesirable terms  merger with or acquisition by another company on unsatisfactory terms  or the cessation of operations
