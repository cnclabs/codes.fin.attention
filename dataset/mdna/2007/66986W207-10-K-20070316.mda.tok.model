item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our growth strategy surgical facilities we are focused on acquiring  developing and operating ascs 
historically  our emphasis was primarily on eye surgical services 
over the past three years  however  we have expanded into other specialties such as orthopedics including podiatry  urology  gastroenterology  pain management  plastic surgery and gynecology 
this expansion into other specialties has been through both the acquisition of new facilities and the addition of specialties to our existing centers 
while ophthalmology is still our largest specialty and a key part of our growth strategy  we are actively evaluating and pursuing opportunities in other specialties 
the key elements of our growth strategy are increasing the revenue and profitability of our existing ascs  acquiring equity interests in ascs in partnership with physicians  and developing newly constructed ascs through joint ownership arrangements with physicians 
increasing revenue and profitability of our existing ascs the revenue generated by our ascs is driven by the surgical procedures performed by physicians 
revenue growth in our existing ascs is expected to be derived from an increase in surgical procedures performed at each facility  whether this increase is from the existing physicians or new physicians utilizing the facility 
all of our ascs currently have the capacity to handle additional procedures 
given this capacity  we introduce the benefits of our facilities to new physicians who may be using other less efficient and convenient facilities 
we believe the efficiency and convenience of an asc  and the opportunity to work in facilities affiliated with a national asc operator with significant management expertise  are appealing to physicians and their patients and provides a more attractive setting than hospitals 
we employ sales people in several of our markets who are working on a full time basis to market our ascs to potential physicians 
we also work with our physicians to identify new procedures  technologies or equipment to integrate into our facilities and expand the scope of surgical services offered in a cost effective manner 
moreover  as we continue to expand the number of multi specialty ascs within our portfolio  reimbursements from private third party payors will likely increase as an overall percentage of our surgical facility revenue 
thus  we will continue to evaluate opportunities to maximize our managed care panel participation and reimbursement levels 
with some of our existing centers that currently provide only eye related surgical services  we are exploring efficient ways to add new surgical specialties 
we are often required to obtain state licensure approval to add other specialties to our existing centers 
the likelihood of our success in receiving these approvals will vary by state 
staffing and medical supply costs are generally an asc s two largest expense categories 
we analyze staffing schedules and work with physicians to schedule surgeries in a manner that maximizes staff efficiency and optimizes staffing costs 
we also have negotiated purchasing contracts with many of our largest vendors and we educate our physicians on lower cost supply alternatives that still maintain high patient care standards 
acquiring equity interests in ascs we have a development staff that is responsible for identifying  evaluating and negotiating the acquisition of majority interests in ascs in new or existing markets 
in certain instances  we may also consider acquiring a minority  rather than a majority  equity interest 
the acquisition of a well established asc is an attractive means of entry into a new market  particularly in states that require a certificate of need con for development 
in analyzing potential transactions  the evaluation of our prospective physician partners is a critical factor 
we recognize that the success of our ascs is tied directly to the success of our physician partners and their practices 
we believe our management services experience greatly enhances our physician evaluation process 
we also assess the target facility s potential for future growth 
we identify opportunities to add new physicians or surgical procedures  or to improve managed care participation 
we also examine the opportunities to reduce expenses through improved staff efficiency  better physician scheduling and reduced supply costs 
our development staff and operations personnel work closely with our physician partners to formulate a growth strategy for each newly acquired facility to maximize our return on investment 
we currently intend to finance our future acquisitions of equity interests in ascs using cash generated from our operations and amounts borrowed under our credit facility 
our million credit facility expires on february  developing newly constructed ascs our development staff is also responsible for identifying potential opportunities to build new ascs with physician partners 
these projects involve partnering with one or more physicians in a local community that is either underserved from a facility standpoint  or involve physicians who don t have the resources  productivity or expertise to construct a facility on their own and seek an experienced partner to help finance  structure and oversee the project 
generally  development of a new asc can be an attractive alternative in states that do not require a con to build a new center 
we have developed two of our ascs as of march  product sales we believe there are opportunities to grow our optical products and services business by adding ophthalmologists and optometrists as customers  as well as offering a broader range of products and services to our existing customer base 
our marketing products and services business has grown recently due  in part  to more marketing dollars being spent by its customers to promote the new refractive intraocular lens technology 
competition surgical facilities in acquiring  developing and operating our ascs  our principal competitors are corporations  physicians and hospitals 
there are several publicly held and private companies actively engaged in the acquisition  development and operation of ascs 
some of these companies may acquire and develop multi specialty ascs  practice based ascs focusing on varying specialties  or a combination of the two 
moreover  some of these companies have the acquisition and development of ascs as their core business  while other competitors are larger  publicly held companies that have subsidiaries or divisions engaged in this business 
many of these competitors have greater resources than us 
in each of our local markets  we also compete with hospitals and other ascs in attracting physicians to utilize our ascs  for patients and for managed care contracting opportunities 
product sales our two optical laboratories face a variety of national  regional and local competitors 
we compete in the optical laboratory market on the bases of quality and breadth of service  reputation and price 
in the market for providing optical group purchasing services  we primarily compete with national and regional buying groups  as well as large vendors 
competition in this market is based upon service  price and the strength of the purchasing organization  including the ability to negotiate discounts with suppliers 
other our management services are provided to eye care professionals through long term affiliations 
the market for these management services is fragmented  and we do not face any single  dominant us national competitor 
eye care professionals may seek a corporate partner to assist them in the growth and development of their practices  as well as with the day to day management and administration of their businesses 
factors that may influence an eye care professional s decision to retain a corporate partner to provide management services are the corporate partner s experience and scope and quality of services offered  the eye care professional s need for these services  and price 
employees as of march   we had approximately employees  of whom are full time employees 
we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and we consider our relations with our employees to be good 
many of our ascs are located adjacent to a physician practice 
in some instances  our ascs may lease from the physician practice some or all of the individuals who provide services in the asc on our behalf 
this is typically only done when the asc may provide surgical services on a limited schedule 
this leasing model allows us to staff these centers in a more cost effective manner 
governmental regulation as a participant in the health care industry  our operations are subject to extensive and increasing regulation by governmental entities at the federal  state and local levels 
many of these laws and regulations are subject to varying interpretations  and we believe courts and regulatory authorities generally have provided little clarification 
moreover  state and local laws and interpretations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
as a result  we may not always be able to accurately predict interpretations of applicable law regulating our businesses 
we believe our business practices comply in all material respects with applicable federal  state and local laws and regulations 
if the legal compliance of any of our activities were challenged  however  we might have to divert substantial time  attention and resources from running our business to defend against these challenges regardless of their merit 
in such circumstances  if we do not successfully defend these challenges  we might face a variety of adverse consequences including losing our asc licenses  losing our eligibility to participate in medicare  medicaid or other federal or state health care programs  or losing other contracting privileges and  in some instances  civil or criminal fines 
any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the regulatory environment in which we operate may change significantly in the future 
numerous legislative proposals have been introduced in the us congress and in various state legislatures over the past several years that could cause major reforms of the us health care system 
in addition  several sets of regulations have been recently adopted that may require substantial changes in the way health care providers operate during the coming years 
in response to new or revised laws  regulations or interpretations  we could be required to revise the structure of our legal arrangements  repurchase minority equity interests in our ascs that are owned by physicians  incur substantial legal fees  fines or other costs  or curtail our business activities  reducing the potential profit to us of some of our legal arrangements  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the following is a summary of the principal health care regulatory issues affecting our operations and us 
federal law anti kickback statute 
the federal anti kickback statute prohibits the knowing and willful solicitation  receipt  offer or payment of any direct or indirect remuneration in return for the referral of patients or the ordering or purchasing of items or services payable under medicare  medicaid or other federal health care programs 
violations of this statute may result in criminal penalties  including imprisonment or criminal fines of up to  per violation  civil penalties of up to  per violation plus up to three times the amount of the underlying remuneration  and exclusion from federal or state programs including medicare or medicaid 
the anti kickback statute is broadly written as to encompass many legitimate  harmless and pro competitive arrangements 
consequently  congress has enacted a series of statutory exceptions to the anti kickback statute  and the inspector general for the us department of health and human services dhhs has promulgated a series of regulatory safe harbors 
when possible  we have attempted to structure our business operations within a safe harbor 
however  some aspects of our business either do not meet the prescribed safe harbor standards  or relate to practices for which no safe harbor standards exist 
because there is no legal requirement that relationships fit within a safe harbor  a business arrangement that does not comply with the relevant safe harbor  or for which a safe harbor does not exist  does not necessarily violate the anti kickback statute  and is not necessarily illegal per se 
included among the safe harbors to the anti kickback statute are certain safe harbors for investment interests in general  and for investment interests in ascs  specifically 
as of march   we co own of our ascs with one or more physicians  and we will likely co own with physicians most of the ascs that we will acquire in the future 
we will also likely be selling minority interests in our existing wholly owned ascs to physicians in the near to intermediate term 
it is unlikely that our co ownership will meet all of the parameters of the general investment interest safe harbors or the asc investment interest safe harbors 
as discussed above  however  an arrangement that does not fit squarely within a safe harbor is not per se unlawful under the anti kickback statute 
it is our intent to structure all such co ownership arrangements in a manner that complies with as many of the safe harbor components as possible  that meets the objectives of the anti kickback statute  and that follows the other available regulatory guidance regarding asc co ownership arrangements to the greatest extent possible 
the applicable regulatory authorities have provided limited guidance regarding asc ownership arrangements that are permissible under the anti kickback statute 
based on the guidance that is available  we believe that our joint ownership arrangements comply with the anti kickback law based on  among other things  the following factors all of the jointly owned ascs are medicare certified  patients referred to an asc by an investor are informed of the referring physician s investment interest in the asc  the terms on which an investment interest in the asc is offered to an investor are not related to the previous or expected volume of referrals or services by  or other business with  the investor  neither any of the investors including us nor the asc entity will loan money to any investors or guarantee debt of any investors incurred to purchase the investment interest  the return on investment in the asc is directly proportional to the investors investment interests  the ascs treat federal health program beneficiaries in a non discriminatory manner  and medicare recognized surgical procedures account for a significant portion of the investor physicians medical practice income 
self referral law 
subject to limited exceptions  the federal self referral law  known as the stark law  prohibits physicians and optometrists from referring their medicare or medicaid patients for the provision of designated health services to any entity with which they or their immediate family members have a financial relationship 
financial relationships include both compensation and ownership relationships 
designated health services include clinical laboratory services  radiology and ultrasound services  durable medical equipment and supplies  and prosthetics  orthotics and prosthetic devices  as well as seven other categories of services 
generally speaking  the stark law does not prohibit referrals to ascs from physicians with ownership or investment interests in those ascs 
medicare regulations provide two exceptions that protect referrals to ascs by physicians who have ownership or compensation relationships with those ascs 
the first exception expressly exempts items and services which are identified as designated health services for which payment is included in the asc composite rate 
referrals made for these items and services by physicians with a financial relationship do not violate the stark law when furnished in the asc setting 
thus  when an intraocular lens  or iol  used in cataract surgery  or another service or item that would otherwise qualify as a designated health service  is included in an asc composite payment rate  the iol or other such service or item will not be considered to be a designated health service 
the second exception provides that prosthetics  prosthetic devices  and durable medical equipment implanted at a medicare certified asc by the referring physician or a member of the referring physician s group practice also are specially excepted  even when the medicare payment for these items is separate from ie  not bundled into the asc payment 
violating the stark law may result in denial of payment for the designated health services performed  civil fines of up to  for each service provided pursuant to a prohibited referral  a fine of up to  for participation in a circumvention scheme  and exclusion from the medicare  medicaid and other federal health care programs 
the stark law is a strict liability statute 
any referral made where a financial relationship exists that fails to meet an exception constitutes a violation of the law 
civil false claims act 
the federal civil false claims act prohibits knowingly presenting or causing to be presented any false or fraudulent claim for payment by the government  or using any false or fraudulent record in order to have a false or fraudulent claim paid 
violations of the law may result in repayment of three times the damages suffered by the government and penalties from  to  per false claim 
collateral consequences of a violation of the false claims act include administrative penalties and possible exclusion from participation in medicare  medicaid and other federal health care programs 
health insurance portability and accountability act 
in august  congress enacted the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa 
included within hipaa s health care reform provisions are its administrative simplification provisions  which require that health care transactions be conducted in a standardized format  and that the privacy and security of certain individually identifiable health information be protected 
final rules for most of the administrative simplification subject areas have been published 
final rules covering standards for electronic transactions and code sets were published on august   and set forth the standardized billing codes and formats that we must use when conducting certain health care transactions and activities 
our ascs are utilizing standard transactions and approved code sets  all in compliance with hipaa 
on december   as modified on may  and august   the dhhs published final rules addressing standards for privacy of individually identifiable health information under hipaa s administrative simplification provisions 
compliance with these rules was required by april  these rules create substantial compliance issues for all covered entities which include health care providers  health plans and health care clearinghouses that engage in regulated transactions and activities 
operations of our ascs are covered by the final rules 
we believe our ascs are in substantial compliance with these final rules 
final rules addressing the security standards under hipaa s administrative simplification provisions were published on february  compliance with these regulations was required by april  we believe our ascs are in compliance 
violations of hipaa s administrative simplification provisions can result in civil penalties of up to  per person per year for each violation or criminal penalties of up to  and or up to years in prison per violation 
state law facility licensure and certificate of need 
we are required to obtain and maintain licenses from the state departments of health in states where we open  acquire and operate ascs 
we believe that we have obtained  and that we maintain  the necessary licenses in states where licenses are required 
with respect to future expansion  we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the required licenses without unreasonable expense or delay 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain licenses for all of our operating ascs 
we believe our ascs are in compliance with all applicable state licensure requirements  but we cannot guaranty that the state departments of health will continue to view our facilities as being in compliance 
some states require a certificate of need  or con  prior to the construction or modification of an asc or the purchase of specified medical equipment in excess of a dollar amount set by the state 
we believe that we have obtained the necessary cons in states where a con is required 
however  we believe courts and state regulatory authorities generally have provided little clarification as to some of the regulations governing the need for cons 
it is possible that a state regulatory authority could challenge our determination 
with respect to our future development of new ascs or expansion of existing ascs  we cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire a con in all states where a con is required 
anti kickback laws 
in addition to the federal anti kickback law  a number of states have enacted laws that prohibit payment for referrals and other types of kickback arrangements 
some of these state laws apply to all patients regardless of their source of payment  while others limit their scope to patients whose care is paid for by particular payors 
self referral laws 
in addition to the federal stark law  a number of states have enacted laws that require disclosure of or prohibit referrals by health care providers to entities in which the providers have an investment interest or with which the providers have a compensation relationship 
in some states  these restrictions apply regardless of the patient s source of payment 
state privacy laws 
numerous states have enacted privacy laws that have similar objectives to the federal hipaa privacy regulations 
these laws  which vary from state to state  require that certain protective measures be taken in connection with the disclosure of a patient s identifying information 
corporate practice of medicine 
a number of states have enacted laws that prohibit  or have common law that prohibits  the corporate practice of medicine 
these laws are designed to prevent interference in the medical decision making process by anyone who is not a licensed physician 
application of the corporate practice of medicine prohibition varies from state to state 
although we neither employ physicians nor provide professional medical services  we provide services to physicians in connection with their performance of surgical procedures through laser services agreements and through our remaining management services agreements 
to the extent any act or service to be performed by us is construed by a court or enforcement agency to constitute the practice of medicine  we cannot be sure that a particular state court or enforcement agency may not construe our arrangements as violating that jurisdiction s corporate practice of medicine doctrine 
in such an event  we may be required to redesign or reformulate our relationships with these eye care professionals and there is a possibility that some provisions of our agreements may not be enforceable 
fee splitting laws 
the laws of some states prohibit providers from dividing with anyone  other than providers who are part of the same group practice  any fee  commission  rebate or other form of compensation for any services not actually and personally rendered 
penalties for violating these fee splitting statutes or regulations may include revocation  suspension or probation of a provider s license  or other disciplinary action 
in addition  courts have refused to enforce contracts found to violate state fee splitting prohibitions 
the precise language and judicial interpretation of fee splitting prohibitions varies from state to state 
courts in some states have interpreted fee splitting statutes to prohibit all percentage of gross revenue and percentage of net profit management fee arrangements 
other state statutes only prohibit fee splitting in return for referrals 
to the extent any of our contractual arrangements are construed by a court or enforcement agency to violate the jurisdiction s fee splitting laws  we may be required to redesign or reformulate our arrangements and there is a possibility that some provisions of our agreements may not be enforceable 
excimer laser regulation medical devices  including the excimer lasers used in our ascs  are subject to regulation by the fda 
medical devices may not be marketed for commercial sale in the us until the fda grants pre market approval for the device 
failure to comply with applicable fda requirements could subject us or laser manufacturers to enforcement action  product seizures  recalls  withdrawal of approvals and civil and criminal penalties 
further  failure to comply with regulatory requirements  or any adverse regulatory action  could result in a limitation on or prohibition of our use of excimer lasers 
government regulation management services our management services business and the operations of our affiliated providers are also subject to extensive and continuing regulation by governmental entities at the federal  state and local levels 
the following is a summary of the principal health care regulatory issues affecting our management services business  both with respect to our affiliated providers and us federal law anti kickback statute 
as discussed above  there are safe harbor regulations to the federal anti kickback statute 
when possible  we have attempted to structure our management services business and our relationships with our affiliated providers within a safe harbor 
some aspects of our management services business  the business of our affiliated providers  and our relationships with our affiliated providers either do not meet the prescribed safe harbor standards  or relate to practices for which no safe harbor standards exist 
because there is no legal requirement that relationships fit within a safe harbor  a business arrangement that does not comply with the relevant safe harbor  or for which a safe harbor does not exist  does not necessarily violate the anti kickback statute 
self referral law 
our affiliated providers provide limited categories of designated health services  specifically  diagnostic radiology services  including a scans and b scans  and prosthetic devices  including eyeglasses and contact lenses furnished to patients following cataract surgery 
we believe the provision of these designated health services satisfies an exception to the stark law 
in addition  compensation arrangements between our affiliated providers and their employers have historically been structured to comply with the stark law 
civil false claims act 
the federal civil false claims act prohibits knowingly presenting or causing to be presented any false or fraudulent claim for payment by the government  or using any false or fraudulent record in order to have a false or fraudulent claim paid 
health insurance portability and accountability act 
the operations of our affiliated providers are covered by hipaa 
we have taken actions to assist our remaining affiliated providers with their hipaa compliance efforts 
state law state privacy laws 
state health information privacy laws may also apply to the activities of our affiliated providers 
there is very little guidance regarding the application of these state privacy laws 
we cannot be sure that the privacy measures taken by our affiliated providers will be construed as complying with these laws 
in the event the privacy measures taken by these professionals are deemed not to comply with a particular state s health privacy laws  we may need to incur significant time  effort and expense to establish compliance 
corporate practice of medicine laws 
although we neither employ doctors nor provide professional medical services  to the extent any portion of the comprehensive management services that we provide under our service agreements with our affiliated providers is construed by a court or enforcement agency to constitute the practice of medicine  our service agreements provide that our obligations to perform the act or service is waived 
we cannot be sure that a particular state court or enforcement agency may not construe our arrangements as violating that jurisdiction s corporate practice of medicine doctrine 
in such an event  we may be required to redesign or reformulate our relationships with our affiliated providers and there is a possibility that some provisions of our service agreements may not be enforceable 
fee splitting laws 
we believe our management fee arrangements with our affiliated providers differ from those invalidated as unlawful fee splits because they establish a flat monthly fee that is subject to adjustment based on the degree to which actual practice revenues or expenses vary from budget 
however  there is some risk that our arrangements could be construed by a state court or enforcement agency to run afoul of state fee splitting prohibitions 
accordingly  all of our service agreements contain either a reformation provision or a mechanism establishing an alternative fee structure  or both 
discontinued operations effective november   we sold our interest in our st 
joseph  mo asc to our existing physician partners 
we sold our interest due to state licensure issues unique to this asc as well as its limited growth potential 
the results of this asc are classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
in october  we announced our intentions to discontinue our management services business and beginning in the third quarter of  we reflected the management services business as discontinued operations in our financial statements 
we completed our discontinued operations plan in december when we consummated our last divestiture transaction 
from december to december  we negotiated and closed nineteen divestiture transactions 
after failing to find a buyer for two of our practices on terms acceptable to us  we subsequently decided to retain these practices 
these two practices are reported in continuing operations for all periods presented 
item a 
risk factors the following factors should be considered in evaluating our company and our business 
these factors may have a significant impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
risks relating to our business reduced prices and reimbursement rates for surgical procedures as a result of competition or medicare and other governmental and private third party payor cost containment efforts could reduce our revenue  profitability and cash flow government sponsored health care programs accounted for approximately of our consolidated net revenue for the year ended december  the health care industry is continuing to experience a trend toward cost containment as government and private third party payors seek to contain reimbursement and utilization rates and to negotiate reduced payment schedules with health care providers 
these trends may result in a reduction from historical levels in per patient revenue received by our ascs 
changes in medicare payment rates have  in the past  resulted in reduced payments to ascs 
medicaid and other governmental and private insurance payments also could be affected to the extent that these insurance companies use payment methodologies based on medicare rates  or take actions independent of medicare to revise payment methodologies 
on december   the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of referred to as the medicare modernization act was signed into law 
the medicare modernization act eliminates the historical practice of basing asc facility fees on cost surveys of ascs  and instead requires the centers for medicare medicaid services cms to devise a new methodology for establishing asc facility payments  and to implement new reimbursement rates based on the new methodology between january  and january  on august   cms proposed a new rate setting methodology pursuant to the mandate established under the medicare modernization act 
under the rate setting methodology proposed by cms  asc facility payments would be a percentage proposed to be percent of the rates paid to hospitals for the same services when furnished on an outpatient basis in the hospital setting 
payments for certain services commonly furnished in a physician offices would be capped at the amount medicare pays physicians as a technical component when the services are furnished in the office setting 
in the proposal  cms also announced its intent to implement the new payment system effective for services furnished on and after january  when cms eventually implements rebased rates  payment amounts for most procedures could change  in some cases significantly 
additionally  the medicare modernization act provides that there shall be no inflation update to medicare asc rates during calendar years through this freeze will adversely affect the revenues of our business 
further  if cms finalizes its proposal to base asc payments on amounts paid to hospitals for comparable services  we anticipate significant fluctuation in asc payment rates from year to year when cms annually updates hospital payment rates 
the proposed rule  as written  would result in a reduction in the reimbursement rates for certain ophthalmology procedures  including cataract and yag procedures  which made up approximately of the procedures performed in our ascs in the fourth quarter of the proposed rule also would reduce reimbursement rates for gastroenterology and pain procedures which together made up approximately of the procedures performed in our ascs in the fourth quarter of conversely  the proposed rule would increase reimbursement rates for certain procedures  including orthopedic procedures  which made up approximately of the total procedures performed in our ascs in the fourth quarter of these proposed reimbursement changes are currently scheduled to be phased in over a two year period beginning january  if we annualized our fourth quarter procedure mix  payor mix and volume  we estimate that the first phase of the proposed rule would negatively impact our annual earnings per share by to 
we estimate that the final phase of the proposed rule  including the impact of the first phase  would negatively impact our annual earnings per share by to 
on february   the president signed into law the deficit reduction act of this legislation requires cms to  among other things  limit medicare reimbursements for surgical procedures furnished in ascs to the amount paid to a hospital for the same service effective for services furnished on and after january  cms implemented this change effective january  since medicare previously paid ascs more than hospitals for certain procedures commonly furnished in our facilities  this change reduced reimbursement for certain services furnished in our facilities and negatively impacted our business 
considering the procedures performed in our ascs in and prior years  the most significant impact to us from this legislation is the reduction in the medicare facility fee for the after cataract laser surgery procedure which is also known as the yag procedure 
based on the number of yag procedures performed in our ascs during the fourth quarter of  we estimate that the annual impact from the decreased medicare facility fee paid for these procedures is a reduction of approximately million to million in net surgical facilities revenue 
this would equate to an estimated negative impact in earnings per share of between and 
to the extent that other payors  governmental and private  adopt this practice  the impact could be greater 
under current regulations  asc covered procedures  ie  those for which a facility fee is provided by the medicare program  are those procedures specifically approved by cms 
cms develops and maintains a listing of asc covered procedures defined by hcpcs code 
a facility fee is available only for listed procedure codes 
at present  approximately  procedures are approved for the asc setting 
cms is required by law to update the list of asc covered procedures every two years 
cms has disregarded this requirement for many years 
there is a substantial risk that cms will occasionally disregard this statutory requirement  and not update the list of asc covered procedures as required by law 
there also is a material risk that cms will reduce the number of asc covered procedures 
on november   cms proposed to delete procedures from the list of asc covered procedures  including many procedures that are commonly furnished in asc settings 
although cms ultimately decided in may to delete only five of the proposed procedures  cms could again propose and ultimately decide to substantially reduce the number of procedures for which medicare will pay an asc facility fee  a change that could affect the financial viability of our business 
to the extent that any procedures performed at our ascs are deleted from the list of asc covered procedures  it could negatively and materially affect our revenue and business 
considerable uncertainty surrounds the future determination of medicare reimbursement levels for ambulatory surgical services 
services reimbursable under the medicare program are subject to legislative change  administrative rulings  interpretations  discretion  governmental funding restrictions and requirements for utilization review 
such matters  as well as more general governmental budgetary concerns  may significantly reduce payments made to ascs under this program  and there can be no assurance that future medicare payment rates will be sufficient to cover the costs of  or cost increases in  providing services to medicare patients 
revenue from laser vision correction procedures comprised approximately of our surgical facilities net revenue for the year ended december  the market for providing laser vision correction and other refractive surgery procedures continues to be highly competitive 
in response  many of our competitors are offering laser vision correction or other refractive surgery services at lower prices than the prices we charge 
if price competition continues  however  we may choose or be forced to lower the facility fees we charge in our surgical facilities 
if we lower our fees  we could experience reductions in our revenue  profitability and cash flow 
as we develop and acquire more multi specialty ascs  we anticipate that the percentage of our surgical facilities net revenue derived from governmental payors such as medicare will decrease while reimbursements from private third party payors will increase 
given this changing payor mix  our success will depend on our ability to negotiate favorable contracts with private third party payors 
even though our relative dependence on medicare reimbursements may decrease  our revenue from private third party payors could be negatively affected by any adverse medicare changes because many private third party payors tie their reimbursement levels to medicare rates 
our failure to operate  acquire or develop a sufficient number of profitable surgical facilities could limit our profitability and revenue growth our growth strategy is focused on growing our existing ascs and acquiring or developing new ascs in a cost effective manner 
we may not experience an increase in surgical procedures at our existing or future ascs 
we may not be able to achieve the economies of scale and patient base  or provide the business  administrative and financial services required to grow or sustain profitability in our existing and future ascs 
newly acquired or developed facilities may generate losses or experience lower operating margins than our more established facilities  or they may not generate returns that justify our investment 
the current market for asc acquisitions is very competitive  and most potential targets are evaluating offers from multiple bidders 
this bidding process often results in increased purchase prices and less favorable transaction terms 
in many instances  we have dropped out of the bidding because we thought the price was too high or other proposed terms were unacceptable 
we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition or development targets  successfully negotiate the acquisition or development of these facilities on satisfactory terms  or have the access to adequate capital to finance these endeavors 
we anticipate that we will fund the acquisition and development of future ascs from cash generated from our operations and amounts borrowed under our credit facility 
the maximum commitment available under our credit facility is currently million 
our current credit facility expires on february  as of february   we have approximately million of availability under our credit facility 
given that we intend to continue to finance our acquisitions by using a combination of cash generated from our business operations and borrowings under our credit facility  we may in the future need to increase our maximum available commitment 
we have an option under our credit facility to increase the maximum commitment to million under certain conditions 
to the extent we are able to increase our maximum commitment  if at all  such an increase may not be on terms that are favorable to us or sufficient for our needs 
our maximum borrowing availability and applicable interest rates under our credit facility are calculated based on a ratio of our total indebtedness to our earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  all as more fully defined in our credit facility 
our credit facility currently provides for temporary increases in this ratio through september  for purposes of calculating our maximum borrowing availability 
this ratio will decrease following september  and will reduce our maximum borrowing capacity 
in addition  our higher level of borrowings and the continued periodic escalation in interest rates have increased our borrowing costs which have adversely affected our profitability 
if we are unable to successfully implement our growth strategy or manage our growth effectively  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
our revenue and profitability could decrease if we are unable to maintain positive relationships with the physicians who perform surgical procedures at our ascs the success of our business depends on our relationship with  and the success and efforts of  the physicians who perform surgical procedures at our ascs 
our physician partners may perform surgical procedures at other facilities or hospitals  are not required to use our ascs and may choose not to perform procedures at our ascs 
our revenue and profitability would decline if our relationship with key physicians deteriorated or those physicians reduced or eliminated their use of our ascs 
in addition  our business and reputation could be damaged if the physicians who use our ascs fail to provide quality medical care or follow required professional guidelines at our facilities 
in addition  co owning ascs with physicians may create additional regulatory risk 
see government regulation federal law anti kickback statute 
our indebtedness could limit our flexibility as we borrow to fund acquisitions we may become significantly leveraged in the future 
our acquisition and development program requires substantial capital resources and the operations of our existing ascs also require ongoing capital expenditures 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors  including the timing and size of our acquisitions  development and expansion activities  capital requirements associated with our ascs  and the future cost of medical equipment 
as of february   we have approximately million of availability under our credit facility 
if we identify favorable acquisition and development opportunities that require additional resources  we may be required to incur additional indebtedness in order to pursue these opportunities 
we may be unable to obtain sufficient financing on terms satisfactory to us  or at all 
as a result  our acquisition and development activities would have to be curtailed or eliminated and our financial results would be adversely affected 
the degree to which we are leveraged could also cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness  reducing the funds available for our operations 
as our indebtedness increases  the portion of our borrowings at variable interest rates will also likely increase which will leave us vulnerable to interest rate increases 
our degree of leverage may also make us vulnerable to a downturn in our business or the economy generally and  to the extent we become more highly leveraged than some of our competitors  place us at a competitive disadvantage 
our increased indebtedness and higher borrowing costs may require us to seek additional equity financing 
to the extent any such equity financing is available to us  it may be dilutive to our current equity holders 
our operating margins and profitability could suffer if we are unable to manage effectively  and grow the revenue of  our increasing number of ascs our growth strategy includes increasing our revenue and earnings by increasing the number of procedures performed at our ascs 
because we do not anticipate price increases from third party payors  our operating margins will be adversely affected if we do not increase the revenue and procedure volume of our existing ascs to offset increases in our operating costs 
we seek to increase procedure volume and revenue at our ascs by increasing the number of physicians performing procedures at our facilities  obtaining new or more favorable managed care contracts  improving patient flow at our centers and achieving operating efficiencies 
we may not be successful in these endeavors 
we acquired ten ascs in and our business strategy contemplates us continuing to acquire and develop more ascs in the future 
our growth has placed  and will continue to place  increased demands on our employees  business systems and other resources 
continued expansion of our operations will require substantial financial resources and management attention 
to accommodate our past and anticipated future growth  we will need to continue to implement and improve the management and operation of our business systems and to expand  train  manage and motivate our employees 
our operating results could suffer if we don t properly manage our growth 
we may not compete effectively with other companies that have greater resources and experience than us or that may have the ability to influence our licensure competitors with substantially greater financial  technical  managerial  marketing and other resources and experience may compete more effectively than us 
we compete with other businesses  including asc companies  hospitals  individual physicians  other ascs  laser vision correction centers  eye care clinics and providers of retail optical products 
competitors with substantially greater resources may be more successful in acquiring and developing surgical facilities 
hospitals and other ascs may be more successful in attracting physicians to utilize their facilities 
our optical laboratories and optical products purchasing organization also face competition on national  regional and local levels 
companies in other health care industry segments  including managers of hospital based medical specialties or large group medical practices  may become competitors in providing ascs and surgical equipment  as well as competitive eye care related services 
competition for retaining the services of highly qualified medical  technical and managerial personnel is significant 
we also face competitive pressures from local hospitals 
in addition to competing for patients and physician relationships  ascs are often required by medicare and certain state laws to maintain a written transfer agreement with an area hospital 
a transfer agreement provides that a hospital will accept an asc s patient in the event of an emergency 
generally  we have not encountered problems obtaining transfer agreements from area hospitals 
in limited instances  however  we have observed hospitals resisting entering into transfer agreements for what we believe to be competitive reasons 
while there often are alternatives for ascs to comply with federal and state regulations without a transfer agreement  competitive pressures from hospitals may make it more difficult and or expensive for our ascs to maintain their licensure and or medicare certification 
changes in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations  or adoption of new laws or regulations  governing our business operations  including physician use and or ownership of ascs  could result in penalties to us  require us to incur significant expenditures  or force us to make changes to our business operations we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision under federal  state and local laws and regulations 
many of these laws and regulations are subject to varying interpretations  and courts and regulatory authorities generally have provided limited clarification 
moreover  state and local laws and interpretations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
as a result  we may not always be able to accurately predict interpretations of applicable law  and federal and state authorities could challenge some of our activities  including our co ownership of ascs with physicians and other investors 
if any of our activities are challenged  we may have to divert substantial time  attention and resources from running our business to defend our activities against these challenges  regardless of their merit 
if we do not successfully defend these challenges  we may face a variety of adverse consequences  including loss of use of our ascs  losing our eligibility to participate in medicare or medicaid or losing other contracting privileges  or in some instances  civil or criminal fines or penalties 
any of these results could impair our sources of revenue and our profitability and limit our ability to grow our business 
for example  the federal anti kickback statute prohibits the knowing and willful solicitation  receipt  offer or payment of any direct or indirect remuneration in return for the referral of patients or the ordering or purchasing of items or services payable under medicare  medicaid or other federal health care programs 
this statute is very broad and congress directed the department of health and human services to develop regulatory exceptions  known as safe harbors  to the statute s referral prohibitions 
while we have attempted to structure the ownership and operation of our ascs within a safe harbor  we do not satisfy all of the requirements 
because there is no legal requirement that relationships fit within a safe harbor  a business arrangement that does not comply with the safe harbor  or for which a safe harbor does not exist  does not necessarily violate the anti kickback statute 
presently  despite the fact that we do not fit within a safe harbor  we believe that our ownership and operation of ascs complies with the anti kickback statute 
however  existing interpretations or enforcement of the federal anti kickback statute or other applicable federal or state laws and regulations could change 
if so  violations of the anti kickback statute or other laws may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties and exclusion from participation in medicare  medicaid and other federally funded programs 
in addition  there also is a material risk that congress  cms or the states could revise physician ownership and referral laws in a manner that could prohibit or limit physician ownership of ascs 
in december  congress enacted legislation imposing an month moratorium on physician referrals to certain categories of hospitals  ie  those classified as specialty hospitals under the law  if the physician has an ownership interest in the entity 
this moratorium expired in june future actions by either congress or cms to extend or possibly expand the scope of the moratorium potentially could prohibit or limit physician ownership of ascs 
additionally  several states are considering limits on physician ownership in and referrals to specialty hospitals  and a few are considering similar limitations on physician ownership in and referrals to ascs 
to the extent that congress  cms or any of the states act to prohibit or limit physician ownership of ascs  the investment structure of our ascs could be affected 
our limited liability company agreements and limited partnership agreements pursuant to which we own our ascs provide that if certain laws and regulations change  or the interpretation and or enforcement of such laws and regulations change  we may have to purchase some or all of the equity interests in our ascs owned by physicians 
the regulatory changes that could trigger this repurchase include it becoming i illegal for a physician to own an equity interest in one of our ascs  ii illegal for physician owners in our ascs to refer medicare or other patients to the facility  or iii substantially likely that the receipt by physician owners of cash distributions from the limited liability company or partnership will be illegal 
the cost of repurchasing these equity interests would be substantial 
we may not have sufficient capital resources to fund these obligations  and it may trigger the need to procure additional debt or equity financing 
to the extent any such financing was available to us  it may be on terms that reduce our earnings or are dilutive to our current equity holders 
while we attempt to structure these purchase obligations as favorable as possible to us  the triggering of these obligations could have a significantly negative effect on our financial condition and business prospects 
furthermore  cms may revise the medicare conditions for coverage of asc services 
our medicare certified ascs are required to comply with a series of regulatory obligations in order to qualify services furnished in those facilities for medicare reimbursement 
cms has not revised the medicare regulatory conditions for coverage in many years  but has in recent years indicated its intent to update these requirements through notice and comment rulemaking 
it is our expectation that our facilities and operations could be modified as necessary to comply with whatever new conditions might be established 
however  bringing our facilities and operations into compliance could involve substantial costs to the company 
moreover  it is possible that our facilities and operations could not be revised sufficiently to be in compliance with new medicare conditions  in which case some or all of our ascs may be forced to disenroll from the medicare program 
many governmental and private payors require medicare certification as a condition to participate in their payment plans 
any asc not enrolled in medicare may likewise be precluded from enrolling in other governmental and private payor plans 
such exclusion would have a material negative effect on our business 
regulation of the construction  acquisition or expansion of ascs could prevent us from developing  acquiring  expanding or relocating facilities most states require licenses to own and operate ascs  and some states require a certificate of need  or con  to construct or modify an asc 
several states recently have been revising licensure and con laws in a manner that makes it more difficult to develop or relocate ascs 
if we are unable to procure the appropriate state licensure approvals  or if we are unable to obtain a con in states with con laws  then we may not be able to acquire or construct a sufficient number of ascs  or to expand the scope of services offered in our existing ascs  to achieve our growth strategy 
procuring these approvals could take considerable time  effort and expense  and may result in delays in opening new or modified facilities 
moreover  if we are unable to maintain good relations with the landlords of our ascs  we may be forced to relocate a facility from time to time 
if we are forced to relocate a facility  we may incur substantial costs in building out and furnishing our new location 
in addition  depending on the state  we may also have difficulty obtaining the necessary state licensure and con approvals to relocate the facility 
see government regulation state law 
the nature of being actively involved in acquiring ascs could subject us to potential claims and material liabilities relating to these businesses although we conduct extensive due diligence prior to acquiring an asc and are generally indemnified by the sellers  our acquisitions could subject us to claims  suits or liabilities relating to unknown or contingent liabilities or from incidents occurring prior to our acquisition of the facility 
if we incur these liabilities and are not indemnified or insured for them  our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
rapid technological advances may reduce our sources of revenue and our profitability adoption of new technologies that may be comparable or superior to existing technologies for surgical equipment could reduce the amount of the facility fees we receive from physicians who use our surgical facilities  or the amount of revenue derived from our laser services agreements 
reduction of these sources of revenue could decrease our profitability 
we also may have to expend significant capital resources to deploy new technology and related equipment to remain competitive 
our inability to provide access to new and improving technology could deter physicians from using our surgical facilities or equipment 
loss of the services of key management personnel could adversely affect our business our success depends  in part  on the services of key management personnel  including thomas s 
hall our president  chief executive officer and chairman of the board  jack m 
clark  our executive vice president and chief revenue officer  and scott t 
macomber  our executive vice president and chief financial officer 
we do not know of any reason why we might be likely to lose the services of any of these officers 
however  in light of the role that each of these officers is expected to play in our future growth  if we lost the services of any of these officers  we believe that our business could be adversely affected 
the nature of our business could subject us to potential malpractice  product liability and other claims the provision of surgical services entails the potentially significant risk of physical injury to patients and an inherent risk of potential malpractice  product liability and other similar claims 
our insurance may not be adequate to satisfy claims or protect us and this coverage may not continue to be available at acceptable costs 
a partially or completely uninsured claim against us could reduce our earnings and working capital 
our insurance policies are generally renewed on an annual basis 
although we believe we will be able to renew our current policies or otherwise obtain comparable professional liability coverage  we have no control over the potential costs to renew 
increases in professional liability and other insurance premiums will negatively affect our profitability 
if a change in events or circumstances causes us to write off a portion of our intangible assets  our total assets could be reduced significantly and we could incur a substantial charge to earnings intangible assets  primarily in the form of goodwill  represent a significant portion of our total assets 
at december   intangible assets of our continuing operations represented approximately of total assets and of stockholders equity 
the intangible asset value represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the separately identifiable net assets acquired in connection with our acquisitions and affiliations 
the value of these assets may not be realized 
we regularly  and at least annually  evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate all or a portion of the carrying amount of the asset may no longer be recoverable  in which case an impairment charge to earnings may become necessary 
if  in the future  we determine that our intangible assets have suffered an impairment that requires us to write off a portion of the asset due to a change in events or circumstances  this write off could significantly reduce our total assets and we could incur a substantial charge to earnings  as well as be in default under one or more covenants in our credit facility 
becoming and remaining compliant with federal regulations enacted under the health insurance portability and accountability act could require us to expend significant resources and capital  and could impair our profitability and limit our ability to grow our business numerous federal regulations have been adopted under the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa 
compliance with hipaa regulations governing patient privacy was required by april  we have taken actions in an effort to establish our compliance with hipaa s privacy regulations  and we believe that we are in substantial compliance with hipaa s privacy regulations 
these actions include having our ascs and affiliated providers implement new hipaa compliant policies and procedures  conducting employee hipaa training  identifying business associates with whom we need to enter into hipaa compliant contractual arrangements and various other measures 
ongoing implementation and oversight of these measures involves significant time  effort and expense 
other federal regulations adopted under hipaa require that our affiliated providers and us be capable of conducting certain standardized health care transactions  including billing and other claims transactions 
we have undertaken significant efforts  involving substantial time and expense  to assure that our ascs and affiliated providers can submit transactions in compliance with hipaa 
we anticipate that continuing time and expense will be required to maintain the ability to submit hipaa compliant transactions  and to make sure that newly acquired ascs can submit hipaa compliant transactions 
in addition  compliance with the hipaa security regulations was required by april  in general  the security regulations require ascs and other covered entities to implement reasonable technical  physical and administrative security measures to safeguard protected health information maintained  used and disclosed in electronic form 
we have taken actions in an effort to establish our compliance with hipaa s security regulations  and we believe that we are in substantial compliance with hipaa s security regulations 
ongoing implementation and oversight of these measures involves significant time  effort and expense 
hipaa violations could expose us to civil penalties of up to  per person per year for each violation or criminal penalties with fines of up to  and or up to years in prison per violation 
risks relating to our common stock fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may make it difficult to predict our future results of operations and may cause volatility in our stock price during  the market price of our common stock was volatile  fluctuating from a high trading price of to a low trading price of per share 
our results of operations have varied and may continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
we have a high level of fixed operating costs  including compensation costs and rent 
as a result  our profitability depends to a large degree on the volume of surgical procedures performed in  and on our ability to utilize the capacity of  our surgical facilities 
the timing and degree of fluctuations in our operating results will depend on several factors  including general economic conditions  decreases in demand for non emergency procedures due to severe weather  availability or sudden loss of the services of physicians who utilize our surgical facilities  availability or shortages of surgery related products and equipment  the timing and relative size of acquisitions  and the recording of gains or losses on the sale of minority interests in our ascs 
these kinds of fluctuations in quarterly operating results may make it difficult for you to assess our future results of operations and may cause a decline or volatility in our stock price 
any return on your investment in our stock will depend on your ability to sell our stock at a profit we have never declared or paid any dividends and our credit agreement prohibits payment of dividends on our common stock 
we anticipate that we will not declare dividends at any time in the foreseeable future 
instead we will retain earnings for use in our business 
as a result  your return on an investment in our stock likely will depend on your ability to sell our stock at a profit 
in addition  the stock market has  from time to time  experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock

asc strategy 
we measure the success of our asc strategy based on our ability to achieve or exceed the following key objectives acquire and develop new ascs 
we consider the acquisition and development of new ascs a key element of our long term growth strategy 
we currently have six employees dedicated to identifying and analyzing acquisition and development opportunities 
strengthen and build relationships with existing and new physician partners 
our physician partners play a significant role in the success of our ascs 
we share a common goal with our physician partners which is to operate efficient  productive and profitable ascs 
our objective is to own greater than of each asc but less than 
continue to increase revenue and improve operating margins in our existing ascs 
the primary source of revenue at our ascs is derived from surgical procedures performed 
profitable growth within our existing ascs is determined by our ability to maximize efficiency and utilization  expand into medical procedures beyond eye care  and provide quality service to our physicians and their patients 
in addition to the above key asc objectives  our overall strategy also includes maintaining a strong balance sheet  continuing to grow the other segments of our business  and attracting and retaining employees to help us achieve our growth objectives 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we annually review our financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies to ensure that our financial reporting and disclosures provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f  the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable  net of allowances 
revenue from surgical procedures performed at our surgical facilities and patient visits to our eye care practices  net of contractual allowances and a provision for doubtful accounts  is recognized at the time the service is performed 
the contractual allowance is the difference between the fee we charge and the amount we expect to be paid by the patient or the applicable third party payor  which includes medicare and private insurance 
we base our estimates for the contractual allowance on the medicare reimbursement rates when medicare is the payor  our contracted rate with other third party payors or our historical experience when we do not have a specific medicare or contracted rate 
we base our estimate for doubtful accounts on the aging category and our historical collection experience 
our optical products purchasing organization negotiates buying discounts with optical product manufacturers 
the buying discounts and any handling charges billed to the members of the purchasing organization represent the revenue recognized 
product sales revenue from our optical laboratories and marketing products and services business  net of an allowance for returns and discounts  is recognized when the product is shipped or service is provided to the customer 
we base our estimates for sales returns and discounts on historical experience and have not experienced significant fluctuations between estimated and actual return activity and discounts given 
accounts receivable have been reduced by the reserves for estimated contractual allowances and doubtful accounts noted above 
asset impairment 
in assessing the recoverability of our fixed assets  goodwill and other noncurrent assets  we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
income taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  we may be required to adjust our valuation allowance 
this could result in a charge to  or an increase in  income in the period such determination is made 
stock based compensation 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires us to measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards based on estimated fair values at the date of grant 
determining the fair value of share based awards requires judgment in developing assumptions  which involve a number of variables 
we calculate fair value by using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires estimates for expected volatility  expected dividends  the risk free interest rate and the expected term of the option 
we also estimate the expected service period over which our stock based awards will vest 
each of these assumptions  while reasonable  requires a certain degree of judgment and the fair value estimates could vary if actual results are materially different than those initially applied 
results of operations the following table summarizes our operating results as a percentage of net revenue for the years indicated

total net revenue increased by from million to million 
net revenue by segment is discussed below 
surgical facilities 
the table below summarizes surgical facilities net revenue and procedures performed for and net revenues generated from surgical facilities are derived from the fees charged for the procedures performed in our ascs and through our laser services agreements 
our procedure volume is directly impacted by the number of ascs we operate  the number of excimer lasers in service  and their respective utilization rates 
surgical facilities net revenue increased by from million to million 
this increase was primarily the result of a million increase from ascs we acquired or developed after january  new ascs and a million  or  increase from ascs that we owned for the entire comparable reporting periods same facility 
the increase in same facility net revenue was primarily the result of a increase in the number of same facility procedures performed and a increase in the net revenue per procedure due to a change in procedure mix 
increase dollars in thousands decrease surgical facilities same facility net revenue  of procedures    new ascs net revenue    of procedures    asc closure laser terminations net revenue    of procedures    on february   the president signed into law the deficit reduction act of this legislation requires the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms to limit medicare reimbursements for surgical procedures furnished in ascs to the amount paid to a hospital for the same service effective for services furnished on and after january  this change will negatively impact our business 
considering the procedures performed in our ascs in and prior years  the most significant impact to us from this legislation will be the reduction in the medicare facility fee for the after cataract laser surgery procedure  which is also known as the yag procedure 
based on the number of yag procedures performed in our ascs during the fourth quarter of  we estimate that the annual impact from the decreased medicare facility fee paid for these procedures is a reduction of approximately million to million in net surgical facilities revenue 
this would equate to an estimated negative impact in earnings per share of between and 
to the extent that other payors  governmental and private  adopt this practice  the impact could be greater 
on august   cms announced a proposed rule to revise the payment system for services provided in ascs 
the proposed rule included a revision in asc rates to approximately of the corresponding rates paid for surgical procedures performed in hospital outpatient departments 
the proposed rule includes a scheduled phase in of the revised rates over two years beginning january  in addition  the proposed rule provides for an annual increase in asc rates beginning in based on the consumer price index as well as an expansion of the list of procedures that can be performed in an asc 
cms is currently considering comments on its proposed rule and has stated that it expects to finalize the rule in the spring of  with an expected implementation date of january  the proposed rule  as written  would result in a reduction in the reimbursement rates for certain ophthalmology procedures  including cataract and yag procedures which made up approximately of the procedures performed in our ascs in the fourth quarter of the proposed rule also reduces reimbursement rates for gastroenterology and pain procedures which together made up approximately of the procedures performed in our ascs in the fourth quarter of conversely  the proposed rule increases reimbursement rates for certain procedures  including orthopedic procedures which made up approximately of the total procedures performed in our ascs in the fourth quarter of based on our fourth quarter procedure mix  payor mix and volume  we estimate that the first phase of the proposed rule would negatively impact our annual earnings per share between and 
we estimate that the final phase of the proposed rule  including the impact of the first phase  would negatively impact our annual earnings per share between and 
the success of our business depends on our relationship with  and the success and efforts of  the physicians who perform surgical procedures at our ascs 
our revenue and profitability would decline if our relationship with key physicians deteriorated or those physicians reduced or eliminated their use of our ascs 
in  we began to experience a significant decline in the number of procedures performed at one of our ascs acquired in this decline was primarily associated with certain physicians none of whom were physician partners no longer using the asc during we continued to experience a decline in the number of procedures performed at this asc for the first three quarters in over the same period in  but experienced an increase in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of net revenue from this asc in decreased approximately million  or  versus this decrease had a negative impact on net income in of approximately  product sales and other 
the table below summarizes product sales and other net revenue by significant business component 
product sales and other net revenue increased by from million to million 
net revenue at our marketing products and services business increased by million 
this increase is due to the addition of marketing consulting services associated with increased services provided to medical device manufacturers to promote their new refractive intraocular lens technology 
net revenue at our optical laboratory business increased by million due to an increase in existing customer orders and improved external marketing 
net revenue from our ophthalmology practice increased by million primarily due to an increase in the number of patient visits
