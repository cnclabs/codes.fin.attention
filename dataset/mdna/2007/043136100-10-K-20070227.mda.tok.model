overview we are a multi business medical device company that develops  manufactures and markets minimally invasive surgical products  many of which are based on our patented coblation technology 
we currently market minimally invasive surgical products across three core business units arthrocare sports medicine  arthrocare spine  and arthrocare ear  nose and throat ent but also have developed  manufactured and marketed coblation based and complementary products for application in neurology  cosmetic surgery  urology and gynecology  with research continuing in additional areas 
in each of our core business units we are focused on driving the application of enabling technologies  primarily for plasma based soft tissue removal  and increasing the number of minimally invasive procedures being performed 
in december  we introduced our arthroscopy system commercially in the united states and have derived a significant portion of our sales from this system 
our strategy includes placing controller units  which enable use of our disposable coblation products  at substantial discounts or placing controllers at customer sites at no cost in order to generate future disposable product revenue 
our strategy also includes applying our patented coblation technology to a range of other soft tissue surgical markets  including the products we have introduced in the fields of spinal surgery  neurosurgery  gynecology  urology  cosmetic surgery  ent surgery  cardiology and general surgery 
we cannot be sure that any of our clinical studies in other fields will lead to k applications or that the applications will be cleared by the fda on a timely basis  if at all 
in addition  we cannot be sure that the products  if cleared for marketing  will ever achieve commercial acceptance 
in may  we announced that we had entered the ear  nose and throat market and had formed a business unit called entec to commercialize coblation technology in this field 
in september  we announced that we had entered the spinal surgery market 
in february  we announced that we were expanding our marketing efforts for our spinal surgery system to specifically address selected applications in neurosurgery 
we are marketing and selling our spinal surgery products through a network of independent distributors and direct sales representatives supported by regional managers worldwide 
in january  we acquired mda and its majority owned subsidiary  parallax  a business focused on the treatment of vertebral compression fractures 
in november  we acquired opus medical  a business focused on soft tissue to bone repair systems  including systems for the treatment of rotator cuff injuries 
in august  we completed the purchase of substantially all of the assets of applied therapeutics  inc  or ati  a maker of sinus surgery treatment products 
we have received k clearance from the fda to market several of our products and several of our products are ce marked  which is a requirement to sell our products in most of western europe 
specifically  we have received k clearance from the fda to market our coblation based arthroscopic surgery system  or arthroscopic system  for use in arthroscopic surgery of the knee  shoulder  ankle  elbow  wrist and hip 
in addition  our arthroscopic system is ce marked for use in arthroscopic surgery 
we have also received k 
table of contents 
index to financial statements clearances in the united states and a ce mark in europe to market and sell our coblation based spinal surgery system for spinal surgery and neurosurgery 
our ent surgery system has received k clearances from the fda and a ce mark for use in general head  neck  oral and sinus surgery procedures  including tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy  turbinate reduction to relieve nasal obstruction  and soft palate stiffening to treat snoring 
the fda also has cleared our cosmetic surgery system for general dermatologic procedures and skin resurfacing in connection with wrinkle reduction procedures 
in addition  the cosmetic surgery system has received a ce mark 
we also have received k clearance from the fda  and applied for a ce mark  to market products based on our coblation technology for use in urology  gynecology  plastic and reconstructive surgery  orthopedic surgery and general surgery 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below and are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize product revenue after shipment of our products to customers has occurred  any acceptance terms have been fulfilled  no significant contractual obligations remain and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
revenue is reported net of a provision for estimated product returns 
we recognize license fee and other revenue over the term of the associated agreement unless the fee is in exchange for products delivered or services performed that represent the culmination of a separate earnings process 
royalties are recognized as earned  generally based on the licensees product shipments 
these items are classified as royalties  fees and other revenues in the accompanying statements of operations 
amounts billed to customers relating to shipping and handling costs have also been classified as royalties  fees and other revenues and related costs are classified as cost of product sales in the accompanying statements of operations 
additionally  we assess risks of loss on accounts receivable and make adjustments to our allowance for doubtful accounts based on our assessment 
in estimating this allowance  we consider factors such as historical collection experience  a customer s current credit worthiness  customer concentrations  the age of the receivable balance  both individually and in the aggregate  and general economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
actual customer collections could differ from our estimates 
we believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts of million at december  is adequate to provide for probable losses associated with accounts receivable 
inventory allowance inventory purchases and commitments are based upon future demand forecasts 
we record an allowance against our inventory value to the extent we believe that demand for certain inventory items has decreased or if certain inventory items have become obsolete 
if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we could be required to increase our inventory allowances and our gross margins could be adversely affected

index to financial statements business combinations accounting for our business acquisitions requires extensive accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price between net tangible assets  in process research and development  other identifiable intangible assets  and goodwill 
assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the purchase method of accounting at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition 
the company accounts for business combinations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we currently have recorded goodwill related to our acquisitions of ati  atlantech  mda and opus medical 
we have accumulated goodwill of million and other intangible assets of million as of december  in response to changes in industry and market conditions  we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring  disposing  or otherwise exiting businesses  which could result in an impairment of goodwill 
we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and more frequently if impairment indicators are identified 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value 
we estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flow valuation models and by comparing our reporting units to guideline publicly traded companies 
these methods require estimates of our future revenues  profits  capital expenditures  working capital  and other relevant factors  as well as selecting appropriate guideline publicly traded companies for each reporting unit 
we estimate these amounts by evaluating historical trends  current budgets  operating plans  industry data  and other relevant factors 
the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded its respective carrying value in fiscal  indicating the underlying goodwill of each reporting unit was not impaired as of our most recent testing date 
accordingly  we were not required to complete the second step of the goodwill impairment test 
the timing and frequency of our goodwill impairment test is based on an ongoing assessment of events and circumstances that would more than likely reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
we will continue to monitor our goodwill balance and conduct formal tests on at least an annual basis or earlier when impairment indicators are present 
there are various assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment loss  and estimates using different  but each reasonable  assumptions could produce significantly different results and materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
therefore  the timing and recognition of impairment losses by us in the future  if any  may be highly dependent upon our estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates utilized were appropriate based on the information available to management 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over the estimated useful life of each asset 
we monitor conditions related to these assets to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining amortization period 
to date  we have not had an impairment associated with these intangible assets 
in connection with the opus and ati acquisitions  we made significant estimates of million and million  respectively  related to the valuation of purchased in process research and development ipr d projects 
our policy defines ipr d as the value assigned to those projects which have no alternative future use  including those for which the related products have not reached technological feasibility or have not received regulatory approval 
determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to ipr d requires significant estimates 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to ipr d is determined by estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows of each project or technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
the discount rate used is determined at the time of acquisition  in accordance with accepted valuation methods  and includes consideration of the assessed risk of the project not being developed to a stage of commercial feasibility 
contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
in determining loss contingencies  we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of 
table of contents 
index to financial statements a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accrual estimates should be adjusted 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method  whereby deferred tax asset or liability account balances are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using the tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax assets to the amount that is believed to be realizable under the more likely than not recognition criteria 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
it is possible that in the future we may change our estimate of the amount of the deferred income tax assets that would more likely than not be realized 
this would result in an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance that would either increase or decrease  as applicable  reported net income in the period the change in estimate is made 
in addition  we make an evaluation at the end of each reporting period as to whether or not some or all of the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested as that term is defined in generally accepted accounting principles 
while we may have concluded in the past that some of such undistributed earnings are permanently reinvested  facts and circumstances can change in the future  and it is possible that a change in facts and circumstances  such as a change in the expectation regarding the capital needs of our foreign subsidiaries  could result in a conclusion that some or all of such undistributed earnings are no longer permanently reinvested 
in such an event  we would be required to recognize a deferred income tax liability in an amount equal to the estimated incremental us income tax and withholding tax liability that would be generated if all of such previously considered permanently reinvested undistributed earnings were distributed to the us stock based compensation on january   we adopted fas revised  share based payment fas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees  including employee stock options  restricted stock awards and employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan espp based on estimated grant date fair values 
stock based compensation expense recognized under fas r for the year ended december  was million 
stock based compensation expense relating to restricted stock awards and non employee stock options for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
there was no stock based compensation expense related to employee stock options recognized during the years ended december  and see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
upon adoption of fas r  we began estimating the value of employee stock options on the date of grant using the black scholes model  as we had previously used for the purpose of disclosing pro forma financial information 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility  employee stock option exercise behavior  and related tax implications associated with relocating administrative functions to austin  texas 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the weighted average fair value of stock awards  excluding restricted stock  granted for year ended december  was per share and per share for the espp  using the black scholes model with the following weighted average assumptions year ended december  options espp expected term in years expected volatility risk free interest rate expected dividends the expected term assumption for options was determined based on historical data  adjusted for the recent reduction of the contractual life for options from to seven years 
the expected volatility was determined using a blend of implied volatility and historical volatility over the expected term  which we consider a better indictor of expected volatility than using only historical volatility 
the risk free interest rate is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the term of the company s awards 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures at a rate of percent 
fas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience but actual forfeitures could differ materially and result in volatility in our stock based compensation expense amounts 
overview of financial results relative to the year ended december   total revenue for the year increased percent to million 
the increase was driven by the combined performance of all business units 
international product sales represented approximately percent of net product sales for the year 
no single customer accounted for more than percent of our net product sales 
total operating expenses were approximately million for  compared to million in this million increase was driven by a combination of factors approximately million of the increase was due to stock based compensation expense associated with our adoption of fas r  million represents increased training and promotion costs  million in legal  accounting and other outside consulting costs  million in additional compensation and commission related expenses associated with our increased direct sales force and million associated with employee related costs due to our increased accounting and finance personnel

table of contents 
index to financial statements our sustained increase in direct sales presence has continued to have a positive effect on product sales since inception  as did the execution of our strategic plan to build market share through promotional programs of controller placements  commercialization of our technology in fields outside of arthroscopy  and the introduction of new products designed to address surgical procedures that have traditionally been difficult to perform 
additionally  our acquisitions of atlantech  parallax  ati and opus medical product lines have continued to have a positive effect on sales growth 
we generally sell our disposable devices at or near list price  except for sales to international distributors and marketing partners  which are sold at discounted prices 
we anticipate that disposable device sales will remain a key component of our product sales in the near future 
based upon the estimated number of arthroscopic procedures performed each year  we believe that knee procedures represent the largest segment of the arthroscopic market  while shoulder procedures represent the fastest growing segment 
to achieve increasing disposable device sales in arthroscopy over time  we believe we must continue to penetrate the market in knee procedures  expand physicians education with respect to coblation technology  and continue to work on new product development efforts specifically for knee applications 
we believe that  in our ten years of product shipments  we have penetrated to percent of the hospitals that perform arthroscopic procedures in the united states 
we believe that approximately percent of our arthroscopy product sales are being generated by the sale of disposables for use in knee procedures 
we expect our sales to continue to be strong in  as we continue to increase our presence in europe and benefit from the integration of our recent acquisitions 
royalties  fees  and other revenues consist mainly of revenue from the licensing of our products and technology and shipping and handling costs billed to customers 
royalties  fees  and other revenues increased to million in from million and million in and  respectively  as a result of increased sales of our products and growth in the markets for which we receive royalties 
cost of product sales cost of product sales consist of manufacturing costs  material costs  labor costs  manufacturing overhead  warranty and other direct product costs 
additionally  cost of product sales includes amortization of controller unit placements under a program whereby we maintain ownership of controller units shipped to customers  with the costs being capitalized and amortized into cost of product sales over the useful life of the controller unit 
amortization of controllers was million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
controller amortization represented percent of product sales in this is compared to and  when controller amortization represented percent and percent of product sales  respectively 
cost of product sales for the year ended december  includes million of stock based compensation expense related to employee stock options 
the decrease as a percent of cost of sales for compared to is driven by the slower growth in controller placements volume in conjunction with increased revenue reported for the period 
the decrease as a percent of cost of sales for compared to is driven by the leveling of controller placements in conjunction with increased revenue reported for the period 
cost of product sales was million  or percent of total revenues  for  compared to million  or percent of total revenues  in and million  or percent of total revenues  in gross product margin as a percentage of sales increased to percent in from percent in and percent in the increase in gross product margin percentage for the year ended december  compared to the same period in is a result of an increase in average selling prices accompanied by a decrease in component costs 
the favorable increase in gross product margin percentage in as compared to is due to lower manufacturing costs at our costa rica manufacturing facility  including the benefit of a full year of opus production in costa rica  as well as improved margins from the mda acquisition 
controller manufacturing was principally conducted in costa rica during  where we benefited from lower labor rates as compared to

operating expenses research and development expense increased in to million  or percent of total revenues  from million  or percent of total revenues  in and million  or percent of total revenues  in the dollar increase in research and development expenses in compared to is primarily attributable to million in increased stock compensation expense due to our adoption of fas r  along with a continued investment in our coblation based products and in the mda product line  resulting in an increase of million in consulting and outside service costs  million in additional depreciation expense  and million in patent related and product development charges 
the increase in research and development costs in as compared to is primarily due to million in increased compensation and related expenses due to additional headcount  million in prototype development costs  million in outside services  and million in fixed charges  primarily depreciation and rent 
we expect to increase the dollar amount of research and development expenses through continued expenditures on new product development  regulatory affairs  clinical studies and patents 
we expect these expenses as a percentage of product sales to remain essentially flat 
sales and marketing expense increased to million  or percent of total revenues  in from million  or percent of total revenues  in  and from million  or percent of total revenues  in the increase in absolute dollars for compared to related primarily to million in training and promotion costs  million in additional compensation and related expenses associated with our increased direct sales force  million in stock based compensation expense associated with our adoption of fas r  and million in settlement fees associated with the settlement and license agreement between arthrocare and martec  llc formerly bonutti ip  llc 
increased expenses in as compared to related primarily to million in increased sales commissions associated with increased sales volume  million in additional compensation and related expenses associated with our increased direct sales force  and million in increased accounts receivable reserves 
we anticipate that sales and marketing spending will continue to increase in absolute dollars as a result of the expansion of our distribution capabilities to address the spinal surgery and ear  nose and throat markets  higher dealer commissions from increased sales  the additional cost of penetrating international markets  higher promotional  demonstration and sample expenses  and additional investments in the sales  marketing and support staff necessary to commercialize and market future products 
general and administrative expense increased to million  or percent of total revenues  in  from million  or percent of total revenues  in and million  or percent of total revenues  in the increase is primarily due to a net increase of million in legal  accounting and other outside services costs  which reflects the receipt of settlement payments associated with the smith nephew license and settlement agreement  recorded as a reduction in legal fees  million of stock based compensation expense associated with our adoption of fas r  million of additional compensation and related expenses associated with increasing our headcount in our accounting and other administrative functions  and million in facilities and insurance charges

we expect that amortization of intangible assets will increase in future periods as we acquire additional assets 
acquired in process research and development costs ipr d were not incurred by us during the year ended december  during the third quarter of we incurred million of acquired in process research and development costs in connection with the research and development efforts acquired in our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of ati 
prior to the acquisition  we did not have a comparable product under development

of the million increase in net interest and other expense in compared to  approximately million is associated with interest on debt incurred due to our acquisitions of mda and opus medical 
the remaining increase in net expense is primarily attributable to foreign exchange losses incurred in we do not expect material fluctuations in interest and other income since we plan to fund our business through our operating cash flows in the foreseeable future

the credit agreement also contains various covenants that specify minimum or maximum financial ratios 
we were in compliance with all such covenants at december  disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors  including fluctuations in our operating results  accounts receivable collections  inventory management  expensing of stock options  and the timing of tax and other payments

excluding any acquisition related activities  we plan to fund our future operations through our operating cash flows 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including our success in commercializing our products  development and commercialization of products in fields other than arthroscopy  the ability of our suppliers to continue to meet our demands at current prices  obtaining and enforcing patents important to our business  the status of regulatory approvals and competition 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin  an interpretation of fas  prescribes a comprehensive model for recognizing  measuring  presenting and disclosing in the financial statements tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  including a decision whether to file or not to file in a particular jurisdiction 
fin also includes guidance concerning accounting for income tax uncertainties in interim periods and increases the level of disclosures associated with any recorded income tax uncertainties 
fin is effective beginning january  the differences between the amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior to the adoption of fin and the amounts reported after adoption will be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance of retained earnings 
implementation of fin requires management to develop judgmental estimates about tax uncertainties

sab  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab was issued in order to eliminate the diversity of practice surrounding how public companies quantify financial statement misstatements 
in sab  the sec staff established an approach that requires quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of the misstatements on each of our financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures 
this model is commonly referred to as a dual approach because it requires quantification of errors under both the iron curtain and the roll over methods 
we currently use  and have historically applied  the dual method for quantifying identified financial statement misstatements
