item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview murphy oil corporation is a worldwide oil and gas exploration and production company with refining and marketing operations in north america and the united kingdom 
a more detailed description of the company s significant assets can be found in item of this form k report 
murphy generates revenue primarily by selling its oil and natural gas production and its refined petroleum products to customers at hundreds of locations in the united states  canada  the united kingdom  malaysia and other countries 
the company s revenue is highly affected by the prices of oil  natural gas and refined petroleum products that it sells 
also  because crude oil is purchased by the company for refinery feedstocks  natural gas is purchased for fuel at its refineries and oil fields  and gasoline is purchased to supply its retail gasoline stations in north america that are primarily located at wal mart supercenters  the purchase prices for these commodities also have a significant effect on the company s costs 
in order to make a profit and generate cash in its exploration and production business  revenue generated from the sales of oil and natural gas produced must exceed the combined costs of producing these products  amortization of capital expenditures and expenses related to exploration and administration 
profits and generation of cash in the company s refining and marketing operations are dependent upon achieving adequate margins  which are determined by the sales prices for refined petroleum products less the costs of purchased refinery feedstocks and gasoline and expenses associated with manufacturing  transporting and marketing these products 
murphy also incurs certain costs for general company administration and for capital borrowed from lending institutions 
worldwide oil prices were generally higher in than in  while the average sales price for north american natural gas was lower in than the average price for a barrel of west texas intermediate crude oil in was  an increase of compared to the nymex natural gas price in averaged per million british thermal units mmbtu  down from changes in the price of crude oil and natural gas have a significant impact on the profitability of the company  especially the price of crude oil as oil represented approximately of the total hydrocarbons produced on an energy equivalent basis by the company in if the prices for crude oil and natural gas decline significantly in or beyond  the company would expect this to have an unfavorable impact on operating profits for its exploration and production business 
such lower oil and gas prices could  but may not  have a favorable impact on the company s refining and marketing operating profits 
results of operations the company had net income in of million  per diluted share  compared to net income in of million  per diluted share 
in the company s net income was million  per diluted share 
the net income reduction in compared to primarily related to lower earnings generated by the company s exploration and production and refining and marketing businesses 
in addition  the net cost of corporate activities was higher in than in the higher net income in compared to was caused by a combination of better earnings in the company s exploration and production and refining and marketing operations and lower net costs for corporate activities 
further explanations of each of these variances are found in the following sections 
income from continuing operations was million  per diluted share  in  million  per diluted share  in  and million  per diluted share  in income from discontinued operations was million  per diluted share  in  and million  per diluted share  in there was no impact from discontinued operations in in the second quarter the company sold most of its conventional oil and natural gas properties in western canada for cash proceeds of million  which generated an after tax gain on the sale of million in in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the gain on sale of these assets and operating results for the fields prior to their sale have been presented  net of income tax expense  as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended december  and income from discontinued operations in related to a favorable adjustment of income taxes associated with the gain on sale of the western canada properties in 
table of contents vs 
net income in was million  per diluted share  compared to million  per diluted share  in net income in included income from discontinued operations of million  which was per share 
the million decline in net income in was primarily due to lower earnings in both the company s exploration and production e p and refining and marketing r m or downstream businesses  plus higher net costs for corporate activities 
the company s e p earnings declined in due to several factors in the current year  including lower sales volumes for crude oil and natural gas caused by lower production levels for these products  lower natural gas sales prices in north america and higher production and administrative expenses 
in addition  in the company recorded an after tax gain of million related to a sale of most mature oil and natural gas properties on the continental shelf of the gulf of mexico 
the e p results were favorably impacted by higher crude oil sales prices  lower after tax exploration expenses  lower hurricane related costs and higher income tax benefits due to various tax rate changes 
company wide  the net costs associated with hurricanes were million higher in compared to hurricane costs in the company s r m business were million higher in due to more uninsured costs associated with repairs at the meraux  louisiana refinery  clean up of a crude oil spill that occurred at the refinery as a result of damages from hurricane katrina  and settlement of litigation associated with the oil spill 
hurricane costs in the company s e p business were lower in by million due to lower costs in the current year for equipment and facilities repair  discretionary employee assistance and hurricane related insurance in the current year 
earnings in the r m business were million in compared to million in this earnings reduction of million in was primarily caused by the aforementioned higher hurricane related costs 
excluding the higher hurricane costs  us downstream earnings improved in compared to  while earnings for downstream operations in the uk were down million from record levels in the company continued to expand its retail gasoline station business by adding sites in  with virtually all such additions located at wal mart supercenters 
the net costs of corporate activities were million in compared to million in these costs increased mostly due to an educational assistance contribution commitment amounting to million after tax  plus the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange movements as the us dollar weakened against most other major currencies used by company s operations  including the euro and the uk pound sterling 
in addition  corporate activity costs in were unfavorable because included income tax benefits of million from settlement of us income tax audits 
sales and other operating revenues in were billion higher than in mostly due to higher sales volumes and sales prices in the current year for refined petroleum products 
in addition  merchandise sales at retail gasoline stations increased in and the sales price of crude oil was higher in sales revenue was unfavorably affected in by lower sales volumes of crude oil and lower sales volumes and prices for natural gas 
gain on sale of assets before income taxes amounted to million in compared to million in the prior year included a pretax gain of million related to the sale of oil and natural gas properties on the gulf of mexico continental shelf 
interest and other income in was unfavorable to the prior year by million due mostly to higher foreign exchange charges associated with the unfavorable effects of the us dollar weakening against the euro and pound sterling in the current year 
crude oil and product purchases expense increased by billion in compared to due to higher prices for crude oil and other purchased refinery feedstocks  higher prices and volumes of refined petroleum products purchased for sale at retail gasoline stations  and higher levels of merchandise purchased for sale at these gasoline stations 
these higher costs were partially offset by lower volumes of crude oil purchased for feedstock in because the meraux refinery was off line for repairs for the first five months of the year 
operating expenses increased by million in compared to due to higher repairs and other production expenses in the company s e p operations  higher costs of operating retail gasoline stations primarily due to more stations in operation  and higher refinery operating costs mostly associated with higher labor costs at the company s meraux refinery 
exploration expenses were lower in compared to by million primarily due to lower dry hole charges in the current year in the republic of congo  but partially offset by higher dry hole and seismic and geophysical costs in the us the reasons for higher costs associated with hurricanes in were included in the previous paragraph 
selling and general expenses increased million in due to various factors in the year  including the pretax costs for an educational assistance contribution commitment  the costs of reorganizing the company s us e p operations  higher costs for professional consultants  and the initial costs of expensing the grant date fair value of stock options which began in depreciation  depletion and amortization expense was million lower in than generally due to lower volumes of crude oil and natural gas sold by the company s e p business 
depreciation expense in the downstream business was higher in mostly due to the continued addition of retail gasoline stations in the us accretion of asset retirement obligations increased by million in mostly due to higher asset retirement obligations for malaysian operations due to drilling development wells at the kikeh field in interest expense increased in by million due to higher average borrowings under the company s credit facilities 
the amount of interest costs capitalized to development projects increased by million in compared to due to higher capitalized costs associated with the kikeh field  offshore sabah malaysia  and the thunder hawk field in the deepwater gulf of mexico 
income tax expense in was lower than in by million due to lower pretax earnings in and net tax benefits in the 
table of contents current year from changes in tax rates in various taxing jurisdictions 
the effective income tax rate for consolidated earnings in was and included a net benefit of million of pretax income from the reduction of federal and provincial tax rates in canada offset in part by an increase in the tax rate on oil operations in the uk the effective tax rate in was of consolidated pretax earnings 
the tax rate in both years was higher than the us federal statutory tax rate of due to a combination of us state taxes  certain foreign tax rates that exceed the us federal tax rate  and certain exploration and other expenses in foreign taxing jurisdictions for which no income tax benefit is currently being recognized because the ability to obtain tax benefits for these costs in future years is uncertain 
vs 
net income in was million  per share  compared to million  per share  in income from continuing operations was million  per share  in compared to million  per share  in the million improvement in income from continuing operations in was caused by more favorable results in each of the company s e p and r m operations and lower net costs for corporate activities 
higher sales prices in for the company s oil and natural gas production was the primary driver for improved earnings of million in the e p business 
the other favorable factors in this business in were higher oil sales volumes and a larger gain on sale of oil and natural gas properties 
the company s e p earnings were unfavorably affected in by several factors  including higher insurance costs mostly caused by hurricanes katrina and rita  lower sales volumes for natural gas due to both the sale of properties in the gulf of mexico and downtime caused by the hurricanes  higher exploration expenses  lower income tax benefits and rising costs of supplies and services 
r m earnings were million in  up million compared to due to stronger realized margins for petroleum products sold in the us and uk the company expanded its retail fuel operations in both the uk and uk in by adding retail gasoline sites at wal mart supercenters in the us and by purchasing existing retail fuel stations in the uk the net costs of corporate activities were million lower in than in  with the favorable variance in mostly due to a combination of higher tax benefits associated with refund and settlement of prior year us taxes  lower canadian withholding taxes on dividends to murphy oil corporation from its canadian subsidiary  favorable effects from foreign currency exchange  and less net interest costs due to lower average borrowings and the capitalization of more interest costs on development projects in the e p business 
these were partially offset by higher selling and general expenses in  with the majority of this increase caused by larger employee compensation and benefit costs 
the company sold most of its conventional oil and natural gas assets in western canada in  and net income in and included income from these discontinued operations of million and million  respectively  which represented per share earnings of in and in income from discontinued operations in arose from a favorable adjustment of income taxes associated with the gain on sale in in  cash proceeds of million from the property sale led to an after tax gain of million  which is included in the amount above 
sales and other operating revenues in were billion higher than in primarily due to higher sales prices for oil  natural gas and refined petroleum products  higher sales volumes of crude oil and refined petroleum products  and higher merchandise sales revenue at retail gasoline stations 
sales were unfavorably affected in by lower volumes of natural gas sold 
the gain on sale of assets was million higher in  mostly due to a pretax gain of million on the sale of oil and gas properties on the gulf of mexico continental shelf in  partially offset by pretax profits in on sale of various properties other than the western canada assets included in discontinued operations 
interest and other income was favorable by million in compared to mostly due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange losses in that did not repeat in and higher interest income on a us income tax refund in crude oil and product purchases expense increased by billion in due to higher prices for crude oil and other purchased refinery feedstocks and higher prices for refined petroleum products purchased for sale at retail gasoline stations 
operating expenses increased million in due mostly to costs associated with more crude oil production and more retail service stations in operation in the us and us exploration expenses in the e p business were million higher in than in mostly due to more dry holes in malaysia and the republic of congo  plus more spending on d seismic acquisition and processing in malaysia in costs associated with hurricanes in of million related to additional insurance  repairs and other costs that arose due to hurricanes in the gulf of mexico during the year 
these storms  which damaged and temporarily shut down certain offshore us oil and gas production facilities and the meraux  louisiana refinery  led to uninsured repair costs of about million in and caused insurance costs in to rise by approximately million 
also included in this cost category in was million of ongoing meraux refinery salaries  benefits  depreciation and maintenance costs while the refinery was shut down for repairs  and also donations and additional employee compensation totaling million 
in accordance with the company s accounting policies  the increase in certain insurance costs related to the storm losses incurred by insurance companies was allocated to all segments of the company s business as all assets were covered by this property insurance 
costs associated with hurricanes were million in selling and general expenses were million more in mostly due to higher employee compensation and benefit costs 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense was million higher in due to more volumes of crude oil sold and more fueling stations operating in the 
table of contents us and us the company is experiencing higher drilling and other capital costs  which appear to be caused by added demand for such services due to the higher level of oil and natural gas sales prices 
accretion of asset retirement obligations was down million in due to sales of oil and natural gas properties on the continental shelf of the gulf of mexico in interest expense was down by million in compared to due to lower average outstanding debt in the portion of interest expense capitalized to development projects rose by million in primarily due to higher interest allocated to the kikeh development in malaysia and the syncrude expansion in western canada 
income tax expense was up million in mostly due to higher pretax earnings 
the effective income tax rate as a percentage of pretax income in of was unfavorably impacted by no tax benefits recognized on exploration expenses incurred in the republic of congo and blocks pm and h in malaysia  but was favorably affected by income tax benefits of million mostly related to refund and settlement of prior year us income tax matters 
segment results in the following table  the company s results of operations for the three years ended december  are presented by segment 
more detailed reviews of operating results for the company s exploration and production and refining and marketing activities follow the table 
millions of dollars exploration and production united states canada united kingdom ecuador malaysia other refining and marketing north america united kingdom corporate income from continuing operations income from discontinued operations net income exploration and production earnings from exploration and production operations were million in  million in and million in the million reduction in earnings compared to was mostly attributable to lower production of crude oil and natural gas  which led to lower sales volumes for these products 
lower natural gas sales prices and higher production and administrative expenses in and a million after tax gain on sale of oil and natural gas properties on the continental shelf of the gulf of mexico in also were factors that led to lower e p earnings in the current year 
e p earnings in were favorably impacted by higher realized oil sales prices  lower exploration expenses  lower hurricane related expenses and income tax benefits associated with tax rate changes enacted in the current year 
crude oil sales volumes were down in by compared to  while natural gas sales volumes were down by 
oil sales volumes were lower in primarily due to lower production at the front runner and habanero fields in the gulf of mexico caused by weaker field performances  lower production at the terra nova field  offshore newfoundland  due to the field being shut in for six months for major equipment repairs  and lower production at west patricia  offshore sarawak malaysia  due to a lower volumetric sharing percentage allocable to the company as the field matures 
the decline in natural gas sales volumes in was attributable to both the mid sale of mature gas properties on the gulf of mexico continental shelf and lower production in the current year from gas fields onshore south louisiana 
the company s average worldwide realized crude oil sales price increased in  while the average realized sales price for north american natural gas decreased 
the higher earnings in versus were due to a higher average realized oil sales price  a higher average realized sales price for natural gas in north america  a increase in worldwide oil sales volumes from continuing operations  and higher gains on sale of mature properties 
these favorable variances were somewhat offset by an lower volume of natural gas sales from continuing operations  higher exploration expenses  higher production and depreciation expenses  higher insurance and repair costs after hurricanes katrina and rita and lower income tax benefits in malaysia 
the period included a million after tax gain on sale of most oil and gas properties on the continental shelf of the gulf of mexico 
higher oil production in was primarily caused by a full year of production at 
table of contents the front runner field in the deepwater gulf of mexico and higher heavy oil production from the seal area in western canada in response to an ongoing development drilling program 
natural gas sales volume declined in versus mostly due to the sale of properties on the gulf of mexico continental shelf and more downtime in the gulf of mexico caused by hurricane shut in and repairs 
the results of operations for oil and gas producing activities for each of the last three years are shown by major operating areas on pages f and f of this form k report 
average daily production and sales rates and weighted average sales prices are shown on page of the annual report 
a summary of oil and gas revenues from continuing operations  including intersegment sales that are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements  is presented in the following table 
millions of dollars united states oil and gas liquids natural gas canada conventional oil and gas liquids natural gas synthetic oil united kingdom oil and gas liquids natural gas malaysia crude oil ecuador crude oil total oil and gas revenues the company s crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids production from continuing operations averaged  barrels per day in   barrels per day in and  barrels per day in production of crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids was lower in compared to primarily due to lower volumes produced in the us gulf of mexico and offshore eastern canada 
us oil production of  barrels per day in was down by from levels 
the reduction in the us related to lower volumes at two deepwater fields in the gulf of mexico front runner and habanero and oil volumes produced in from fields on the continental shelf that were sold in the middle of that year 
front runner has experienced a series of well failures that require intervention work 
habanero production decreased due to decline at the most productive onstream well during us oil production in was virtually unaffected by downtime for tropical storms and hurricanes  while volumes were adversely affected by downtime associated with hurricanes katrina and rita 
production offshore the east coast of canada comes from two fields hibernia and terra nova 
terra nova was off production for about one half of for major equipment repairs 
the floating production  storage and offloading vessel was taken to europe for turnaround and production restarted in mid november production at terra nova was  barrels per day in  down from levels 
production at hibernia totaled  barrels per day  which was below  with the decline due primarily to more downtime for equipment reliability issues in total heavy oil production in the western canadian sedimentary basin wcsb increased in and totaled  barrels per day 
this increase was attributable to an ongoing development drilling program during at the seal field in alberta 
light oil production in the wcsb fell to barrels per day in mostly due to less condensate produced at the rimbey gas field in alberta 
synthetic oil production at syncrude increased in and was  barrels per day 
a third coker unit was started up during  and the new unit permits a larger volume of bitumen to be processed at the plant 
the new coker experienced various start up issues  but was operating near capacity at year end all oil production in malaysia during came from the west patricia and adjoining congkak fields in block sk offshore sarawak 
net oil production from malaysia was  barrels per day in  lower than in as the production sharing contract allocates a smaller portion of gross production to the company s account in both a higher price environment and as prior costs are recovered 
gross production volumes at the malaysian fields fell only in a major oil field known as kikeh in block k offshore sabah  malaysia is scheduled to start up in the second half of oil production offshore the united kingdom fell to  barrels per day 
the most significant uk decline in occurred at the schiehallion field and was primarily caused by a fire at the facilities used by this field 
total net oil produced at block in ecuador was  barrels per day in  a increase from as a development drilling campaign continued in oil sales volumes in ecuador significantly exceeded production in due to recovering  barrels of oil for sale in settlement of a dispute with partners over oil production that was originally withheld from the company 

table of contents oil production in was an annual record for murphy oil 
the increase in worldwide oil production in compared to was primarily due to higher volumes in the united states  malaysia and canada 
us oil production was higher in and totaled  barrels per day  with the increase mostly due to a full year of production from the front runner field in the deepwater gulf of mexico at green canyon blocks the first well at front runner came on stream in december and additional wells were completed and started up during and into early production in the us was hampered during by the effects of hurricanes as minor damages to the company s medusa and habanero facilities and damages to product evacuation lines and other facilities downstream caused shut in of production for up to three months 
production offshore sarawak  malaysia at the west patricia and congkak fields increased in to  barrels per day 
the increase was mostly due to a increase in gross production from these fields  but this was partially offset by a lower revenue sharing percentage for the company under the terms of the production sharing contract 
heavy oil production in canada essentially doubled to  barrels per day in due to an ongoing development drilling program in the seal area and a full year of production from wells acquired in late in this area 
production at the hibernia field off the east coast of canada was down to  barrels per day and production at the terra nova field in this area was off in and amounted to  barrels per day 
lower production at terra nova was primarily caused by more downtime for equipment maintenance and repairs and a higher royalty rate 
production of synthetic oil at syncrude netted the company  barrels per day in  down from due to more downtime for equipment repairs 
total oil production offshore the united kingdom was  barrels per day in  down 
about  barrels per day of this decline was attributable to the sale of the t block field in the majority of the remaining decline was at the schiehallion field where a fire and other operational issues reduced average net production volumes by about  barrels per day 
production in ecuador was  barrels per day in  up from oil sales volumes in ecuador in were significantly higher than production volumes due to receiving  barrels of oil for sale in settlement of a dispute with the operator of block worldwide sales of natural gas from continuing operations were million cubic feet per day in  million in and million in sales of natural gas in the united states were million cubic feet per day in  million in and million in the reduced us natural gas sales volume in of was attributable to a combination of lower volumes produced onshore south louisiana due to field decline and volumes produced in at gulf of mexico continental shelf fields that were sold in mid the seventeen hands field in mississippi canyon block came onstream in  and volumes from this field served to essentially offset lower volumes at other deepwater gulf of mexico fields  including tahoe  front runner and habanero 
us natural gas sales volumes in were virtually unaffected by downtime for tropical storms and hurricanes  while volumes in were adversely affected by downtime associated with hurricanes katrina and rita 
natural gas sales volumes in canada were million cubic feet per day in  million in and million in the reduction in natural gas sales volumes in western canada in was mostly caused by normal field decline in the rimbey area 
natural gas sales volumes in the united kingdom in were million cubic feet per day  while and volumes were million and million  respectively 
the decline of for natural gas sales volumes in the uk was wholly attributable to make up gas volumes sold in at the amethyst field that were associated with under sold production in earlier years 
excluding the make up volumes in  uk natural gas sales volumes in would have exceeded amounts 
natural gas sales volume declined by in the us in due to the sale of most properties on the continental shelf of the gulf of mexico in mid  which caused a decrease of million cubic feet per day  and the effects of hurricane katrina and other gulf of mexico storms that caused shut ins that reduced production by an average of about million cubic feet per day for the year 
these were partially offset by higher volumes due to ramp up of production at the front runner field throughout sales volumes in were unfavorably affected by hurricane ivan which temporarily shut in most production in the central gulf of mexico and severely damaged certain facilities  such as at the tahoe field in viosca knoll block  which was shut in for the entire fourth quarter following the storm 
canadian gas sales volumes decreased in compared to mostly due to normal field decline at rimbey area wells 
uk natural gas sales volumes in were up with most of the increase due to higher sales volumes at the amethyst field primarily caused by make up gas sold in that related to a prior year s contract 
worldwide crude oil sales prices have risen in each of the last two years due to the combination of a strong world economy  real and perceived instability in worldwide crude oil production levels  and effective production output controls by opec producers 
the company realized an average per barrel sales price of for crude oil and condensate in  up from the average of per barrel 
the average realized oil sales price in in the us was up at per barrel 
the average sales price of canadian heavy oil was per barrel  also a increase compared to realized average prices per barrel for hibernia and terra nova oil sales in were and  respectively  with each up about from averages 
synthetic oil production was sold at per barrel in  up from prices 
the realized sales price for synthetic oil did not rise as much as other oil because of higher volumes of similar crudes available in the market for which demand did not keep pace with the growth 
average 
table of contents crude oil prices in malaysia of per barrel in was higher than  while uk prices for the latest year rose to per barrel 
the average oil price realized in ecuador of per barrel rose only from as the ecuadorian government passed a revenue sharing law that became effective in april oil producers in ecuador must now revenue share of average realized prices that exceed a benchmark price that escalates with the inflation rate as measured monthly by the us consumer price index 
at year end  this benchmark oil price for block ecuador was approximately per barrel 
murphy realized an average worldwide crude oil and condensate sales price of per barrel in  a increase from the realized average price of per barrel 
the average realized price in for crude oil and condensate sold in the us was per barrel  an increase of over the average price for canadian heavy oil sales was per barrel  up from  and was adversely affected by higher costs of diluent and a wider heavy oil discount in the year 
the average selling price in for hibernia and terra nova production offshore eastern canada was per barrel  an increase of 
the synthetic oil production sales price rose in and averaged per barrel 
sales prices in for uk north sea oil was up to per barrel 
ecuador sales prices averaged per barrel in and malaysia prices were per barrel  these prices increased and  respectively 
malaysian prices were unfavorably affected by price sharing payments required in periods of high oil prices in accordance with the terms of the production sharing contract for block sk north american natural gas sale prices did not rise in tandem with higher crude oil prices in as us natural gas storage levels exceeded normal levels during most of the year  primarily due to milder average temperature across much of the us during the period 
north american gas sales prices averaged per thousand cubic feet mcf in  down from averages 
the sales price for natural gas in the uk was up and averaged per mcf 
the sales prices for natural gas in the company s gas producing markets were stronger than in the company s sales price of north american natural gas averaged per mcf in  an increase of from in the uk  the average sales price for natural gas was per mcf  up from based on sales volumes and deducting taxes at marginal rates  each per barrel and per mcf fluctuation in prices would have affected earnings from exploration and production operations by million and million  respectively 
the effect of these price fluctuations on consolidated net income cannot be measured precisely because operating results of the company s refining and marketing segments could be affected differently 
production expenses were million in  million in and million in these amounts are shown by major operating area on pages f and f of this form k report 
costs per equivalent barrel excluding discontinued operations during the last three years are shown in the following table 
dollars per equivalent barrel united states canada excluding synthetic oil synthetic oil united kingdom malaysia ecuador worldwide excluding synthetic oil production cost per equivalent barrel increased in the united states in mostly due to higher insurance costs coupled with lower overall production 
the lower cost per equivalent barrel in the us in was primarily due to start up of the front runner field in late and sale of higher cost properties in the gulf of mexico in mid the per unit costs for canadian conventional oil and gas operations  excluding syncrude  rose significantly in due to lower production volumes and higher repair costs at terra nova  which was shut in for about six months for major equipment repairs  plus a higher mix of more costly heavy oil production versus lighter oils 
the increase in costs in canada excluding synthetic oil in was due to a growing heavy oil production profile  lower production volume at the terra nova field and a higher foreign exchange rate 
higher production costs per barrel for synthetic oil operations in were mostly attributable to higher coker repair costs and higher compensation costs 
the higher rate per barrel for canadian synthetic oil operations in compared to was due to unfavorable maintenance  energy and compensation costs coupled with lower production and a higher foreign exchange rate 
higher costs per barrel produced in the uk and malaysia were mostly attributable to higher facility maintenance costs 
the higher average uk cost in was mostly due to higher maintenance costs and lower production at the schiehallion and mungo monan fields 
the increase in the unit rate in 
table of contents malaysia in was due to higher fuel and export duty costs 
higher per unit operating costs in ecuador in compared to were mostly attributable to higher field operating costs in the amazon region where block is located 
lower average costs per barrel in ecuador in were due mostly to a new  less expensive arrangement for pipeline transportation that began near year end exploration expenses for each of the last three years are shown in total in the following table  and amounts are reported by major operating area on pages f and f on this form k report 
certain of the expenses are included in the capital expenditures total for exploration and production activities 
millions of dollars exploration and production dry holes geological and geophysical other undeveloped lease amortization total exploration expenses dry holes expense was million lower in than mostly due to less unsuccessful wildcat drilling in the republic of congo in the current year  but partially offset by higher unsuccessful drilling costs in the us gulf of mexico 
dry hole expense was up million in compared to as dry hole costs offshore the republic of congo and malaysia were only partially offset by lower costs in the deepwater gulf of mexico and offshore eastern canada 
geological and geophysical g g expenses in were about the same as in as higher current year costs in the gulf of mexico were essentially offset by lower spending offshore eastern canada 
g g expenses were higher by million in compared to mostly due to more d seismic acquisition and processing costs in blocks sk and pm  offshore malaysia 
other exploration costs in were million higher than in mostly due to higher administrative costs for international exploration activities 
other exploration expenses were million higher in than in due mostly to more administrative costs in the republic of congo 
undeveloped leasehold amortization expense in was virtually flat with  while such costs increased by million in compared to because of lease acquisitions in the gulf of mexico  a lease relinquishment in the gulf of mexico in and the acquisition in of two exploration concessions in the deep waters offshore the republic of congo 
costs of million  million and million were incurred in  and  respectively  in the company s exploration and production operations for uninsured costs to repair damages and to recognize associated higher insurance costs caused by hurricanes in the gulf of mexico 
in  these costs were adversely affected by hurricanes katrina and rita  and also included discretionary assistance to employees in the new orleans area after hurricane katrina 
in  the company also recorded costs of million for retrospective insurance premiums related to past claims experience of an insurance provider 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense related to exploration and production operations totaled million in  million in and million in the million reduction in compared to was attributable to lower oil and natural gas sales volumes in the current year  but partially offset by generally higher per barrel capital amortization caused by higher costs for development operations and negative us reserve revisions 
the million increase in versus was due to more crude oil production and higher per barrel costs in most areas generally caused by higher capital costs incurred to find and develop oil and natural gas reserves 
despite a weakening of oil prices in early  the company continues to experience high drilling and related costs caused by a strong demand for such services 
the exploration and production business recorded expenses of million in  million in and million in for accretion on discounted abandonment liabilities 
because the abandonment liabilities are carried on the balance sheet at a discounted fair value  accretion must be recorded annually so that the liability will be recorded at full value at the projected time of abandonment 
the higher accretion costs incurred in were mostly associated with retirement obligations incurred on development wells drilled at the kikeh field during the effective income tax rate for exploration and production operations was in  in and in although the effective tax rate was only slightly higher than the us statutory tax rate of  the annual rate was lower than in mostly due to net benefits from tax rate changes 
in the canadian federal government and the alberta and saskatchewan provinces reduced their tax rates on oil and gas company profits  which led to a recognition of tax benefits of million in mostly due to reducing recorded deferred income tax liabilities 
in 
table of contents  the uk government increased tax rates on oil and gas company profits from to  which increased income tax expense in the uk by million in the effective tax rate in was higher than the average us statutory rate due to unrecognized income tax benefits on certain exploration and other expenses in malaysia and the republic of congo 
each main exploration area in malaysia is currently ring fenced and no tax benefits have thus far been recognized for costs incurred for blocks h  p  l and m  offshore sabah  and blocks pm  offshore peninsula malaysia 
the effective tax rate in was lower than the us statutory rate partially due to recognition of deferred income tax benefits in malaysia of million  which arose due to the expectation that temporary differences associated with exploration and other expenses incurred in block k malaysia will be utilized to reduce future taxable income 
this benefit had not been recognized in the income statement before because the company had established a deferred tax valuation allowance until such time that it became probable that these expenses would be utilized as deductions to reduce future taxable income 
in the province of alberta reduced its tax rate for oil and gas companies which generated a million benefit in that year 
at december   approximately of the company s us proved oil reserves and of the us proved natural gas reserves are undeveloped 
virtually all of the total us undeveloped reserves on a barrel of oil equivalent basis are associated with the company s various deepwater gulf of mexico fields 
further drilling  facility construction and well workovers are required to move undeveloped reserves to developed 
in addition in malaysia  all oil and natural gas reserves of million barrels and billion cubic feet at year end for the kikeh field in block k are undeveloped pending completion of facilities and development drilling prior to first production  which is projected to occur in the second half of for oil and in early for natural gas 
also in malaysia  there were billion cubic feet of undeveloped natural gas reserves at various fields offshore sarawak at year end  pending completion of drilling and facilities 
first gas production at these sarawak fields is expected in the first half of on a worldwide basis  the company spent approximately million in  million in and million in to develop proved reserves

refining and marketing the company s refining and marketing r m operations generated earnings of million in  million in and million in the decline in earnings during the current year was primarily due to hurricane related after tax costs of million and lower crude oil throughput volumes at the meraux  louisiana refinery 
in late august  the meraux refinery experienced severe flooding and wind damage associated with hurricane katrina and was shut down from late august through mid the hurricane related costs in were partially offset by stronger refining margins generated by the superior  wisconsin refinery and continued growth in the company s north american retail gasoline marketing activities 
in  r m earnings increased compared to in north america  earnings improved mostly due to stronger marketing margins  while in the uk income improved due to stronger margins in both refining and marketing

significant flooding and wind damage associated with hurricane katrina resulted in the refinery being shut down from late august through mid during the refinery s nine months of downtime  major upgrades and improvements were completed in conjunction with the hurricane related repairs  including turnarounds on the refinery s hydrocracker and fluid catalytic cracking unit debutanizer 
meraux refinery throughput volumes increased to approximately  barrels per day following the debutanizer turnaround in december the company s refinery in superior  wisconsin generated record earnings for the year as a result of steady operations and the continued strength of industry refining margins in north america 
the operating results for the company s north american retail operations remained strong  with higher average fuel and non fuel sales volumes at its retail sites as well as continued additions to the number of stations in operation 
retail fuel sales volumes increased in compared to fuel sales volumes in the company increased the size of its retail gasoline operations in by adding murphy usa fueling stations in the parking lots of wal mart supercenters in a state area 
this resulted in a increase in the number of sites at year end compared to 
table of contents operating results for the company s refining business in were slightly better than during the first eight months of the company benefited from strong industry refining margins due to increased demand for gasoline and distillates fueled by the robust us economy 
higher refinery margins for both the meraux and superior refineries were mostly offset by the effects of four months of lost production and million of after tax hurricane related costs at the meraux refinery following hurricane katrina 
operating results for the north american retail gasoline marketing operations were stronger in compared to due to a combination of higher per gallon fuel margins  higher average per site fuel and non fuel sales volumes and the continued addition of sites

the primary sources of the company s liquidity are internally generated funds  access to outside financing and working capital 
the company uses its internally generated funds to finance the major portion of its capital and other expenditures  and maintains lines of credit with banks and borrows as necessary to meet spending requirements

the company s ratio of earnings to fixed charges was to in  to in and to in environmental murphy and other companies in the oil and gas industry are subject to numerous federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations 
the most significant of those laws and the corresponding regulations affecting the company s operations are the us clean air act  which regulates air emissions the us clean water act  which regulates discharges into us waters the us comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  which addresses liability for hazardous substance releases the us federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra  which regulates the handling and disposal of solid wastes the us federal oil pollution act of opa  which addresses liability for discharges of oil into navigable waters of the united states the us safe drinking water act  which regulates disposal of wastewater into underground wells regulations of the us department of the interior governing offshore oil and gas operations these laws and their associated regulations establish limits on emissions and standards for quality of water discharges 
they also generally require permits for new or modified operations 
many states and foreign countries where murphy operates also have or are developing similar statutes and regulations governing air and water  which in some cases impose or could impose additional and more stringent requirements 
murphy is also subject to certain acts and regulations primarily governing remediation of wastes or oil spills 

table of contents cercla  commonly referred to as the superfund act and comparable state statutes  primarily addresses historic contamination and imposes joint and several liability for cleanup of contaminated sites on owners and operators of the sites 
as discussed below  murphy is involved in a limited number of superfund sites 
cercla also requires reporting of releases to the environment of substances defined as hazardous 
rcra and comparable state statutes govern the management and disposal of wastes  with the most stringent regulations applicable to treatment  storage or disposal of hazardous wastes at the owner s property 
under opa  owners and operators of tankers  owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines  and lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located are liable for removal and cleanup costs of oil discharges into navigable waters of the united states 
the us environmental protection agency epa has issued several standards applicable to the formulation of motor fuels  primarily related to the level of sulfur found in highway diesel and gasoline  which are designed to reduce emissions of certain air pollutants when the fuel enters commerce or is used 
several states have passed similar or more stringent regulations governing the formulation of motor fuels 
the epa s mandated requirements for low sulfur gasoline are effective in and both of the company s us refineries have been expanded and are now capable of producing the required low sulfur gasoline 
each of the us refineries must begin to produce the epa required ultra low sulfur diesel ulsd beginning in the meraux refinery is currently capable of producing this ulsd for approximately half of its diesel production  but the superior refinery is not yet capable of meeting the ulsd standard 
the company s management is currently studying alternatives available for fully meeting this ulsd standard at meraux and superior 
world leaders have held numerous discussions about the level of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions 
as part of these discussions  a kyoto agreement was adopted in that has been ratified by certain countries in which the company operates or may operate in the future  with the united states being the primary country that has yet to ratify the agreement 
the us may ratify all or a portion of the agreement in the future 
the agreement became effective for ratifying countries in early and these countries are in various stages of developing regulations to address its contents 
the company is unable to predict how final regulations associated with the agreement will impact its costs in future years  but it is reasonable to expect these regulations to increase its compliance costs to some degree 
the company is also involved in personal injury and property damage claims  allegedly caused by exposure to or by the release or disposal of materials manufactured or used in the company s operations 
the company operates or has previously operated certain sites and facilities  including three refineries  five terminals  and approximately service stations  for which known or potential obligations for environmental remediation exist 
in addition the company operates or has operated numerous oil and gas fields that may require some form of remediation 
under the company s accounting policies  an environmental liability is recorded when such an obligation is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
if there is a range of reasonably estimated costs  the most likely amount will be recorded  or if no amount is most likely  the minimum of the range is used 
recorded liabilities are reviewed quarterly 
actual cash expenditures often occur one or more years after a liability is recognized 
the company s liability for remedial obligations includes certain amounts that are based on anticipated regulatory approval for proposed remediation of former refinery waste sites 
although regulatory authorities may require more costly alternatives than the proposed processes  the cost of such potential alternative processes is not expected to exceed the accrued liability by a material amount 
the epa currently considers the company to be a potentially responsible party prp at two superfund sites 
the potential total cost to all parties to perform necessary remedial work at these sites may be substantial 
based on currently available information  the company believes that it is a de minimis party as to ultimate responsibility at both superfund sites 
the company has not recorded a liability for remedial costs on superfund sites 
the company could be required to bear a pro rata share of costs attributable to nonparticipating prps or could be assigned additional responsibility for remediation at the two sites or other superfund sites 
the company believes that its share of the ultimate costs to clean up the two superfund sites will be immaterial and will not have a material adverse effect on its net income  financial condition or liquidity in a future period 
there is the possibility that environmental expenditures could be required at currently unidentified sites  and new or revised regulations could require additional expenditures at known sites 
however  based on information currently available to the company  the amount of future remediation costs incurred at known or currently unidentified sites is not expected to have a material adverse effect on net income  financial condition or liquidity in a future period 

table of contents certain environmental expenditures are likely to be recovered by the company from other sources  primarily environmental funds maintained by certain states 
since no assurance can be given that future recoveries from other sources will occur  the company has not recorded a benefit for likely recoveries at december  the company s refineries also incur costs to handle and dispose of hazardous waste and other chemical substances 
the types of waste and substances disposed of generally fall into the following categories spent catalysts usually hydrotreating catalysts  spent used filter media  tank bottoms and api separator sludge  contaminated soils  laboratory and maintenance spent solvents  and various industrial debris 
the costs of disposing of these substances are expensed as incurred and amounted to million in in addition to these expenses  murphy allocates a portion of its capital expenditure program to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
such capital expenditures were approximately million in and are projected to be million in other matters impact of inflation general inflation was moderate during the last three years in most countries where the company operates  however  the company s revenues and capital and operating costs are influenced to a larger extent by specific price changes in the oil and gas and allied industries than by changes in general inflation 
crude oil and petroleum product prices generally reflect the balance between supply and demand  with crude oil prices being particularly sensitive to opec production levels and or attitudes of traders concerning supply and demand in the near future 
natural gas prices are affected by supply and demand  which to a significant extent are affected by the weather and by the fact that delivery of gas is generally restricted to specific geographic areas 
because crude oil and natural gas sales prices have generally strengthened during the last several years  prices for oil field goods and services have risen with certain of these price increases such as drilling rig day rates having been significant  and prices could continue to be adversely affected in the future 
due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices  it is not possible to determine what effect these prices will have on the future cost of oil field goods and services  although the company anticipates continued escalation in prices for certain equipment and services as long as oil prices remain strong

this statement was adopted by the company on january  and it did not have a significant impact on the company s results of operations 

table of contents in september  the eitf decided in issue  accounting for purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty  that two or more exchange transactions involving inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another should be combined for purposes of evaluating the effect of apb opinion  accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
additionally  the eitf decided that a nonmonetary exchange where an entity transfers finished goods inventory in exchange for the receipt of raw materials or work in progress inventory within the same line of business should generally be recognized by the entity at fair value

the company s synthetic oil operation at syncrude is affected by this ruling  which was effective as of january  for the company 
the company has determined that the level of bitumen inventory at syncrude affected by this eitf consensus is immaterial and it has continued to expense post production stripping costs as incurred 
in september  the fasb issued fsp aug air which prohibits  effective january   the use of the accrue in advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities as historically used by the company 
accordingly  the company will elect to use the deferral method for accounting for planned major maintenance activities beginning in under the deferral method  the actual cost of each planned major maintenance activity is deferred and amortized through the next turnaround 
upon adoption in the accrued major repair costs reported on the consolidated balance sheets will be replaced by a non current asset representing the net unamortized major maintenance cost at the end of each reporting period and this accounting change is expected to cause a one time increase to retained earnings of the company 
all prior periods financial statements presented will be retrospectively restated upon adoption of this new standard 
the company is currently evaluating this fsp and has estimated the one time after tax credit to retained earnings to be approximately million

other murphy holds a interest in block ecuador  where the company and its partners produce oil for export 
in  the local tax authorities announced that value added taxes vat paid on goods and services related to block and many oil fields held by other companies will no longer be reimbursed 
in response to this announcement  oil producers filed actions in the ecuador tax court seeking determination that the vat in question is reimbursable 
in july  international arbitrators ruled that vat was recoverable by another oil company  but the state of ecuador responded that it was not bound by this arbitral decision 
as of december   the company had a receivable of approximately million related to vat 
in early  ecuadorian authorities settled this issue with the company by agreeing to assign a portion of the government s future oil volumes to the block partners 
the settlement had no material impact on the company s financial position or net income 
significant accounting policies in preparing the company s consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  management must make a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reporting of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
application of certain of the company s accounting policies requires significant estimates 
the most significant of these accounting policies are described below 

table of contents proved oil and natural gas reserves proved reserves are defined by the us securities and exchange commission sec as those volumes of crude oil  condensate  natural gas liquids and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
proved developed reserves are volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
although the company s engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves as established by the sec  the estimation of reserves requires the engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment 
sec rules require that year end oil and natural gas prices must be used for determining proved reserve quantities 
year end prices usually do not approximate the average price that the company expects to receive for its oil and natural gas production 
the company often uses significantly different oil and natural gas price and reserve assumptions when making its own internal economic property evaluations 
estimated reserves are subject to future revision  certain of which could be substantial  based on the availability of additional information  including reservoir performance  new geological and geophysical data  additional drilling  technological advancements  price changes and other economic factors 
changes in oil and natural gas prices can lead to a decision to start up or shut in production  which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities 
reserve revisions inherently lead to adjustments of the company s depreciation rates and the timing of settlement of asset retirement obligations 
the company s proved reserves of oil and natural gas are presented on pages f and f of the annual report 
the oil reserve revisions in in the us  canada and ecuador were based on performance of various local wells 
the reserve revision in malaysia in was mostly due to extension of proved oil in the kikeh reservoir 
the us oil reserve revision in was mostly due to poor well performance at the deepwater front runner field 
oil reserve revisions in in canada  the uk and ecuador were due to better field performance  while the malaysia revision was caused by higher oil prices that reduce volumes allocable to the company for cost recovery under production sharing contracts 
the reserve revision for us oil in related primarily to loss of royalty relief for the medusa and front runner deepwater fields based on year end oil prices 
oil reserve revisions in canada in related to a combination of low heavy oil prices at year end that restricted economic recoverability of certain heavy oil reserves and higher projected royalties at the terra nova and hibernia fields 
oil reserve revisions in ecuador in were caused by a higher than previously estimated water cut in the liquid stream produced at block downward revisions to us natural gas reserves in were mostly caused by unfavorable production performance for gas wells at various fields in the gulf of mexico and onshore south louisiana 
the significant upward revision of natural gas reserves in malaysia in related to gas associated with the kikeh field that will be sold to the local government beginning in natural gas reserve revisions were positive in the us in due to better well performance 
the company cannot predict the type of reserve revisions that will be required in future periods 
successful efforts accounting the company utilizes the successful efforts method to account for exploration and development expenditures 
unsuccessful exploration wells are expensed and can have a significant effect on net income 
successful exploration drilling costs  all development capital expenditures and asset retirement costs are capitalized and systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved developed oil and natural gas reserves as estimated by the company s engineers 
in some cases  a determination of whether a drilled well has found proved reserves can not be made immediately 
this is generally due to the need for a major capital expenditure to produce and or evacuate the hydrocarbon s found 
the determination of whether to make such a capital expenditure is  in turn  usually dependent on whether additional exploratory wells find a sufficient quantity of additional reserves 
under current accounting rules  the company holds well costs in property  plant and equipment in the consolidated balance sheet when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project 
costs for one exploration well in progress at year end amounted to million 
through february  the well was determined to have successfully found hydrocarbon deposits and will be further evaluated for commerciality 
other wells in progress at year end were insignificant 
based on the time required to complete further exploration and appraisal drilling in areas where hydrocarbons have been found but proved reserves have not been booked  dry hole expense may be recorded one or more years after the original drilling costs are incurred 
dry hole expenses related to prior year well costs were million in and million in  there were no dry holes in that were drilled in prior years 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets the company continually monitors its long lived assets recorded in property  plant and equipment and goodwill in the consolidated balance sheet to make sure that they are fairly presented 
the company must evaluate its properties for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset could exceed its fair value 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events 
such events include a projection of future oil and natural gas sales prices  an estimate of the amount of oil and natural gas that will be produced from a field  the timing of this future production  future costs to produce the oil and natural gas  future capital and abandonment costs  future margins on refined products produced and sold  and future inflation levels 
the need to test a property for impairment can be based on several factors  including but not limited to a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and or natural gas  unfavorable reserve revisions  expected deterioration of future refining and or marketing margins for refined products  or other changes to contracts  environmental regulations or tax laws 
all of these same factors must be considered when evaluating a property s carrying value for possible impairment 
in making its impairment assessments involving exploration and production property and equipment  the company must make a number of projections involving future oil and natural gas sales prices  future production volumes  and future capital and operating costs 
due to the volatility of world oil and gas markets  the actual sales prices for oil and natural gas have often been quite different from the company s projections 
estimates of future oil and gas production and sales volumes are based on a combination of proved and risked probable and possible reserves 
although the estimation of reserves and future production is uncertain  the company believes that its estimates are reasonable  however  there have been cases where actual production volumes were higher or lower than projected and the timing was different than the original projection 
the company adjusts reserves and production estimates as new information becomes available 
the company generally projects future costs by using historical costs adjusted for both assumed long term inflation rates and known or expected changes in future operations 
although the projected future costs are considered to be reasonable  at times  costs have been higher or lower than originally estimated 
in assessing potential impairment involving refining and marketing assets  the company evaluates its properties when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset could exceed its fair value 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events  which include projections of future margins  future capital expenditures and future operating expenses 
future marketing or operating decisions  such as closing or selling certain assets  and future regulatory or tax changes could also impact the company s conclusion about potential asset impairment 
although the company does not believe it had any significant properties with carrying values that were impaired at december   one or a combination of factors such as significantly lower future sales prices  significantly lower future production  significantly higher future costs  or significantly lower future margins on refining and marketing sales could lead to impairment expenses in future periods 
based on these unknown future factors as described herein  the company can not predict the amount or timing of impairment expenses that may be recorded in the future 
income taxes the company is subject to income and other similar taxes in all areas in which it operates 
when recording income tax expense  certain estimates are required because a income tax returns are generally filed months after the close of its annual accounting period  b tax returns are subject to audit by taxing authorities and audits can often take years to complete and settle  and c future events often impact the timing of when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized by the company 
the company has deferred tax assets mostly relating to property basis differences and liabilities for future repairs  dismantlements and retirement benefits 
the company routinely evaluates all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of their realization 
a valuation allowance has been recognized for deferred tax assets related to basis differences for blocks h  pm  p  l and m in malaysia  exploration licenses in the republic of congo and certain basis differences in the uk due to management s belief that these assets cannot be deemed to be realizable with any degree of confidence at this time 
the company occasionally is challenged by taxing authorities over the amount and or timing of recognition of revenues and deductions in its various income tax returns 
although the company believes that it has adequate accruals for matters not resolved with various taxing authorities  gains or losses could occur in future years from changes in estimates or resolution of outstanding matters 
accounting for retirement and postretirement benefit plans murphy oil and certain of its subsidiaries maintain defined benefit retirement plans covering most of its full time employees 
the company also sponsors health care and life insurance benefit plans covering most retired us employees 
the expense associated with these plans is determined by management based on a number of assumptions and with consultation assistance from qualified third party actuaries 
the most important of these assumptions for the retirement plans involve the discount rate used to measure future plan obligations and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
for the retiree medical and insurance plans  the most important assumptions are the discount rate for future plan obligations and the health care 
table of contents cost trend rate 
discount rates are adjusted as necessary  generally based on changes in aa rated corporate bond rates 
expected plan asset returns are based on long term expectations for asset portfolios with similar investment mix characteristics 
anticipated health care cost trend rates are determined based on prior experience of the company and an assessment of near term and long term trends for medical and drug costs 
based on higher bond yields during  the company has increased the primary plans discount rate from in to in and beyond 
although the company presently assumes a return on plan assets of for the primary plan  it periodically reconsiders the appropriateness of this and other key assumptions 
the smoothing effect of current accounting regulations tends to buffer the current year s pension expense from wide swings in liabilities and asset returns 
the company s normal annual retirement and postretirement plan expenses are estimated to increase slightly in compared to as the effects from a growing employee base will not fully offset the effects of a higher discount rate 
in  the company paid million into various retirement plans and million into postretirement plans 
in  the company is expecting to fund payments of approximately million into various retirement plans and million for postretirement plans 
the company could be required to make additional and more significant funding payments to retirement plans in future years 
future required payments and the amount of liabilities recorded on the balance sheet associated with the plans could be unfavorably affected if the discount rate declines  the actual return on plan assets falls below the assumed  or the health care cost trend rate increase is higher than expected 
as described above  the company s retirement and postretirement expenses are sensitive to certain assumptions  primarily related to discount rates and assumed return on plan assets 
a decline in the discount rate would increase annual retirement and postretirement expenses by million and million  respectively  and a decline in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would increase retirement expense by million 
legal  environmental and other contingent matters a provision for legal  environmental and other contingent matters is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
judgment is often required to determine when expenses should be recorded for legal  environmental and other contingent matters 
in addition  the company often must estimate the amount of such losses 
in many cases  management s judgment is based on interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or courts of law 
the company s management closely monitors known and potential legal  environmental and other contingent matters  and makes its best estimate of the amount of losses and when they should be recorded based on information available to the company 
contractual obligations and guarantees the company is obligated to make future cash payments under borrowing arrangements  operating leases  purchase obligations primarily associated with existing capital expenditure commitments  and other long term liabilities 
in addition  the company expects to extend certain operating leases beyond the minimum contractual period 
total payments due after under such contractual obligations and arrangements are shown below 
amount of obligation millions of dollars total after total debt including current maturities operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total a floating  production  storage and offloading fpso vessel is currently being built by other companies and it is anticipated to be used in producing the kikeh field in block k malaysia  which is scheduled to start up production in the second half of the company will lease this fpso subject to satisfactory completion of construction by its owners 
certain amounts to be paid after by the company prior to completion of the fpso construction period totaling million have been included in the contractual obligation table above in if the fpso is accepted by the company in  future undiscounted lease commitments will amount to million  these amounts have not been included in the contractual obligation table above pending successful construction of the fpso 
accounting treatment for this lease will be determined upon satisfactory delivery of the fpso 
in addition  the company has entered into an agreement  subject to successful completion of construction  to lease a production facility for the thunder hawk field in mississippi canyon block no amounts are payable by the company prior to the successful completion of construction of this facility 

table of contents in the normal course of its business  the company is required under certain contracts with various governmental authorities and others to provide financial guarantees or letters of credit that may be drawn upon if the company fails to perform under those contracts 
the amount of commitments as of december  that expire in future periods is shown below 
amount of commitment millions of dollars total after financial guarantees letters of credit total material off balance sheet arrangements the company occasionally utilizes off balance sheet arrangements for operational or funding purposes 
the most significant of these arrangements at year end involves an oil and natural gas processing contract and a hydrogen purchase contract 
the processing contract provides crude oil and natural gas processing capacity for oil and natural gas production from the medusa field in the gulf of mexico 
under the contract  the company pays a specified amount per barrel of oil equivalent for processing its oil and natural gas through the facility 
if actual oil and natural gas production processed through the facility through is less than a specified quantity  the company must make additional quarterly payments up to an agreed minimum level that varies over time 
through  actual production from the medusa field has exceeded the contractual minimum volumes 
the company has a contract to purchase hydrogen for the meraux refinery through the contract requires a monthly minimum base facility charge whether or not any hydrogen is purchased 
payments under both these agreements are recorded as operating expenses when paid 
future required minimum annual payments under both of these arrangements are included in the contractual obligation table shown on the previous page 
outlook prices for the company s primary products are often quite volatile 
a strong global economy  which fueled demand for oil and natural gas  led to strong prices for these products during and due to the volatility of worldwide crude oil and north american natural gas prices  routine monitoring of spending plans is required 
the company s capital expenditure budget for was prepared during the fall of and based on this budget capital expenditures are expected to increase over capital expenditures in are projected to total billion 
of this amount  billion or about  is allocated for the exploration and production program 
geographically  e p capital is spread approximately as follows for the united states  for malaysia  for canada and for all other areas 
spending in the us is primarily associated with continued development of producing deepwater fields and the thunder hawk field  which is anticipated to start up in mid  as well as for the company s gulf of mexico exploration program 
in malaysia  the majority of the spending is for continued development of the kikeh field in block k  where first oil is anticipated in the second half of  and for development of natural gas fields in blocks sk and offshore sarawak where first production is anticipated in the first half of spending in the republic of congo includes early development costs for the azurite marine discovery offshore 
refining and marketing expenditures in should be about million of which almost is allocated for the us budget  which includes funds for construction of additional retail gasoline stations at wal mart supercenters and other locations and real estate acquisitions near the meraux refinery as part of the settlement of the oil spill litigation 
capital and other expenditures are routinely reviewed and planned capital expenditures may be adjusted to reflect differences between budgeted and actual cash flow during capital expenditures may also be affected by asset purchases  which often are not anticipated at the time the budget is prepared 
the company currently expects to fund certain development costs in  primarily in malaysia at the kikeh field in block k and the gas fields in sarawak  using available credit facilities 
most other funding is anticipated to be generated from operating cash flow 
the company forecasts an increase in long term debt of approximately million in this forecast could change based on actual cash flow generated from operations and actual levels of capital spending 
for example  a significant reduction in sales prices for crude oil and natural gas  without a corresponding decrease in capital spending  could cause the company s long term debt to rise by more than the current forecast 
in early  oil prices weakened compared to prices experienced throughout most of these oil prices  in addition to gas prices  remained close to or above the prices used in the company s budget 
through early  margins for the company s refining and marketing operations were below amounts included in the company s budget 

table of contents the company currently expects production in to average between  and  barrels of oil equivalent per day 
a key assumption in projecting the level of company production is the anticipated start up of oil production at the kikeh field in malaysia in the last half of the kikeh field will ramp up production throughout in addition  continued reliability of facilities at significant non operated fields such as syncrude  hibernia and terra nova are necessary to achieve the anticipated production levels
