general our product lines include sound reinforcement speakers  analog mixers  guitar and bass amplifiers  professional loudspeaker systems  and branded musical instruments 
these products can be found in professional and project recording studios  video and broadcast suites  post production facilities  sound reinforcement applications including churches and nightclubs  retail locations  and on major musical concert tours 
we distribute our products primarily through retail dealers  mail order outlets and installed sound contractors 
we have our primary operations in the united states with smaller operations in the united kingdom  canada  china and japan 
operating results for  which were substantially impacted by restructuring costs incurred during the manufacturing transition to asia and the consolidation of the st 
louis music and service operations  increased million when compared to for the twelve months ended december   net sales increased to million from million for the increase in net sales is primarily related to having a full twelve months of historical st

this compares to net income for of million  or per diluted share  which included a gain on sale of the company s discontinued operations in italy of million net of tax  or per diluted share 
all per share amounts in this report are adjusted to reflect the for reverse stock split that was effective after the close of business on november  critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations following are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters  actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies 
certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances  including the policies for revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation and income taxes 
these policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date 
however  since our business cycle is relatively short  actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six month period following the financial statement date 
thus  these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts 
inventory valuation 
loud inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out method  or market 
included in our inventories are demonstration products used by our sales representatives and marketing department including finished goods that have been shipped to customers for evaluation 
market value adjustments are recorded for excess and obsolete material  slow moving product  service and demonstration products 
we make judgments regarding the carrying value of our 
table of contents inventory based upon current market conditions 
these conditions may change depending upon competitive product introductions  customer demand and other factors 
if the market for our previously released products changes  we may be required to write down the cost of our inventory 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to meet their financial obligations to us 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations 
since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  a larger allowance may be required 
in the event we determine a smaller or larger allowance appropriate  we would record a credit or a charge to selling  general  and administrative expense in the period in which we made such a determination 
long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
significant judgment is used in assessing factors which might trigger impairment including significant underperformance relative to expected operating results  significant changes in our use of the assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
as we continue to review our distribution methods and transition our manufacturing to third parties  this may result in circumstances where the carrying value of certain long lived assets may not be recoverable 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of goodwill on an annual basis  in our fourth quarter  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill relates is less than the carrying value 
a reporting unit is considered to be a brand or group of brands 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following poor economic performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry  economic or company specific trends  changes in the manner of our use of the assets or the plans for our business  and loss of key personnel 
if we were to determine that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying value  including goodwill  based upon the annual test or the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we would measure impairment based on a comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to its assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit 
to the extent the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill  we would record an impairment charge for the difference 
there were no impairments related to goodwill in any of the periods presented 
revenue recognition 
revenues from sales of products  net of sales discounts  returns and allowances  are generally recognized upon shipment under an agreement with a customer when risk of loss has passed to the customer  all significant contractual obligations have been satisfied  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is considered probable 
products are generally shipped fob shipping point with no right of return 
we do have some dealers who finance their purchases through finance companies 
we have a manufacturer s repurchase agreement with the finance companies 
we defer the revenue and related cost of goods sold of these sales at the time of the sale 
we then recognize the revenue and related cost of goods sold of these sales when the right of return no longer exists 
sales with contingencies  such as rights of return  rotation rights  conditional acceptance provisions and price protection  are rare and insignificant 
we generally warrant our products against defects in materials and workmanship for periods of between one and six years  with the exception of alvarez yairi guitars  which have a limited lifetime warranty 
the 
table of contents estimated cost of warranty obligations  sales returns and other allowances are recognized at the time of revenue recognition based on contract terms and prior claims experience 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change this allowance in a period  it may materially impact the tax provision in the statement of operations 
accounting for acquisitions 
significant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of purchased assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition  including estimating future cash flows from the acquired business  determining appropriate discount rates  asset lives and other assumptions 
our process to determine the fair value of trademarks  customer relationships  and developed technology includes the use of estimates including the following the potential impact on operating results of the revenue estimates for customers acquired through the acquisition based on an assumed customer attrition rate  and estimated costs to be incurred to purchase the capabilities gained through the developed technology and appropriate discount rates based on the particular business s weighted average cost of capital 
our process to determine the fair value of inventories acquired was to estimate the selling price of the inventories less the sum of costs to sell and a reasonable selling profit allowance

net cash used in investing activities cash used in investing activities was million in  a decrease from million used in and an increase from million used in the cash used in investing activities in was primarily related to the acquisition of st 
louis music  inc of million 
the decrease is partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures for tooling used by our contract manufacturers 
as part of our contract manufacturing agreements  most of our contract manufacturers require that we invest in tooling equipment prior to the start of manufacturing 
in we anticipate spending on new tooling devices required to build our products and other equipment used in the manufacturing process to be relatively flat compared to net cash provided by used in financing activities our cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in  and million in cash provided during is primarily attributable to an increase in our borrowings from our bank line of credit of million partially offset by payments made on our long term debt of million

we anticipate that our free cash flow from operations  along with cash generated from liquidating our excess inventory in place at december   and cash generated from the sale of property and equipment formerly used in our domestic manufacturing facilities will allow for significant levels of debt reductions in we have historically had fairly low levels of capital expenditures required to operate our business 
we have structured our new credit facilities based on projections incorporating all of the factors above  and we believe we will have adequate resources to meet our obligations as they come due through december  recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin will be effective beginning q the company does not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no

in june  the fasb ratified emerging issues task force eitf issue  how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that 
table of contents is  gross versus net presentation 
eitf requires a company to disclose its accounting policy ie  gross or net presentation regarding the presentation of taxes within the scope of eitf if taxes are significant  a company should disclose the amount of such taxes for each period for which an income statement is presented 
the guidance is effective for periods beginning after december  the adoption of eitf will not result in a change to the company s accounting policy or have an effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including fluctuations in foreign currency rates and interest rates 
we may enter into various derivative transactions to manage certain of these exposures  however we did not have any derivative financial instruments as of december  at december   we had variable rate lines of credit with outstanding balances of million 
in addition  our million term loans also had variable interest rates 
as such  changes in us interest rates affect interest on debt and we are exposed to interest rate risk 
for the year ended december   an increase in the average interest rate of  ie from to  would have resulted in an approximately  decrease in net income before income taxes 
the fair value of such debt approximates the carrying amount on the consolidated balance sheet at december  a majority of our sales are denominated in us dollars  and during the fiscal year ended december  approximately of our sales were denominated in foreign currencies 
we ordinarily do not engage in hedging  rate swaps  or other derivates as a means to minimize our foreign currency risk and  instead  mitigate that exposure by limiting the portion of our sales that are denominated in other than us dollars 
assuming the same level of foreign currency denominated sales as in  a decline in the average exchange rates for all these currencies would have caused a million  or  decline in our sales
