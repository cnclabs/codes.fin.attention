item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion should be read in conjunction with pinnacle west s consolidated financial statements and arizona public service company s financial statements and the related notes that appear in item of this report 
overview pinnacle west owns all of the outstanding common stock of aps 
aps is a vertically integrated electric utility that provides retail and wholesale electric service to most of the state of arizona  with the major exceptions of about one half of the phoenix metropolitan area  the tucson metropolitan area and mohave county in northwestern arizona 
aps has historically accounted for a substantial part of our revenues and earnings  and is expected to continue to do so 
customer growth in aps service territory is about three times the national average and remains a fundamental driver of our revenues and earnings 
the acc regulates aps retail electric rates 
the key issue affecting pinnacle west s and aps financial outlook is the satisfactory resolution of aps retail rate proceedings pending before the acc 
as discussed in greater detail in note  these proceedings consist of a general retail rate case pursuant to which aps is requesting a  or million  increase in its annual retail electricity revenues  an application for a temporary rate increase of approximately  through a psa surcharge  to recover million in retail fuel and purchased power costs relating to palo verde s unplanned outages that were deferred by aps in under the psa and are subject to the acc s completion of an inquiry regarding the outages this matter is now being addressed in the general retail rate case  and the acc s prudency review of amounts collected through the may  interim psa adjustor see interim rate increase in note related to unplanned palo verde outages 
the related psa deferrals were approximately million in suncor  our real estate development subsidiary  has been and is expected to be an important source of earnings 
see discussion below in pinnacle west consolidated factors affecting our financial outlook subsidiaries 
our subsidiary  aps energy services  provides competitive commodity related energy services and energy related products and services to commercial and industrial retail customers in the western united states 
el dorado  our investment subsidiary  owns minority interests in several energy related investments and arizona community based ventures 
pinnacle west energy was a subsidiary that owned and operated unregulated generating plants 
pursuant to the acc s april  order in aps retail rate settlement  on july   pinnacle west energy transferred the pwec dedicated assets to aps 
pinnacle west energy sold its interest in silverhawk to npc on january  see note for a discussion of discontinued operations 
as a result  pinnacle west energy no longer owned any generating plants and was dissolved as of august  
table of contents we continue to focus on solid operational performance in our electricity generation and delivery activities 
in the delivery area  we focus on superior reliability and customer satisfaction 
we plan to expand long term resources and our transmission and distribution systems to meet the electricity needs of our growing retail customers and sustain reliability 
see pinnacle west consolidated factors affecting our financial outlook below for a discussion of several factors that could affect our future financial results 
pinnacle west consolidated earnings contribution by business segment pinnacle west s two principal business segments are our regulated electricity segment  which consists of traditional regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses primarily electric service to native load customers and related activities and includes electricity generation  transmission and distribution  and our real estate segment  which consists of suncor s real estate development and investment activities 
our reportable business segments reflect a change from the previously reported information 
as of december   our marketing and trading activities are no longer considered a segment requiring separate reporting or disclosure 
the marketing and trading activities consist of our competitive energy business  including wholesale marketing and trading and retail commodity related energy services 
these activities have decreased as a result of fewer market opportunities and the company s intention to deemphasize that part of our business 
these activities are now reported as part of the other category in the table below 
the corresponding information for earlier periods has been reclassified 
the following table summarizes income from continuing operations by segment for december   and and reconciles to net income in total dollars in millions regulated electricity a real estate other b income from continuing operations discontinued operations net of tax real estate c sale of silverhawk d sale of nac net income a includes an million after tax regulatory disallowance of plant costs in in accordance with aps general retail rate case settlement 
b primarily marketing and trading activity 
c primarily relates to sales of commercial properties 
d see note 
table of contents pinnacle west consolidated results of operations general throughout the following explanations of our results of operations  we refer to gross margin 
with respect to our regulated electricity segment and our marketing and trading contributions  gross margin refers to operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs 
gross margin is a non gaap financial measure  as defined in accordance with sec rules 
exhibit reconciles this non gaap financial measure to operating income  which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
we view gross margin as an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations 
this measure is a key component of our internal financial reporting and is used by our management in analyzing our business segments 
we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses 
deferred fuel and purchased power costs our subsidiary  aps  settled its general retail rate case effective april  as part of the settlement  the acc approved the psa  which permits aps to defer for recovery or refund fluctuations in retail fuel and purchased power costs  subject to specified parameters 
in accordance with the psa  aps defers for future rate recovery of the difference between actual retail fuel and purchased power costs and the amount of such costs currently included in base rates 
aps recovery of psa deferrals from its customers is subject to the acc s approval of annual psa adjustments and periodic surcharge applications 
see power supply adjustor in note since the inception of the psa  aps has incurred substantially higher fuel and purchased power costs than those authorized for recovery through aps current base rates primarily due to the use of higher cost resources and has deferred those cost differences in accordance with the psa 
the balance of aps psa deferrals at december  was approximately million 
the recovery of psa deferrals through acc approved adjustors and surcharges recorded as revenue is offset dollar for dollar by the amortization of those deferred expenses recorded as fuel and purchased power 
aps operated palo verde unit at reduced power levels from december  until march  due to vibration levels in one of the unit s shutdown cooling lines 
during an outage at unit from march  to july   aps performed the necessary work and modifications to remedy the situation 
aps estimates that incremental replacement power costs resulting from these and other unplanned palo verde outages and reduced power levels were approximately million during the related impact on the psa deferrals was an increase of approximately million 
these palo verde replacement power costs were partially offset by million of lower than expected replacement power costs related to aps other generating units during  which decreased psa deferrals by million 
the psa deferral balance at december  includes a million related to replacement power costs associated with unplanned palo verde outages and b million related to replacement power costs associated with unplanned outages or reduced power operations at palo verde 
the psa deferrals associated with these unplanned palo verde outages 
table of contents and reduced power operations are the subject of acc prudence reviews 
the acc staff has recommended disallowance of million of the costs 
the recommendation will be considered as part of aps general rate case currently before the acc 
see psa deferrals related to unplanned palo verde outages in note the acc staff recommendation does not change management s belief that the expenses in question were prudently incurred and  therefore  are recoverable 
see note compared with our consolidated net income for was million compared with million for the comparable prior year period 
the prior year included a net loss from discontinued operations of million  which was related to the sale and operations of silverhawk  partially offset by income from sales of real estate commercial properties at suncor 
income from continuing operations increased million in the period to period comparison  reflecting the following changes in earnings by segment regulated electricity segment income from continuing operations increased approximately million primarily due to an million after tax regulatory disallowance of plant costs recorded in income also increased due to higher retail sales volumes due to customer growth  income tax credits related to prior years resolved in  and increased other income due to higher interest income on higher investment balances 
these positive factors were partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expense related to generation and customer service  and higher depreciation and amortization primarily due to increased plant asset balances  partially offset by lower depreciation rates 
in addition  higher fuel and purchased power costs of million after tax were partially offset by the deferral of million after tax of costs in accordance with the psa 
see discussion deferred fuel and purchased power costs above 
real estate segment income from continuing operations increased approximately million primarily due to increased margins on residential sales and the sale of certain joint venture assets  partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses

off balance sheet arrangements in  aps entered into agreements with three separate vie lessors in order to sell and lease back interests in palo verde unit the leases are accounted for as operating leases in accordance with gaap 
we are not the primary beneficiary of the palo verde vies and  accordingly  do not consolidate them 

table of contents aps is exposed to losses under the palo verde sale leaseback agreements upon the occurrence of certain events that aps does not consider to be reasonably likely to occur 
under certain circumstances for example  the nrc issuing specified violation orders with respect to palo verde or the occurrence of specified nuclear events  aps would be required to assume the debt associated with the transactions  make specified payments to the equity participants  and take title to the leased unit interests  which  if appropriate  may be required to be written down in value

pinnacle west and aps comply with these covenants and each anticipates it will continue to meet these and other significant covenant requirements 
for both pinnacle west and aps  these covenants require that the ratio of consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization not exceed 
at december   the ratio was approximately for pinnacle west and for aps 
the provisions regarding interest coverage require a minimum cash coverage of two times the interest requirements for aps 
the interest coverage was approximately times under aps bank financing agreements as of december  failure to comply with such covenant levels would result in an event of default which  generally speaking  would require the immediate repayment of the debt subject to the covenants and could cross default other debt 
see further discussion of cross default provisions below

critical accounting policies in preparing the financial statements in accordance with gaap  management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex  and actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider the following accounting policies to be our most critical because of the uncertainties  judgments and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved 
regulatory accounting regulatory accounting allows for the actions of regulators  such as the acc and the ferc  to be reflected in our financial statements 
their actions may cause us to capitalize costs that would otherwise be included as an expense in the current period by unregulated companies 
if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable  the assets would be written off as a charge in current period earnings 
a major component of our regulatory assets is the retail fuel and power costs deferred under the psa 
aps defers for future rate recovery of the difference between actual retail fuel and power costs and the amount of such costs currently included in base rates 
we had million  including million related to the psa  of regulatory assets on the consolidated balance sheets at december  included in the million is approximately million related to the unplanned palo verde outages and million related to the unplanned outages  which currently are the subject of inquiry by the acc 
at december   aps recorded a regulatory asset of million in accordance with sfas no 
for pension and other postretirement benefits 
this regulatory asset represents the future recovery of these costs through retail rates as these amounts are charged to earnings 
if these costs are disallowed by the acc this regulatory asset would be charged to oci 
in addition  we had million of regulatory liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at december   which primarily are related to removal costs 
see notes  and for more information about regulatory assets  aps general rate case and the psa 

table of contents pensions and other postretirement benefit accounting changes in our actuarial assumptions used in calculating our pension and other postretirement benefit liability and expense can have a significant impact on our earnings and financial position 
the most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our liability and net periodic cost  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used to estimate earnings on invested funds over the long term  and the assumed healthcare cost trend rates 
we review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary 
the following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions would have had on the december  reported pension liability on the consolidated balance sheets and our reported pension expense  after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants  on pinnacle west s consolidated statements of income dollars in millions increase decrease impact on impact on pension pension actuarial assumption a liability expense discount rate increase decrease expected long term rate of return on plan assets increase decrease a each fluctuation assumes that the other assumptions of the calculation are held constant while the rates are changed by one percentage point

see note for further details about our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
derivative accounting derivative accounting requires evaluation of rules that are complex and subject to varying interpretations 
our evaluation of these rules  as they apply to our contracts  determines whether we use accrual accounting for contracts designated as normal or fair value mark to market accounting 
mark to market accounting requires that changes in the fair value are recognized periodically in income unless certain hedge criteria are met 
for fair value hedges  the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item associated with the hedged risk are recognized in earnings 
for cash flow hedges  the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in common stock equity as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
the fair value of our derivative contracts is not always readily determinable 
in some cases  we use models and other valuation techniques to determine fair value 
the use of these models and valuation techniques sometimes requires subjective and complex judgment 
actual results could differ from the results estimated through application of these methods 
our marketing and trading portfolio consists of structured activities hedged with a portfolio of forward purchases that protects the economic value of the sales transactions 
see market risks commodity price risk below for quantitative analysis

table of contents other accounting matters in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
this guidance requires us to recognize the tax benefits of an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authority 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold must be recognized in the financial statements at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating this new guidance and believe it will not have a material impact on retained earnings

pinnacle west consolidated factors affecting our financial outlook factors affecting operating revenues  fuel and purchased power costs general electric operating revenues are derived from sales of electricity in regulated retail markets in arizona and from competitive retail and wholesale power markets in the western united states 
for the years through  retail electric revenues comprised approximately of our total electric operating revenues 
our electric operating revenues are affected by electricity sales volumes related to customer mix  customer growth  average usage per customer  electricity rates and tariffs  variations in weather from period to period  and amortization of psa deferrals 
competitive retail sales of energy and energy related products and services are made by aps energy services in certain western states that have opened to competition 
off system sales of excess generation output  purchased power and natural gas are included in regulated electricity segment revenues and related fuel and purchased power because the gross margin is credited to aps retail customers through the psa see note 
these revenue transactions are affected by the availability of excess generation or other energy resources and wholesale market conditions  including demand and prices 
competitive wholesale transactions are made by the marketing and trading group through structured trading opportunities involving matched sales and purchases of commodities 
retail rate proceedings the key issue affecting pinnacle west s and aps financial outlook is the satisfactory resolution of aps retail rate proceedings pending before the acc  which are discussed in greater detail in note the most significant pending retail rate proceedings are aps general rate case request and an application for a psa surcharge  or temporary rate increase  related to incremental replacement power costs incurred by aps in in connection with 
table of contents unplanned outages at palo verde  which is subject to the acc s review of the unplanned outages 
these matters have been consolidated procedurally and a decision on them by the acc is expected in the second quarter of in addition  the acc staff is conducting a review of the prudence of approximately million in psa deferrals related to unplanned outages at palo verde 
fuel and purchased power costs fuel and purchased power costs included on our income statements are impacted by our electricity sales volumes  existing contracts for purchased power and generation fuel  our power plant performance  transmission availability or constraints  prevailing market prices  new generating plants being placed in service in our market areas  our hedging program for managing such costs and  since april   psa deferrals and amortization thereof 
see power supply adjustor in note for information regarding the psa  including psa deferrals related to palo verde unplanned outages and reduced power operations that are the subject of acc prudence reviews 
see natural gas supply in note for more information on fuel costs 
aps recovery of psa deferrals from its ratepayers is subject to the acc s approval of annual psa adjustments and periodic surcharge applications 
customer and sales growth the customer and sales growth referred to in this paragraph applies to native load customers and sales to them 
customer growth in aps service territory was during such growth averaged a year for the three years from through  and we currently expect customer growth to average about per year from to for the three years through  aps actual retail electricity sales in kilowatt hours grew at an average rate of  adjusted to exclude effects of weather variations  such retail sales growth averaged a year 
we currently estimate that total retail electricity sales in kilowatt hours will grow on average  from through  before the effects of weather variations 
we currently expect our retail sales growth in to be below average because of potential effects on customer usage from the retail rate increases proposed by aps see note 
actual sales growth  excluding weather related variations  may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors  such as economic conditions  customer growth  usage patterns and responses to retail price changes 
our experience indicates that a reasonable range of variation in our kilowatt hour sales projection attributable to such economic factors can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to million 
weather in forecasting retail sales growth  we assume normal weather patterns based on historical data 
historical extreme weather variations have resulted in annual variations in net income in excess of million 
however  our experience indicates that the more typical variations from normal weather can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to million 
wholesale market conditions the marketing and trading group focuses primarily on managing aps risks relating to fuel and purchased power costs in connection with its costs of serving native load customer demand 
the marketing and trading group  subject to specified parameters  markets  hedges and trades in electricity  fuels and emission allowances and credits 
other factors affecting financial results operations and maintenance expenses operations and maintenance expenses are impacted by growth  power plant additions and operations  inflation  outages  higher trending pension and other postretirement benefit costs and other factors 

table of contents depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses are impacted by net additions to utility plant and other property  which include generation construction  changes in depreciation and amortization rates  and changes in regulatory asset amortization 
property taxes taxes other than income taxes consist primarily of property taxes  which are affected by the value of property in service and under construction  assessed valuation ratios  and tax rates 
the average property tax rate for aps  which currently owns the majority of our property  was of assessed value for and for and we expect property taxes to increase as new power plants including the sundance plant acquired in and additions to our transmission and distribution facilities are included in the property tax base 
interest expense interest expense is affected by the amount of debt outstanding and the interest rates on that debt 
the primary factors affecting borrowing levels are expected to be our capital expenditures  long term debt maturities  and internally generated cash flow 
capitalized interest offsets a portion of interest expense while capital projects are under construction 
we stop accruing capitalized interest on a project when it is placed in commercial operation 
retail competition although some very limited retail competition existed in arizona in and  there are currently no active retail competitors providing unbundled energy or other utility services to aps customers 
we cannot predict when  and the extent to which  additional competitors will re enter aps service territory 
subsidiaries suncor s net income was million in  million in  and million in see note for further discussion 
we currently expect suncor s net income in will be between million and million

arizona public service company results of operations general throughout the following explanations of our results of operations  we refer to gross margin 
gross margin refers to electric operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs 
gross margin is a non gaap financial measure  as defined in accordance with sec rules 
exhibit reconciles this non gaap financial measure to operating income  which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
we view gross margin as an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations 
this measure is a key component of our internal financial reporting and is used by our management in analyzing our business 
we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses 
deferred fuel and purchased power costs the settlement of our general retail rate case became effective april  as part of the settlement  the acc approved the psa  which permits aps to defer for recovery or refund fluctuations in retail fuel and purchased power costs  subject to specified parameters 
in accordance with the psa  aps defers for future rate recovery of the difference between actual retail fuel and purchased power costs and the amount of such costs currently included in base rates 
aps recovery of psa deferrals from its customers is subject to the acc s approval of annual psa adjustments and periodic surcharge applications 
see power supply adjustor in note since the inception of the psa  aps has incurred substantially higher fuel and purchased power costs than those authorized for recovery through aps current base rates primarily due to the use of higher cost resources and has deferred those cost differences in accordance with the psa 
the balance of aps psa deferrals at december  was approximately million 
the recovery of psa deferrals through acc approved adjustors and surcharges recorded as revenue is offset dollar for dollar by the amortization of those deferred expenses recorded as fuel and purchased power 
aps operated palo verde unit at reduced power levels from december  until march  due to vibration levels in one of the unit s shutdown cooling lines 
during an outage at unit from march  to july   aps performed the necessary work and modifications to remedy the situation 
aps estimates that incremental replacement power costs resulting from these and other unplanned palo verde outages and reduced power levels were approximately million during the related impact on the psa deferrals was an increase of 
table of contents approximately million 
these palo verde replacement power costs were partially offset by million of lower than expected replacement power costs related to aps other generating units during  which decreased psa deferrals by million 
the psa deferral balance at december  includes a million related to replacement power costs associated with unplanned palo verde outages and b million related to replacement power costs associated with unplanned outages or reduced power operations at palo verde 
the psa deferrals associated with these unplanned palo verde outages and reduced power operations are the subject of acc prudence reviews 
the acc staff has recommended disallowance of million of the costs 
the recommendation will be considered as part of aps general rate case currently before the acc 
see psa deferrals related to unplanned palo verde outages in note the acc staff recommendation does not change management s belief that the expenses in question were prudently incurred and  therefore  are recoverable 
see note compared with aps net income for the was million compared with million for the comparable prior year period 
the million increase was primarily due to an million after tax regulatory disallowance of plant costs recorded in income also increased due to higher retail sales volumes due to customer growth  higher marketing and trading gross margin primarily due to higher mark to market gains  income tax credits related to prior years resolved in  and increased other income due to higher interest income on higher investment balances 
these positive factors were partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expense related to generation and customer service  higher depreciation and amortization primarily due to increased plant asset balances  partially offset by lower depreciation rates  and higher interest expense 
in addition  higher fuel and purchased power costs of million after tax were partially offset by the deferral of million after tax of costs in accordance with the psa
