item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general frontier operates refineries in cheyenne  wyoming and el dorado  kansas as previously discussed in part i  item of this form k 
we focus our marketing efforts in the rocky mountain and plains states regions of the united states 
we purchase crude oil to be refined and market refined petroleum products including various grades of gasoline  diesel  jet fuel  asphalt and other by products 
results of operations to assist in understanding our operating results  please refer to the operating data at the end of this analysis which provides key operating information for our refineries 
refinery operating data is also included in our quarterly reports on form q and on our web site address http www 
frontieroil 
com 
we make our web site content available for informational purposes only 
it should not be relied upon for investment purposes  nor is it incorporated by reference in this form k 
overview our refineries have a total annual average crude oil capacity of  bpd 
the four significant indicators of our profitability which are reflected and defined in the operating data at the end of this analysis  are the gasoline crack spread  the diesel crack spread  the light heavy crude oil differential and the wti wts crude oil differential 
other significant factors that influence our financial results are refinery utilization  crude oil price trends  asphalt and by product margins and refinery operating expenses including natural gas and maintenance 
under our first in  first out fifo inventory accounting method  crude oil price trends can cause significant fluctuations in the inventory valuation of our crude oil  unfinished products and finished products  thereby resulting in fifo inventory gains when crude oil prices increase and fifo inventory losses when crude oil prices decrease during the reporting period 
we typically do not use derivative instruments to offset price risk on our base level of operating inventories 
see price risk management activities under item a for a discussion of our utilization of futures trading 
the nymex crude oil price was volatile during  beginning the year at per barrel  reaching a high of per barrel in mid july  reducing to the annual low of per barrel in mid november and ending at per barrel 
crude oil market fundamentals and geopolitical considerations have caused crude oil prices to be volatile and generally higher than historic averages 
the increase in crude oil prices  along with additional production of heavy and or sour crude oil  increased our crude oil differentials during the year ended december   when compared to the same period in our gasoline and diesel crack spreads were the highest in our history  while gasoline and diesel crack spreads were the second highest in our history 
as discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements  during the fourth quarter of we changed our accounting method for the costs for planned major maintenance turnarounds from the accrual method to the deferral method 
turnarounds are the scheduled and required shutdowns of refinery processing units for significant overhaul and refurbishment 
under the deferral method  the costs of turnarounds are deferred when incurred and amortized on a straight line basis over the period of time estimated to lapse until the next turnaround occurs 
we adopted this new method of accounting for turnarounds in order to adhere to fsp no 
aug air accounting for planned maintenance activities  which prohibits the accrual method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities 
the company elected to early adopt the fsp during the fourth quarter of the comparative consolidated financial statements for and have been adjusted to reflect the period specific effects of applying the new accounting principle 
deferred charges related to these turnaround costs are included in our consolidated balance sheets in deferred charges and other assets 
the associated amortization expenses are included in refinery operating expenses  excluding depreciation in our consolidated statements of income 
as discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we effected stock splits on june  and june  all prior period share related numbers have been revised to reflect the effect of the stock splits 
compared with as adjusted overview of results we had net income for the year ended december   of million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in the same period in our operating income of million for the year ended december   reflected an increase of million from the million operating income for the comparable period in the average diesel crack spread was higher during per barrel than in per barrel 
the average gasoline crack spread was also higher during per barrel than in per barrel  and both the light heavy and wti wts crude oil differentials improved 
specific variances refined product revenues 
refined product revenues increased million  or  from billion to billion for the year ended december  compared to the same period in this increase was due to both an increase in average product sales prices higher per sales barrel and an increase in product sales volumes in  more bpd 
sales prices increased primarily as a result of increased crude oil prices and improvements in the gasoline and diesel crack spreads 
manufactured product yields 
manufactured product yields yields are the volumes of specific materials that are obtained through the distilling of crude oil and the operations of other refinery process units 
yields increased  bpd at the el dorado refinery while decreasing  bpd at the cheyenne refinery for the year ended december  compared to a cheyenne refinery turnaround in april caused yields to be lower during than during  and an el dorado refinery turnaround from march through april  caused yields to be lower in than other revenues 
other revenues increased million to a million gain for the year ended december   compared to a million gain for the same period in  the sources of which were million in net gains from derivative contracts in the year ended december  compared to net derivative gains of million for the same period in and million in gasoline sulfur credit sales in none in 
we utilized more derivative contracts during the year ended december  than in the comparable period in  primarily due to derivative contracts to hedge canadian in transit crude oil for our el dorado refinery 
see price risk management activities under item a and note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our utilization of commodity derivative contracts 
raw material  freight and other costs 
raw material  freight and other costs include crude oil and other raw materials used in the refining process  purchased products and blendstocks  freight costs for fob destination sales  as well as the impact of changes in inventory under the fifo inventory accounting method 
raw material  freight and other costs increased by million  or  during the year ended december   from billion in to billion in the increase in raw material  freight and other costs when compared to was due to higher average crude prices  higher crude oil charges on an overall combined basis  and fifo inventory losses in the year ended december  we benefited from slightly improved crude oil differentials during the year ended december  compared to the same period in the average wti crude oil priced at cushing  oklahoma conocophillips wti crude oil posting plus was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  crude oil charges were  bpd for the year ended december   compared to  bpd for the comparable period in for the year ended december   we realized an increase in raw material  freight and other costs as a result of net fifo inventory losses of approximately million after tax million pretax  comprised of a million loss at the el dorado refinery and a million gain at the cheyenne refinery due to decreasing crude oil and refined product prices during the latter part of for the year ended december   we realized a reduction in raw material  freight and other costs as a result of fifo inventory gains of approximately million after tax million pretax  comprised of million for the el dorado refinery and million for the cheyenne refinery because of increasing crude oil and refined product prices 
the cheyenne refinery raw material  freight and other costs of per sales barrel for the year ended december  increased from per sales barrel in the same period in due to higher crude oil prices and a lower fifo inventory gain  offset by fewer crude oil charges and the benefit of a slightly improved light heavy crude oil differential 
crude oil charges of  bpd for the year ended december  were lower than the  bpd in the comparable period in because of the previously mentioned turnaround in the heavy crude oil utilization rate at the cheyenne refinery expressed as a percentage of the total crude oil charge decreased to in the year ended december   from in as we increased our charges of lighter crude oil to take advantage of favorable pricing opportunities for light crude purchases 
the light heavy crude oil differential for the cheyenne refinery averaged per barrel in the year ended december  compared to per barrel in the same period in the el dorado refinery raw material  freight and other costs of per sales barrel for the year ended december  increased from per sales barrel in the same period in due to higher average crude oil prices and a fifo inventory loss in compared to fifo inventory gains in crude oil charges were  bpd for the year ended december   compared to  bpd for the comparable period in because of the previously mentioned turnaround in in  our el dorado refinery began charging canadian heavy crude oil and achieved a light heavy crude oil differential of per barrel 
for the year ended december   the heavy crude oil utilization rate at our el dorado refinery expressed as a percentage of the total crude oil charge was approximately 
the wti wts crude oil differential increased from an average of per barrel in the year ended december  to per barrel in the same period in refinery operating expenses 
refinery operating expenses  excluding depreciation  include both the variable costs energy and utilities and the fixed costs salaries  taxes  maintenance costs and other of operating the refineries 
refinery operating expenses  excluding depreciation  increased million  or  from million in the year ended december  to million in the comparable period of the cheyenne refinery operating expenses  excluding depreciation  were million in the year ended december   compared to million in the comparable period of the increased expenses included higher maintenance costs million  with million of the costs related to a plant wide steam outage in february  million for slop oil centrifuging   related to a september coker outage and  related to a butamer unit outage  increased environmental expenses million  including a million accrual related to a potential waste water pond clean up  higher salaries and benefits million  including million in increased stock based compensation costs and  additional bonus accruals  higher additive and chemical costs million  including increased wastewater treatment chemical use  cost of testing chemicals from a new vendor and increased usage of fresh fluid catalyst and higher turnaround amortization million 
the el dorado refinery operating expenses  excluding depreciation  were million in the year ended december   increasing from million for the year ended december  the primary areas of increased costs were in electricity million  chemicals and additives million  maintenance million  including million due to a fire on a distillate hydrotreater unit  million for tank repairs and million for a gofiner unit catalyst change out  salaries and benefits million  including  in increased stock based compensation costs  lease and rental equipment million  including higher cogeneration facility lease costs and rentals for a reverse osmosis trailer and filter  environmental  insurance  and non maintenance contractors 
electricity costs were higher during the year ended december   compared to the same period in  as we produced electricity from our cogeneration facility in and did not do so in chemicals and additive costs were higher during the year ended december   compared to the same period in  as the fluid catalytic cracking unit consumed more additives and chemicals running for the full year in  while it was down for turnaround work for approximately one month in we also purchased more nitrogen and oxygen during than in because the cogeneration facility provided us with some nitrogen and oxygen in we realized a million reduction in natural gas costs due to lower natural gas prices and lower consumption in because we did not purchase natural gas for the cogeneration facility 
selling and general expenses 
selling and general expenses  excluding depreciation  increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   primarily due to a million increase in salaries and benefits expense  which resulted from the adoption on january  of fas no 
r  the issuance of additional stock based compensation awards  the vesting of stock based compensation upon the retirement of an executive officer as of march  and higher bonus accruals 
see note under stock based compensation in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of our stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the comparable period in beverly hills litigation costs also increased by million in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   as the litigation costs were reduced by insurance recoveries and litigation costs increased in preparation for certain court proceedings which took place in the fourth quarter of and early depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in because of increased capital investment in our refineries  including the ultra low sulfur diesel projects 
interest expense and other financing costs 
interest expense and other financing costs of million for the year ended december  increased million  or  from million in the comparable period in the increase was due to million in accrued interest expense for income tax contingencies in  in and million in facility costs and financing expenses related to the utexam master crude oil purchase and sale contract entered into in march utexam arrangement see leases and other commitments in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements  offset by million of interest cost being capitalized in the year ended december   compared to only million of interest cost being capitalized in the year ended december  and revolving credit facility interest expense of  for the year ended december   decreasing by  from the  for the year ended december  average debt outstanding excluding amounts payable under the utexam arrangement decreased to million during the year ended december  from million for the same period in interest and investment income 
interest and investment income increased million  or  from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december   due to larger cash balances and higher interest rates on invested cash 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was million on pretax income of million or compared to million on pretax income of million or for the same period in the american jobs creation act of the act benefited both our and current income taxes payable by allowing us an accelerated depreciation deduction of of qualified capital costs incurred to achieve low sulfur diesel fuel requirements see environmental under note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the act also provides for a per gallon credit on compliant diesel fuel up to an amount equal to the remaining of these qualified capital costs for federal income tax purposes and for the year ended december  we realized a million federal income tax credit million excess tax benefit 
this credit greatly reduced our income taxes payable and reduced our overall effective income tax rate 
another provision of the act which benefited our and income taxes payable by an estimated million and million  respectively  and reduced our overall effective tax rate in both of those years was the section production activities deduction for manufacturers 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for detailed information on our deferred tax assets 
our effective income tax rate for the year ended december  will be higher than that realized in the year ended december   as we only have approximately million of ultra low sulfur diesel production credits available for utilization in compared with as adjusted overview of results we had net income for the year ended december   of million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in the same period in our operating income of million for the year ended december   reflected an increase of million from the million operating income for the comparable period in the average diesel crack spread was significantly higher during per barrel than in per barrel 
the average gasoline crack spread was also higher during per barrel than in per barrel  and both the light heavy and wti wts crude oil differentials improved 
specific variances refined product revenues 
refined product revenues increased billion  or  from billion to billion for the year ended december  compared to the same period in this increase was primarily due to a significant increase in average product sales prices higher per sales barrel  and higher product sales volumes in  more bpd 
sales prices increased primarily as a result of increased crude oil prices and improvements in the gasoline and diesel crack spreads 
manufactured product yields 
yields increased  bpd at the el dorado refinery and  bpd at the cheyenne refinery for the year ended december  compared to other revenues 
other revenues increased million to a million gain for the year ended december   compared to a million loss for the same period in  the source of which was million in net gains from derivative contracts accounted for using mark to market accounting in the year ended december   compared to net derivative losses of million for the same period in see price risk management activities under item a and note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our utilization of commodity derivative contracts 
raw material  freight and other costs 
raw material  freight and other costs increased by million during the year ended december   from billion in to billion in the increase in raw material  freight and other costs was due to higher average crude prices and higher crude oil charges  reduced by higher fifo inventory gains from rising prices in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  we also benefited from improved crude oil differentials during the year ended december  when compared to the same period in for the year ended december   we realized a reduction in raw material  freight and other costs as a result of fifo inventory gains of approximately million after tax million pretax  comprised of million at the el dorado refinery and million at the cheyenne refinery due to increasing crude oil and refined product prices 
for the year ended december   we realized a reduction in raw material  freight and other costs as a result of fifo inventory gains of approximately million after tax million pretax  comprised of million for the el dorado refinery and million for the cheyenne refinery because of increasing crude oil and refined product prices 
the cheyenne refinery raw material  freight and other costs of per sales barrel for the year ended december  increased from per sales barrel in the same period in due to higher crude oil prices partially offset by higher fifo inventory gains and an improved light heavy crude oil differential 
the heavy crude oil utilization rate at the cheyenne refinery expressed as a percentage of the total crude oil charge decreased to in the year ended december  from in as we increased our charges of lighter crude oil to take advantage of market opportunities 
the light heavy crude oil differential for the cheyenne refinery averaged per barrel in the year ended december  compared to per barrel in the same period in the el dorado refinery raw material  freight and other costs of per sales barrel for the year ended december  increased from per sales barrel in the same period in due to higher average crude oil prices partially offset by higher fifo inventory gains and an improved wti wts crude oil differential 
the wti wts crude oil differential increased from an average of per barrel in the year ended december  to per barrel in the same period in refinery operating expenses 
refinery operating expenses  excluding depreciation  include both the variable costs energy and utilities and the fixed costs salaries  taxes  maintenance costs and other of operating the refineries 
refinery operating expenses  excluding depreciation  were million in the year ended december  compared to million in the comparable period of the cheyenne refinery operating expenses  excluding depreciation  were million in the year ended december   compared to million in the comparable period of the increased expenses included higher electricity costs million  increased environmental expenses million  higher salaries and benefits  and higher natural gas costs 
the higher natural gas costs resulted primarily from an average price increase of per mmbtu  materially offset by our using approximately less natural gas during the year ended december  when compared to the same period in the year ended december  included a  reduction of operating expenses related to a processing agreement which concluded during the el dorado refinery operating expenses  excluding depreciation  were million in the year ended december   increasing from million for the year ended december  the increased expenses included higher salaries and benefits million  natural gas million  electricity million  maintenance million and additives and chemicals million 
the higher natural gas costs resulted primarily from an average price increase of per mmbtu  partially offset by our using approximately less natural gas during the year ended december   when compared to the same period in amortization of turnaround costs was lower by million for the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  selling and general expenses 
selling and general expenses  excluding depreciation  increased  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  due to higher salaries and benefits million  primarily due to bonuses partly offset by lower costs related to the beverly hills litigation during the year ended december   when compared to  as the litigation costs were reduced by insurance recoveries 
merger termination and legal costs 
merger termination and legal costs include legal costs associated with the termination of the holly merger and the now concluded lawsuit 
these costs were  for the year ended december   compared to million in depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in because of increased capital investment in our refineries  the el dorado refinery contingent earn out payment and the write off of assets not fully depreciated which were retired and replaced during interest expense and other financing costs 
interest expense and other financing costs of million for the year ended december  decreased million  or  from million in the comparable period in this decrease was primarily due to the refinancing in late of our senior notes with million of senior notes 
the interest expense and other financing costs for year ended december   also included million in redemption related costs 
average debt outstanding decreased to million during the year ended december  from million for the same period in capitalized interest  which reduced interest expense and other financing costs  was million for the year ended december   compared to  in the comparable period of primarily due to the ultra low sulfur diesel capital projects which commenced in interest and investment income 
interest and investment income increased million  or  from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december   due to larger cash balances and higher interest rates on invested cash 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was million on pretax income of million or 
the provision reflects an estimated benefit from the section production activities deduction for manufacturers million  offset by the impact of permanent book tax differences 
the income tax provision for the year ended december  was million on pretax income of million or reflecting the net benefit of releasing our deferred tax valuation allowance 
our current income taxes payable for also benefited from the accelerated depreciation deduction of of qualified capital costs incurred to achieve low sulfur diesel fuel requirements 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million during the year ended december  improved results of operations increased cash flow significantly during  but were more than offset by uses of cash for working capital changes 
working capital changes used a total of million of cash in the year ended december  while providing million of cash in the comparable period in the uses of cash for working capital during the year ended december  included an increase in inventories of million  an increase in other current assets of million and an increase in trade  note and other receivables of million 
the increase in inventories was primarily due to an increased average price per barrel and increased crude oil in transit inventories for the el dorado refinery since we began importing crude oil from canada 
the most significant working capital item providing cash during the year ended december  was an increase in accounts payable of million 
this was due to increases in crude payables of million which resulted from increased crude oil inventory volumes  offset by net decreases in trade and other payables of million 
we made estimated federal and state income tax payments of million and million  respectively  during the year ended december  we received federal income tax refunds of million during  which represented refunds from amended returns filed in prior years 
as of december   we have accrued estimated federal income taxes payable of million and estimated state income taxes payable of million 
we also have estimated prepaid state income taxes of million  which will be applied to the related states income tax liabilities 
at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  working capital of million and million available for borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
our operating cash flows are affected by crude oil and refined product prices and other risks as discussed in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
cash flows used in investing activities

the million of capital expenditures for our cheyenne refinery included approximately million of capital for the ultra low sulfur diesel project and million for the coker expansion project  as well as environmental  operational  safety  administrative and payout projects 
we funded our capital expenditures with cash generated from our operations 
under the provisions of the purchase agreement with shell for our el dorado refinery  we have made  or may be required to make  contingent earn out payments for each of the years through equal to one half of the excess over million per year of the el dorado refinery s annual revenues less its raw material  freight and other costs and refinery operating expenses  excluding depreciation 
the total amount of these contingent earn out payments is capped at million  with an annual cap of million 
payments of million each were required based on both and results  and were accrued as of december  and and paid in january and  respectively 
such contingent earn out payments are recorded as additional acquisition costs 
based on the results of operations for the year ended december   a payment of million was required  and was accrued as of december   and paid in january including the payment we made in early  we have paid a total of million for contingent earn out payments 
during the year ended december   we received net proceeds of million from the sales of assets  including the sale of fgi  llc  our asphalt terminal and storage facility located in grand island  nebraska  during the fourth quarter of cash flows used in financing activities 
during the year ended december   we issued  shares of common stock due to stock option exercises by employees and members of our board of directors  for which we received million in cash 
during the year ended december   we received  shares million of our common stock  now held as treasury stock  from employees and members of our board of directors who surrendered stock to pay withholding taxes related to stock based compensation 
in november  our board of directors approved a new million share repurchase program  which replaced all existing repurchase authorizations and may be utilized for share repurchases in the near term no shares had been repurchased under this new program as of december  
during the year ended december   under previous share repurchase authorizations  we purchased  shares million in open market transactions as well as paid million for stock repurchases which did not settle until early and were accrued as of december  as of december   we had million of long term debt  due  and no borrowings under our million revolving credit facility 
we had million of outstanding letters of credit under our revolving credit facility 
we were in compliance with the financial covenants of our revolving credit facility as of december  we had shareholders equity of million as of december  our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share of common stock and a special cash dividend of per share of common stock in december  which was paid in january in march  our board of directors declared quarterly cash dividends of per share of common stock  which was paid in april our board of directors declared quarterly cash dividends of per share of common stock in june  september and december   which were paid in july  october  and january  respectively 
the total cash required for the dividend declared in december was approximately million and was accrued as a dividend payable at year end 
accrued dividends on the consolidated balance sheets include dividends accrued to date on restricted stock  which are not paid until the restricted stock vests 
future capital expenditures 
four major capital projects were started in which we expect to complete in and these projects include a million crude unit and vacuum expansion with an associated metallurgy upgrade at our el dorado refinery and  at our cheyenne refinery  a million coker expansion and revamp  an million new amine unit and an million crude fractionation project 
the above amounts include estimated capitalized interest 
at december   outstanding purchase commitments for the crude unit and vacuum tower expansion project at our el dorado refinery were million 
at our cheyenne refinery  the coker expansion project s outstanding commitments at december  were million 
our board of directors has approved four additional major capital improvement projects for our el dorado refinery which are anticipated to be completed between and these projects include an million gasoil hydrotreater revamp  an million catalytic cracker expansion  a million coke drum replacement  and a million catalytic cracker regenerator emission control project 
the above amounts include estimated capitalized interest 
we may experience cost overruns and or schedule delays on any of these projects because of strong industry demand for material  labor and engineering resources 
capital expenditures aggregating approximately million are currently planned for  and include million at our el dorado refinery  million at our cheyenne refinery  million for a buyout of a leased aircraft and  of capital expenditures for our denver and houston offices  and for our share of crude oil pipeline projects 
these capital expenditures for also include million for the acquisition million of  and capital expenditure projects for  ethanol management company  a  bpd products terminal and blending facility located near denver  colorado see note  subsequent event acquisition of ethanol management company in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the million of planned capital expenditures for our el dorado refinery includes approximately million on the crude unit and vacuum tower expansion  million for coke drum replacement and million for a gasoil hydrotreater revamp  as mentioned above  as well as environmental  operational  safety  administrative and payout projects 
the million of planned capital expenditures for our cheyenne refinery includes approximately million on the coker expansion  million on the new amine plant and million on the crude fractionation project  as mentioned above  as well as environmental  operational  safety  administrative and payout projects 
our capital expenditures will be funded with cash generated by our operations and the utilization of a portion of our existing cash balance  if necessary 
the crude unit and vacuum tower expansion at the el dorado refinery will allow for higher crude charge rates including a significantly greater percentage of heavy crude oil and higher gasoline and distillate yields 
this project also includes a significant metallurgical upgrade to the unit which will allow for running high napthenic acid crude oils  a characteristic typical of crude types found in western canada  west africa and the north sea 
this project will likely be brought online in the spring of during the next planned turnaround for the crude vacuum unit complex 
the coker expansion at the cheyenne refinery  which is anticipated to be completed in  will significantly decrease the amount of asphalt produced and increase the amount of higher margin products 
the new amine unit at the cheyenne refinery is intended to result in improved alkylation unit reliability and provide a partial backup unit if the main amine unit is not operating 
the project is expected to be completed and start up occurring in the latter half of the crude fractionation project at the cheyenne refinery will allow us to improve the recovery of diesel from the crude charged to the refinery and is expected to be completed in the gasoil hydrotreater revamp at the el dorado refinery is the key project to achieve gasoline sulfur compliance for our el dorado refinery see environmental in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the project will also result in significant yield improvement for the catalytic cracking unit and is anticipated to be completed in the spring of the el dorado refinery catalytic cracker expansion project includes a revamp component and new technology which will increase charge rate and improve product yields and is also anticipated to be completed in the spring of the coke drum replacement project for our el dorado refinery includes safety and reliability components as well as overall throughput support for the refinery and is expected to be completed by mid the el dorado refinery catalytic cracker regenerator emission control project  with a spring estimated completion date  will add a scrubber to improve the environmental performance of the unit  specifically as it relates to flue gas emissions 
this project is necessary to support the catalytic cracking expansion project and to meet a portion of the expected requirements of the epa petroleum refining initiative see environmental in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
contractual cash obligations the table on the following page lists the contractual cash obligations we have by period 
these items include our long term debt based on their maturity dates  our operating lease commitments  purchase obligations and other long term liabilities 
our operating leases include building  equipment  aircraft and vehicle leases  which expire from through  as well as an operating sublease for the use of the cogeneration facility at our el dorado refinery 
the non cancelable sublease  entered into in connection with the acquisition of our el dorado refinery in  expires in with an option that allows us to renew the sublease for an additional eight years 
this lease has both a fixed and a variable component 
purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
the amounts shown in the table on the following page for transportation  terminalling and storage contractual obligations include our anticipated commitments based on our agreements for shipping crude oil on the express pipeline  the spearhead pipeline and a new pipeline from guernsey  wyoming to our cheyenne refinery which is expected to first transport crude oil in mid for more information on the agreements discussed above  see lease and other commitments in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
contractual cash obligations payments due by period total within year within years within years after years in thousands long term debt interest on long term debt operating leases purchase obligations baytex crude supply other crude supply  feedstocks and natural gas transportation  terminalling and storage refinery capital projects other goods and services total purchase obligations other long term liabilities pension and post retirement healthcare and other benefit plans funding requirements total contractual cash baytex crude supply and other crude supply  feedstocks and natural gas future obligations were calculated using current market prices and or prices established in applicable contracts 
of these obligations  million relate to january and february feedstock and natural gas requirements of the refineries 
the million of refinery capital projects primarily consists of million for the crude unit and vacuum tower expansion project at our el dorado refinery and million for the coker expansion project at our cheyenne refinery 
these amounts for refinery capital projects reflected here relate to current commitments not accrued as of december   not the total estimated costs of the projects 
no pension funding will be required in for our cash balance pension plan 
funding requirements for remaining years will be based on actuarial estimates and actual experience 
our retiree health care plan is unfunded 
future payments for retiree health care benefits are estimated for the next ten years in note employee benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we have an interest in one unconsolidated entity see note nature of operations in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
other than facility and equipment leasing agreements  we do not participate in any transactions  agreements or other contractual arrangements which would result in any off balance sheet liabilities or other arrangements to us 
environmental we will be making significant future capital expenditures to comply with various environmental regulations 
see environmental in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following summary provides information about our critical accounting policies  including identification of those involving critical accounting estimates  and should be read in conjunction with note in the notes to consolidated financial statements  which summarizes our significant accounting policies 
turnarounds 
normal maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred 
planned major maintenance turnarounds is the scheduled and required shutdowns of refinery processing units for significant overhaul and refurbishment 
turnaround costs include contract services  materials and rental equipment 
during the fourth quarter of  we adopted a change in accounting method for the costs of turnarounds from the accrual method to the deferral method 
under the deferral method  the costs of turnarounds are deferred when incurred and amortized on a straight line basis over the period of time estimated to lapse until the next turnaround occurs 
these deferred charges are included in our consolidated balance sheets in deferred charges and other assets along with the cost of catalyst that is replaced at periodic intervals when the quality of the catalyst has deteriorated beyond its prescribed function 
the catalyst costs are deferred when incurred and amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the specific catalyst 
the amortization expenses are included in refinery operating expenses  excluding depreciation in our consolidated statements of income 
see note change in accounting principle turnarounds in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
inventories 
inventories of crude oil  unfinished products and all finished products are recorded at the lower of cost on a fifo basis or market 
crude oil includes both domestic and foreign crude oil volumes at its cost and associated freight and other cost 
unfinished products work in process include any crude oil that has entered into the refining process  and other feedstocks that are not finished as far as refining operations are concerned 
these include unfinished gasoline and diesel  blendstocks and other feedstocks 
finished product inventory includes saleable gasoline  diesel  jet fuel  chemicals  asphalt and other finished products 
unfinished and finished products inventory values have components of raw material  the associated raw material freight and other costs  and direct refinery operating expense allocated when refining begins relative to their proportionate market values 
the fifo method of accounting for inventories sometimes results in our recognizing substantial gains in periods of rising prices or losses in periods of falling prices from our inventories of crude oil and products 
while we believe that this accounting method accurately reflects the results of our operations  many other refining companies instead utilize the last in  first out lifo method of accounting for inventories 
thus  a comparison of our results to other refineries must take into account the impact of the inventory accounting differences

we account for asset retirement obligations as required under the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standard fas no 
 accounting for retirement asset obligations 
fas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which the liability is incurred  with the associated asset retirement costs being capitalized as a part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
fas no 
also includes disclosure requirements that provide a description of asset retirement obligations and reconciliation of changes in the components of those obligations 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin 
fin clarified that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fas no 
refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the reporting entity 
since the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional  fin provides that a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset obligation should be recognized if that fair value can be reasonably estimated  even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation under fas no 
we adopted fin as of december   in doing so  we recorded a net asset retirement obligation of million  recognized million in as the pretax cumulative effect of an accounting change million after tax and recorded a million increase in property  plant and equipment 
at december   our asset retirement obligation was million 
asset retirement obligations are affected by regulatory changes and refinery operations as well as changes in pricing of services 
in order to determine fair value  management must make certain estimates and assumptions  including  among other things  projected cash flows  a credit adjusted risk free interest rate  and an assessment of market conditions that could significantly impact the estimated fair value of the asset retirement obligation 
these estimates and assumptions are subjective and are currently based on historical costs with adjustments for estimated future changes in the associated costs 
therefore  we expect the dollar amount of these obligations to change as more information is obtained 
a change in pricing of services would cause an approximate  change to the asset retirement obligation 
we believe that we have adequately accrued for our asset retirement obligations at this time and that changes in estimates in future periods will not have a significant effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
see significant accounting policies in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on asset retirement obligations 
environmental expenditures 
environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized based upon their future economic benefit 
costs that improve a property s pre existing condition  and costs that prevent future environmental contamination  are capitalized 
remediation costs related to environmental damage resulting from operating activities subsequent to acquisition are expensed 
liabilities for these expenditures are recorded when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
such estimates are subject to change due to many factors  including the identification of new sites requiring remediation  changes in environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation  additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts  and potential improvements in remediation technologies 
pension and other post retirement benefit obligations 
we have significant pension and post retirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including discount rates  expected returns on plan assets and health care inflation rates 
changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of our control 
these assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on these plans and the current assumptions used

market risks see the item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk and notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements under price risk management activities for a discussion of our various price risk management activities 
when we make the decision to manage our price exposure  our objective is generally to avoid losses from negative price changes  realizing we will not obtain the benefit of positive price changes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk impact of changing prices 
our revenues and cash flows  as well as estimates of future cash flows  are sensitive to changes in energy prices 
major shifts in the cost of crude oil  the prices of refined products and the cost of natural gas can generate large changes in the operating margin from refining operations 
these prices also determine the carrying value of our refineries inventories 
price risk management activities 
at times  we enter into commodity derivative contracts to manage our price exposure to our inventory positions  purchases of foreign crude oil and consumption of natural gas in the refining process or to fix margins on certain future production 
gains or losses on commodity derivative contracts accounted for as hedges are recognized in the related inventory in inventory of crude oil  products and other on the consolidated balance sheets and ultimately  when the inventory is charged or sold  in raw material  freight and other costs on the consolidated statements of income 
gains and losses on transactions accounted for using mark to market accounting are reflected in other revenues in the consolidated statements of income at each period end
