item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the caption accounting for parts used in refurbishment manufacturing process and in note to our consolidated financial statements 
service as the life and usage of our installed base of light sources in production at chipmakers exceeds the original warranty periods  some chipmakers request service contracts from us 
additionally  we provide billable service or service contracts directly to the three semiconductor lithography tool manufacturers  as well as to chipmaker customers 
these service agreements require us to maintain and or service these light sources either on an on call or regular interval basis or both 
included in some of the types of service contracts we provide to our customers are the replacement of consumable parts and non consumable parts 
the pricing for such contracts includes the replacement of these parts 
in addition to service contracts  we offer cymeronlinetm  a diagnostic and performance software product which delivers critical laser diagnostics and performance information in near real time directly to authorized users anywhere 
the software simplifies reporting and allows users to efficiently manage consumables usage 
cymeronline features a user friendly browser based interface  which features a robust design and provides a secure data environment 
event initiated messages sent to pagers  e mail  mobile phones  or other handheld devices enable up to the minute communication and proactive management 
revenues generated from service and service contracts were approximately million  million and million for  and  respectively 
we expect service and service contract revenues to remain at or exceed these levels as our installed base grows and the warranty period of our light source systems expires 
customers and end users we sell our photolithography light source products to each of the three manufacturers of duv photolithography tools asml canon nikon we believe that maintaining and strengthening customer relationships will play an important role in maintaining our leading position in the photolithography market 
we work closely with our customers to integrate our products into their photolithography tools 
sales to asml  canon  and nikon accounted for  and  respectively  of total revenue in revenues generated from customers within the us were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
revenues generated from customers outside of the us were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
revenues generated from customers located in japan were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
revenues generated from customers located in europe were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
these revenues can originate from any of our locations to customers located in these countries 
long lived assets located in the us were million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
long lived assets located outside of the us were million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
end users of our light sources include all of the world s largest semiconductor manufacturers

backlog we schedule production of light sources based upon order backlog and informal customer forecasts 
we include in backlog only those orders to which a purchase order number has been assigned by the customer and for which delivery has been specified within months 
because customers may cancel or delay orders with little or no penalty  our backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period 
at december   we had a backlog of approximately million compared with a backlog of million at december  manufacturing our manufacturing activities consist of material management  assembly  integration and testing 
these activities are performed in a  square foot facility in san diego  california that includes approximately  square feet of class  cleanroom manufacturing and test space 
in order to focus our own resources  capitalize on the expertise of our key suppliers and respond more efficiently to customer demand  we have outsourced the manufacture of many of our subassemblies 
our manufacturing outsourcing strategy is exemplified by the modular design of our products 
substantially all manufacturing of nonproprietary subassemblies has been contracted to third party suppliers 
as a result  we are increasingly dependent upon these contract suppliers to meet our manufacturing schedules 
the failure by one or more of these suppliers to supply us on a timely basis with sufficient quantities of components or subassemblies that perform to our specifications could affect our ability to deliver completed light sources to our customers on schedule 
we believe that the highly outsourced content and manufacturable design of our products allows for reduced manufacturing cycle times and increased output per employee 
to improve current production efficiencies  control costs  and manage overall manufacturing capacity  we intend to continue to provide additional training to manufacturing personnel  improve our assembly and test processes in order to reduce cycle time  invest in additional manufacturing tooling and further develop our supplier management and engineering capabilities 
in addition to the manufacturing capacity at our facilities in san diego  california  we have a refurbishment facility in korea 
this facility refurbishes discharge chambers for light sources in korea and the asia pacific region 
the refurbishment facility in korea includes  square feet of class  cleanroom manufacturing space 
a limited number of components and subassemblies included in our products are obtained from a single supplier or a small group of suppliers 
for certain optical  control system and pulse power components and subassemblies used in our light source systems  we currently utilize a single supplier 
where possible  we work with secondary suppliers to qualify additional sources of supply 
to reduce the risk associated with this single supplier  we carry significant strategic inventories of these components 
strategic inventories are managed as a percentage of future demand 
we have also negotiated to have vendor managed inventory of critical components to further reduce the risk of a single supplier 
to date we have been able to obtain adequate supplies of the components and subassemblies used in the production of our light source systems in a timely manner from existing sources 
if in the future we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of required materials  components or subassemblies  or if such items do not meet our quality standards  delays or reductions in product shipments could occur which could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
sales and marketing our sales and marketing efforts are designed to serve our customer base consisting of both the duv photolithography tool providers such as asml  canon and nikon as well as many of the world s top chipmakers 
we market and sell our products through our own worldwide direct sales and marketing channels and we have developed product and applications engineering teams to support these efforts 
we believe that in order for our sales and marketing organization to be successful  we must work closely with and understand the requirements of both the photolithography systems solutions providers and the end user semiconductor manufacturers 
service and support we believe our success in the semiconductor photolithography market is highly dependent upon after sales support to both our direct and our end user customers 
we support our customers with field service  technical service engineers and training programs  and provide on site support at the customer s manufacturing facilities 
prior to shipment  our support personnel typically assist the customer in site preparation and inspection and provide customers with training at our facilities or at the customer s location 
we also provide direct customers and end users with a comprehensive set of manuals  including operations  maintenance  service  diagnostic and safety manuals 
our field engineers and technical support specialists provide field service and front line technical support capability from our san diego headquarters  and at our field service offices located throughout the us support in europe  japan  korea  singapore  the people s republic of china  taiwan and southeast asia is provided by our subsidiaries located within those regions 
as part of our customer service  we maintain an inventory of spare parts at each of our service facilities 
as our installed base grows  replacement parts required to satisfy worldwide support requirements  as well as our own logistics support organization  will be subject to the fluctuating demands of the semiconductor industry 
in order to meet these demands  we must continue to effectively manage our production of component modules which are required for new systems  as well as for support and warranty requirements for installed systems 
we believe that the need to provide fast and responsive service that meets the level of quality required by semiconductor manufacturers using our light sources is critical and that we cannot depend solely on our customers to provide this service 
therefore  we believe it is essential to maintain  through our own personnel  a rapid response capability to service our customers and end users throughout the world 
accordingly  we seek to continuously develop and enhance our direct support infrastructure in europe  japan  korea  singapore  the people s republic of china  taiwan and southeast asia and the us this task entails recruiting and training qualified field service personnel or identifying qualified independent firms and maintaining effective and highly trained organizations that can provide service to customers in various countries in their assigned regions 
we generally warrant our new light source products against defects in design  materials  and workmanship 
the warranty period and terms vary by light source model 
we also warrant consumable and spare parts sold to our customers and the coverage period varies by spare part type as some types include time based warranty periods and others include usage based warranty periods 
research and development the semiconductor industry is subject to rapid technological change and new product introductions and enhancements 
we believe that continued and timely development and introduction of new and enhanced light source products are essential for us to maintain our competitive position 
we intend to continue to develop our technology and innovative products to meet customer demands 
current projects include enhancements to our krf and arf light sources and the recently announced development of a recirculating ring based arf light source which provides performance enhancements to our mopa product line 
we have continued to expend significant development efforts to address the technology and products that will be based on the extreme ultraviolet euv technology needed for future generation photolithography illumination sources 
we may also invest in other product and technology areas in order to expand our portfolio within the semiconductor capital equipment market sector 
in addition there are ongoing efforts to improve existing products  reduce manufacturing costs  lower the cost of light source operation  enhance light source performance  develop new features for existing light sources  and conduct research and development of non light source products 
we have historically devoted a significant portion of our financial resources to research and development programs and we expect to continue to allocate significant resources to these efforts 
research and development expenses for  and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
in the last three years  we have entered into several research and development agreements related to euv technology both with customers and government agencies 
the largest of these research and development agreements was with intel corporation in january this agreement provided funding to accelerate the development of production worthy euv lithography light sources at intel s request 
this agreement was terminated in june see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the total funding recorded under this agreement for  and was million  million and  respectively 
revenues generated from research and development contracts amounted to approximately  million and  during  and  respectively 
for certain of our research and development contracts  our research and development expenses are offset by amounts earned associated with these contracts 
the amounts offset against research and development expenses were million  million and  during  and  respectively 
we have established a joint venture with zeiss called tcz which is headquartered in singapore 
the joint venture is owned by us and by zeiss 
tcz is currently developing  and will integrate  market and sell  and support  production tools for the flat panel display manufacturing industry 
the joint venture is targeting the growing market for low temperature poly silicon ltps processing used in the manufacture of liquid crystal displays that are brighter  have higher resolution  and consume less power than displays using today s predominant amorphous silicon films 
we currently expect that tcz will ship its first production tool  the tcz x  in late or early as a majority owned subsidiary  tcz s results  including research and development expenses  are included in our consolidated financial statements 
intellectual property rights while the success of our business depends more on such factors as the technical expertise of our employees  as well as their innovative skills and marketing and customer relations abilities  the success of our business also relies on our ability to protect our proprietary technology 
accordingly  we seek to protect our intellectual property rights in a variety of ways  including by obtaining patents 
as of december   we owned us patents covering certain aspects of technology related to light sources and piezo techniques 
these patents will expire at various times during the period from january to september as of december   we had applied for additional patents in the us as of december   we owned foreign patents and had patent applications pending in various foreign countries 
our pending patent applications and any future applications might not be approved 
our patents might not provide us with a competitive advantage and may be challenged by third parties 
in addition  third parties patents might have an adverse effect on our ability to do business 
due to cost constraints  we did not begin seeking patent protection in japan and other countries for our inventions that are covered by us patents and patent applications until as a result  we do not have the right to seek foreign patent protection for some of our early inventions 
additionally  laws of some foreign countries in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us thus  the likelihood of piracy of our technology and products is greater in these countries 
further  third parties might independently develop similar products  duplicate our products  or design around patents that are granted to us 
other companies or persons may have filed or may file in the future patent applications that are similar or identical to ours 
we may have to participate in appropriate proceedings in the courts or the patent offices to determine the priority of inventions 
these proceedings may determine that these third party patent applications have priority over our patent applications 
loss of priority in these interference proceedings could result in substantial cost to us 
we also rely on trade secret protection  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and other intellectual property protection methods to protect our confidential information and our other intellectual property 
however  we may not be successful in protecting our confidential information  particularly our trade secrets  because third parties may independently develop substantially the same proprietary information and techniques  gain access to our trade secrets  or disclose our technology 
in the past  funds from research and development arrangements with third parties have been used to pay for a portion of our own research and development expenses 
we receive these funds from government sponsored programs and customers  in connection with our designing and developing specific products 
periodically  funds from lithography tool manufacturers and chipmakers are used to fund a small portion of our research and development expenses 
in providing these research and development services to these manufacturers  we try to make clear who owns the intellectual property that results from the research and development services we perform 
however  disputes over the ownership or rights to use or market this intellectual property may arise between the funding organizations and us 
third parties have notified us in the past  and may notify us in the future  that we are infringing their intellectual property rights 
also  we have notified third parties in the past  and may notify them in the future  that they may be infringing our intellectual property rights 
specifically  komatsu notified us in that we may be infringing some of its japanese patents 
during our subsequent discussions  komatsu also asserted that our former japanese manufacturing partner  seiko  or we may be infringing on some of komatsu s us patents and a number of its additional japanese patents 
komatsu has also notified one of our customers  nikon  of its belief that our light sources infringe several of komatsu s japanese and us patents 
as a result  we started proceedings in the japanese patent office to oppose certain patents and patent applications of komatsu 
the japanese patent office has dismissed our opposition claims 
thus  litigation may result in connection with komatsu s japanese patents or us patents 
also  komatsu might claim that we infringe other or additional patents 
komatsu notified seiko that it intends to enforce its rights against seiko with respect to its japanese patents if seiko continued to engage in manufacturing activities for us 
in connection with our former manufacturing agreement with seiko  we agree to pay seiko under certain conditions for damages associated with these types of claims 
seiko may not prevail in any litigation against komatsu  and therefore  we may be required to pay seiko for such damages 
we have notified our competitor and others of our us patent portfolio 
specifically  we have notified komatsu that it may be infringing some of our us patents 
we have discussed with komatsu our claims against each other 
komatsu challenged one of our us patents in the united states patent and trademark office uspto but our patent was subsequently re issued by the uspto 
also  komatsu transferred its lithography light source business to our competitor  gigaphoton 
we also have had discussions with a former competitor  lambda physik a subsidiary of coherent  inc  regarding allegations by each party against the other for possible patent infringement 
any of these discussions with our competitor or former competitor may not be successful and litigation could result 
in the future  patent litigation may result due to a claim of infringement by our competitor or any other third party or may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us 
any such litigation could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our effort  which would have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
furthermore  our customers and the end users of our products might assert other claims for indemnification that arise from infringement claims against them 
if these assertions are successful  our business  financial condition and operating results may be materially affected 
instead of litigation  or as a result thereof  we may seek a license from third parties to use their intellectual property 
however  we may not be able to obtain a license 
alternatively  we may design around the third party s intellectual property rights or we may challenge these claims in legal proceedings 
any adverse determination in a legal proceeding could result in one or more of the following  any of which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results loss of our proprietary rights  exposure to significant liabilities by other third parties  requirement that we get a license from third parties on terms that are not favorable  or restriction from manufacturing or selling our products 
any of these actions could be costly and would divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel  which would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in  we granted seiko a right of first refusal to fund our development of  and receive a license to  new industrial light source technologies not developed with funding from other parties 
in exchange for these rights  we received up front license fees of million in aggregate during and we were also entitled to royalties of on related product sales through september  after which the royalty rate was subject to renegotiation 
to date no renegotiation of the royalty rate has occurred and we have earned no royalties under the agreement 
the license agreement also provides that product sales between us and seiko will be at a discount from the respective companies list prices 
the agreement terminates in august there has been no production or sales activity by seiko associated with this contract to date and this contract does not apply to our current light source system products 
we have registered the trademarks cymer and insist on cymer and others in the us and in some other countries 
we are also trying to register additional trademarks in the us and in other countries 
we use these trademarks and many other marks in our advertisements and other business materials  which are distributed throughout the world 
we may be subject to trademark infringement actions for using these marks and other marks on a worldwide basis and this would be costly to defend 
if a trademark infringement action were successful  we would have to stop using the mark and possibly pay damages 
competition we believe that the principal elements of competition in our markets are the technical performance characteristics of the excimer light source products and the operating efficiency of the system  which is based on availability  reliability  performance efficiency  throughput  cost of operation  and rate of quality 
we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors 
we currently have one significant competitor that sells light sources for duv photolithography applications 
this competitor  gigaphoton  is a joint venture between two large companies  komatsu and ushio  and is headquartered in japan 
gigaphoton is aggressively trying to gain larger market penetration in the excimer light source industry 
we know that our lithography tool manufacturer customers have purchased products from this competitor and that these customers have approved this competitor s light sources for use with their products 
additionally  we know that gigaphoton has been approved by a number of chipmakers in japan and other regions in asia  as well as a few chipmakers in the us  and that gigaphoton has an installed base of light sources at chipmakers in these regions 
in the future  we will likely experience competition from other companies as well  as next generation technologies must be adopted in order to enable critical dimensions to continue to shrink beyond the nm node 
these technologies include euv  an area in which we have been conducting research and development since and for which we currently have a very promising light source in development  and possibly nano imprint lithography or certain types of maskless lithography  such as multiple electron beam direct write lithography 
to remain competitive  we believe that we will need to manufacture and deliver products to customers on a timely basis without significant defects and maintain a high level of investment in research and development and sales and marketing 
we might not have sufficient resources to continue to make the investments necessary to maintain our competitive position 
larger companies with substantially greater resources  such as other manufacturers of industrial light sources for advanced lithography  may attempt to sell competitive products to our customers 
potential competitors may also be attracted to our growing installed base of light sources and may attempt to supply consumables and spare parts to that installed base 
employees on december   we employed persons worldwide 
no employees are currently covered by collective bargaining agreements or are members of any labor organization as far as we are aware 
we have not experienced any work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good

item a 
risk factors the risks described below may not be the only risks we face 
additional risks that we do not currently think are material may also impair our business operations 
if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could suffer  and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
our revenues and operating results from quarter to quarter have varied in the past and our future operating results may continue to fluctuate significantly 
factors that contribute to fluctuations in our revenues and operating results include demand for semiconductors in general and  in particular  for leading edge devices with smaller circuit geometries  cyclicality in the market for semiconductor manufacturing equipment  rates at which chipmakers take delivery of photolithography tools from lithography tool manufacturers  rates at which lithography tool manufacturer customers take delivery of light source systems from us  timing and size of orders from our customers  changes in market penetration by our competitor  product lead time demands from our customers  mix of light source models  consumable and spare parts and service revenues in our total revenues  changes in the price and profitability of our products  our ability to develop and implement new technologies and introduce new products  utilization rates of light sources and sales of consumable and spare parts and services  our ability to manage customer satisfaction  product reliability  and direct field service and support effectiveness  our ability to manage our manufacturing requirements  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  principally with respect to the japanese yen in which sales by our japanese subsidiary are denominated  worldwide political instability  changing global economic conditions  including rising energy prices  and intellectual property protection 
we have historically derived a large portion of our quarterly and annual revenues from selling a small number of light source systems 
because we sell a small number of products  the precise time that we recognize revenue from an order may have a significant impact on our total revenue for a particular period 
our customers may cancel or reschedule orders with little or no penalty 
orders expected in one quarter could shift to another period due to changes in the anticipated timing of our customers purchase decisions or rescheduled delivery dates requested by our customers 
our operating results for a particular quarter or year may be adversely affected if our customers  particularly our three largest customers  cancel or reschedule orders  or if we cannot fill orders in time due to unexpected delays in manufacturing  testing  shipping  and product acceptance 
we manage our expense levels based  in large part  on expected future revenues 
as a result  our expenses are relatively fixed for the short term  and if our actual revenue decreases below the level we expect  our operating results will be adversely affected 
as a result of these or other factors  we could fail to achieve our expectations as to future revenue  gross profit  operating income  net income  earnings per share  and cash flows 
our failure to meet the performance expectations set and published by external sources could result in a sudden and significant drop in the price of our stock  particularly on a short term basis  and could negatively affect the value of any investment in our stock 
our business depends on the semiconductor and the semiconductor capital equipment industries  which are highly volatile and unpredictable 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from lithography tool manufacturers who  as original equipment manufacturers oems  incorporate our light source systems in photolithography tools that they sell to semiconductor manufacturers  or chipmakers  and from chipmakers who purchase consumables  spare parts  upgrades and service directly from us in support of the light source products 
like us  our oem customers depend on demand for their products from the chipmakers 
the capital equipment and related operating expenditures of chipmakers depend on a number of factors  including the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and the many products using semiconductors 
that demand is highly volatile and unpredictable 
as a result of the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry  the semiconductor capital equipment industry historically has experienced periodic ups and downs 
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor and the semiconductor capital equipment industries affects our ability to accurately predict future revenue and therefore our ability to manage our future expense levels 
when cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels  operating results may be adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary in order for us to remain competitive and financially sound 
during a down cycle or slowdown  we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions while still being able to maintain the longer term strategies of the company as well as motivate and retain our key employees 
during periods of rapid growth  we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand 
we can provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry cycles 
we are not able to predict with any certainty the duration of any industry cycle or the timing or order of magnitude of any recovery 
downturns in the semiconductor industry often result in decreases in demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment  including the photolithography tools that our oem customers produce 
downturns in the semiconductor industry have generally had severe effects on the demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment and the associated parts and support services 
fluctuating levels of investment by chipmakers and resulting pricing volatility will continue to materially affect our aggregate bookings  revenues and operating results 
even during periods of reduced revenues we believe we must continue to invest in research and development and to maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive 
continued spending in furtherance of these objectives may temporarily harm our financial results 
semiconductor industry downturns and slowdowns are likely to continue to adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results  and our operating results may fall below the expectations of public market analysts or investors in future quarters 
any failure to meet such expectations could materially adversely affect the price of our common stock 
our oem customers try to manage their inventories and production requirements to appropriate levels that reflect their expected sales to chipmakers 
market conditions in the semiconductor industry and our oem customers production efficiency can cause them to expand or reduce their orders for new light source systems as they try to manage their inventories and production requirements 
we continue to work with our oem customers to better understand these issues 
however  we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in understanding our oem customers inventory management and production requirements or that our oem customers will not build up an excess inventory of light source systems 
if our oem customers retain an excess inventory of light source systems  our revenue could be reduced in future periods as the excess inventory is utilized  which could adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
if our oem customers demand shorter product lead times to improve their inventory and cash positions  our inventory management and cash position may be negatively impacted  which may adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
a significant percentage of our revenue is derived from sales to the three lithography tool manufacturers  and if we are not able to retain these customers  or they reschedule  reduce or cancel orders  or delay or default on payments  our revenues would be reduced and our financial condition and cash flows would suffer 
three large companies  asml  canon and nikon dominate the photolithography tool business 
collectively  these three companies accounted for the following percentage of our total revenue during the periods indicated years ended december  asml canon nikon total collectively  these three companies accounted for the following percentage of our total accounts receivable at the dates indicated december  december  asml canon nikon total we expect that sales of our light source products to these three customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future 
none of our customers are obligated to purchase a minimum number of our products in the aggregate or during any particular period 
we can provide no assurance that any of our customers will continue to purchase our products at past or current levels 
for example  revenue attributable to sales to canon has declined significantly since sales to canon or any of these customers may be affected by many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include a change in a customer s competitive position in its industry  a customer experiencing lithography tool production problems  a decision to purchase light sources from other suppliers  changes in economic conditions in the semiconductor or the photolithography tool industries  and a decline in a customer s financial condition 
the loss of any significant business from or production problems for any one of these three customers would harm our business and financial condition 
a substantial percentage of our revenue is derived from the sale of a limited number of primary products 
our only current product line is excimer light source systems  including krf and arf systems  and support  including consumable and spare parts and service support 
we expect these light source systems and the related support to continue to account for a substantial majority of our revenues in the near term 
continued market acceptance of our light source system products is  therefore  critical to our future success 
the primary market for excimer light sources is in the use of duv photolithography equipment for manufacturing deep submicron semiconductor devices using smaller circuit geometries 
the demand for our products depends in part on the rate at which chipmakers further adopt excimer light sources as the chosen light source for their photolithography tools 
the rate with which chipmakers adopt excimer light sources may vary for a variety of reasons  including inadequate performance of photoresists used in advanced duv photolithography  especially new arf immersion specific resists  potential shortages of specialized materials used in duv optics  productivity of arf immersion lithography tools  and in the future  productivity of double patterning arf lithography tools  and consolidation of chipmakers 
we cannot guarantee that these factors can or will be overcome or that the demand for our excimer light source products will not be materially reduced 
the demand for our light source products  and therefore our operating results  financial condition and cash flows  could be adversely affected by a number of factors  including a decline in demand for our customers duv photolithography tools  a failure to achieve continued market acceptance of our products  a failure to manage customer satisfaction  product reliability  and direct field service and support effectiveness  an improved version of products being offered by a competitor in the market in which we participate  technological change that we are unable to address with our products  and a failure to release new enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis 
we depend on the introduction of new products for our success  and we are subject to risks associated with rapid technological change 
rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances enabling such processes 
we believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop  manufacture  timely introduce and support new light source products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing light source systems and process capabilities 
due to the risks inherent in transitioning to new products  we must forecast accurate demand for new products while managing the transition from older products 
our most significant product introduction in recent years consisted of a technology change from a single discharge chamber excimer light source to a dual discharge chamber design called mopa 
the mopa design represents a paradigm shift from previously accepted lithography technology and offers chipmakers higher power  tighter bandwidth and lower cost of operation for their current and we expect for their future optical lithography applications 
as originally designed  the mopa architecture was projected to provide its benefits across all three duv wavelengths nm  nm  and nm but at this time  the semiconductor industry has only adopted mopa at the nm wavelength  due to the successful extension of nm single chamber technology  and the omission of nm lithography from the roadmap 
there are risks inherent in the mopa technology  including effective execution of our product development roadmap  continuing adoption of the product by lithography tool manufacturers and chipmakers  manufacturability  cost effectiveness  and product performance in the field of the new products and the development of a comparable product by our competitor 
at this time  chipmakers are continuing to expand their manufacturing capacity at nm  and a growing number of chipmakers are ramping up production capability at nm  while manufacturers of certain types of memory chips are in the early stages of arf immersion production below nm and a significant level of development is underway at nm 
these efforts  along with expanding use of arf immersion lithography in production among certain memory manufacturers  are driving demand for our most advanced arf light sources 
at the same time chipmakers also need tools for the less critical layers on wafers  and there remains strong demand for our krf light source products for duv photolithography systems as well 
after chipmakers have built their capacity to levels appropriate to meet existing demand  their demand for our light source products will depend  in part  on their sales forecasts and their estimates regarding the duration and magnitude of the current industry cycle and whether their projected manufacturing process yields will enable ongoing investments in whatever capacity seems necessary 
future technologies such as euv  nano imprint lithography  and certain maskless lithography techniques may render our excimer light source products obsolete 
we must manage product transitions  as introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products 
if new products are not introduced on time  or have reliability or quality problems  our performance may be impacted by reduced orders  higher manufacturing costs  delays in acceptance of and payment for new products  and additional service and warranty expenses 
we may not be able to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to our existing products and processes in a timely or cost effective manner that satisfies customer needs or achieves market acceptance 
failure to develop and introduce these new products and enhancements could materially adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
we expect to face significant competition from current and future competitors 
we believe that other companies are developing systems and products that are competitive to ours and are planning to introduce new products to this market  which may affect our ability to sell our new products 
furthermore  new products represent significant investments of our resources and their success  or lack thereof  could have a material effect on our financial results 
failure to maintain effectively our direct field service and support organization could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we believe it is critical for us to provide quick and responsive service directly to the chipmakers throughout the world that use our light source products in their photolithography systems  and that it is essential to maintain our own personnel or trained third party resources to provide these services 
accordingly  we have an ongoing effort to develop our direct support system with locations in europe  korea  japan  the people s republic of china  singapore  taiwan and the us this requires us to do the following recruit and train qualified field service personnel  identify qualified independent firms  and maintain effective and highly trained organizations that can provide service to our customers in various countries 
we may not be able to attract and train qualified personnel to maintain our direct support operations successfully 
we may not be able to find and engage qualified third party resources to supplement and enhance our direct support operations 
further  we may incur significant costs in providing these support services 
failure to implement our direct support operation effectively could harm our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
we must develop and manufacture enhancements to our existing products and introduce new products in order to continue to grow our business 
we may not effectively manage our growth and integrate these new enhancements and products  which could materially harm our business 
to continue to grow our business  our existing light source products and their process capabilities must be enhanced  and we must develop and manufacture new products to serve other semiconductor applications 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to manage our business to grow effectively 
nor can we guarantee that we will be able to accelerate the development of new enhancements to our existing products and create new products 
further  we may not be able to effectively integrate new products and applications into our current operations 
any of these risks could materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we must effectively manage changes in our business 
in order to respond to the business cycles of the semiconductor industry  in the past few years we have sharply expanded and contracted the scope of our operations and the number of employees in many of our locations and departments 
as the semiconductor industry cycle moves between growth and contraction we will need to improve our product reliability through quality control  and our order fulfillment  field service and customer support capabilities  closely manage our global operations  improve our process and other internal management systems  quickly adapt to changing sales and marketing channels  effectively manage our inventory levels  and attract  train  retain and manage key personnel 
if we fail to effectively manage changes in our business  our operating results  financial condition and cash flows will be adversely affected 
we depend on a few key suppliers for purchasing components and subassemblies that are included in our products 
we purchase a limited number of components and subassemblies included in our light source products from a single supplier or a small group of suppliers 
for certain optical  control system and pulse power components and subassemblies used in our light source systems  we currently utilize a single supplier 
to reduce the risk associated with this single supplier  we carry a significant strategic inventory of these components 
strategic inventories are managed as a percentage of future demand 
we have also negotiated to have vendor managed inventory of critical components to further reduce the risk of a single supplier 
in addition  we contract the manufacture of various subassemblies of our products and depend on our contract manufacturers to deliver to our required specifications  schedule  and quality standards 
further  some of our suppliers have specialized in supplying equipment or manufacturing services to semiconductor equipment manufacturers and therefore are susceptible to industry ups and downs and subject to the same risks and uncertainties regarding their ability to respond to changing market conditions 
because many of these suppliers reduce the size of their workforce in an industry downturn and increase it in an upturn  they may not be able to meet our requirements or respond quickly enough as an upturn begins and gains momentum 
due to the nature of our product development requirements  these key suppliers must rapidly advance their own technologies and production capabilities in order to support the introduction schedule of our new products 
these suppliers may not be able to provide new modules and subassemblies when they are needed to satisfy our product schedule requirements 
if we cannot purchase enough of these materials  components or subassemblies  or if these items do not meet our quality standards  there could be delays or reductions in our product shipments  which would harm our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
we are dependent on our manufacturing facilities and subcontractors to assemble and test our products 
operations at our primary manufacturing facility and our subcontractors are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons  including work stoppages  terrorism  fire  earthquake  energy shortages  flooding or other natural disasters 
such disruptions could cause delays in shipments of our products to our customers 
we provide no assurance that alternate production capacity would be available if a major disruption were to occur or that  if it were available  it could be obtained on favorable terms 
such disruption could result in cancellation of orders or loss of customers  which would have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
we face competition from one company and may face competition from additional competitors who enter the market 
we currently have one significant competitor that sells light sources for duv photolithography applications 
this competitor  gigaphoton  is a joint venture between two large companies  komatsu and ushio  and is headquartered in japan 
gigaphoton is aggressively trying to gain larger market penetration in the excimer light source industry 
we know that our customers have purchased products from this competitor and that our customers have approved this competitor s light sources for use with their products 
larger companies with substantially greater resources  such as other manufacturers of industrial light sources for advanced lithography  may attempt to sell competitive products to our customers 
potential competitors may also be attracted to our growing installed base of light sources which represents a steady and significant consumable and spare parts revenue stream for us  and they may attempt to supply consumable and spare parts to that installed base 
if any existing or future competitors gain market acceptance  we could lose market share and our growth could slow or decline  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
we depend on key personnel  especially management and technical personnel  who may be difficult to attract and retain 
we are highly dependent on the services of many key employees in various areas  including research and development  engineering  sales and marketing  field service and support  manufacturing  and management 
in particular  there are a limited number of experts in excimer light source technology  and we require highly skilled hardware and software engineers 
competition for qualified personnel is intense and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel as needed 
we do not have employment agreements with most of our employees 
we believe that our future growth and operating results will depend on the continued services of our research and development  engineering  sales and marketing  field service and support  manufacturing  and management personnel  our ability to attract  train and retain highly skilled key personnel  and the ability of our personnel and key employees to continue to expand  train and manage our employee base 
if we are unable to hire  train and retain key personnel as required  our operating results  financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 
economic  political  regulatory and other events in geographic areas where we have significant sales or operations could interfere with our business 
we serve an increasingly global market 
a large portion of our total revenues is derived from customers located outside of the us we expect our international sales to continue to account for a very large portion of our total revenues 
in order to support our foreign customers  we maintain a manufacturing and field service subsidiary in korea as well as field service and support subsidiaries in japan  the netherlands  the people s republic of china  singapore and taiwan 
we may not be able to manage our operations to address and support our global customers effectively 
further  our investments in these types of activities may not make us competitive in the global market or we may not be able to meet the service  support  and manufacturing levels required by our global customers 
additionally  we are subject to the risks inherent in doing business globally  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  fluctuations in exchange rates and currency controls  political and economic conditions and instability  imposition of trade barriers and restrictions  including changes in tariff and freight rates  foreign customs and duties  difficulty in coordinating our management and operations in several different countries  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary and branch operations  limited intellectual property protection in some countries  potentially adverse tax consequences in some countries  the possibility of accounts receivable collection difficulties  in the case of asia  the risk of business interruption and damage from earthquakes  the effect of acts of terrorism and war  and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws 
many of our major customers and many of the chipmakers who use our light source products in their photolithography systems are located in asia 
economic problems and currency fluctuations affecting these regions in asia could create a larger risk for us 
further  even though it has not been difficult for us to comply with us export controls  these export rules could change in the future and make it more difficult or impossible for us to export our products to many countries 
any of these vulnerabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to compete could be jeopardized if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights 
these types of claims could seriously harm our business or require us to incur significant costs 
we believe our success and ability to compete depend in large part upon protecting our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights 
as of december   we owned us patents covering certain aspects of technology related to light sources and piezo techniques 
these patents will expire at various times during the period from january to september as of december   we had applied for additional patents in the us as of december   we owned foreign patents and had patent applications pending in various foreign countries 
our pending patent applications and any future applications might not be approved 
our patents might not provide us with a competitive advantage and may be challenged by third parties 
in addition  third parties patents might have an adverse effect on our ability to do business 
as a result of cost constraints  we did not begin seeking patent protection in japan and other countries for our inventions that are covered by us patents and patent applications until as a result we do not have the right to seek foreign patent protection for some of our early inventions 
additionally  laws of some foreign countries in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us thus  the likelihood of piracy of our technology and products is greater in these countries 
further  third parties might independently develop similar products  duplicate our products  or design around patents that are granted to us 
other companies or persons may have filed or may file in the future patent applications that are similar or identical to ours 
we may have to participate in appropriate proceedings in the courts or the patent offices to determine the priority of inventions 
these proceedings may determine that these third party patent applications have priority over our patent applications 
loss of priority in these interference proceedings could result in substantial cost to us 
we also rely on the following to protect our confidential information and our other intellectual property trade secret protection  employee nondisclosure agreements  third party nondisclosure agreements  and other intellectual property protection methods 
however  we may not be successful in protecting our confidential information and intellectual property  particularly our trade secrets  because third parties may independently develop substantially the same proprietary information and techniques  gain access to our trade secrets  or disclose our technology 
the parties to whom we provide research and development services may dispute the ownership of the intellectual property that we develop performing these services 
in the past  funds from research and development arrangements with third parties have been used to pay for a portion of our own research and development expenses 
we receive these funds from government sponsored programs and customers  in connection with our designing and developing specific products 
periodically  funds from lithography tool manufacturers and chipmakers are used to fund a small portion of our research and development expenses 
in providing these research and development services to these manufacturers  we try to make clear who owns the intellectual property that results from the research and development services we perform 
however  disputes over the ownership or rights to use or market this intellectual property may arise between the funding organizations and us 
any dispute over ownership of the intellectual property we develop could restrict our ability to market our products and have a material adverse effect on our business 
in the future  we may be subject to patent litigation to enforce patents issued to us and defend ourselves against claimed infringement by our competitor or any other third party 
third parties have notified us in the past  and may notify us in the future  that we are infringing their intellectual property rights 
also  we have notified third parties in the past  and may notify them in the future  that they may be infringing our intellectual property rights 
specifically  komatsu notified us in that we may be infringing some of its japanese patents 
during our subsequent discussions  komatsu also asserted that our former japanese manufacturing partner  seiko  or we may be infringing on some of komatsu s us patents and a number of its additional japanese patents 
komatsu has also notified one of our customers  nikon  of its belief that our light sources infringe several of komatsu s japanese and us patents 
as a result  we started proceedings in the japanese patent office to oppose certain patents and patent applications of komatsu 
the japanese patent office has dismissed our opposition claims 
thus  litigation may result in connection with komatsu s japanese patents or us patents 
also  komatsu might claim that we infringe other or additional patents 
komatsu notified seiko that it intends to enforce its rights against seiko with respect to its japanese patents if seiko continued to engage in manufacturing activities for us 
in connection with our former manufacturing agreement with seiko  we agreed to pay seiko under certain conditions for damages associated with these types of claims 
seiko may not prevail in any litigation against komatsu  and therefore  we may be required to pay seiko for such damages 
we have notified our competitor and others of our us patent portfolio 
specifically  we have notified komatsu that it may be infringing some of our us patents 
we have discussed with komatsu our claims against each other 
komatsu challenged one of our us patents in the united states patent and trademark office uspto but our patent was subsequently re issued by the uspto 
also  komatsu transferred its lithography light source business to our competitor  gigaphoton 
we also have had discussions with a former competitor  lambda physik a subsidiary of coherent  inc  regarding allegations by each party against the other for possible patent infringement 
any of these discussions with our competitor or former competitor may not be successful and litigation could result 
in the future  patent litigation may result due to a claim of infringement by our competitor or any other third party or may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us 
any such litigation could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our effort  which would have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
furthermore  our customers and the end users of our products might assert other claims for indemnification that arise from infringement claims against them 
if these assertions are successful  our business  financial condition and operating results may be materially affected 
instead of litigation  or as a result thereof  we may seek a license from third parties to use their intellectual property 
however  we may not be able to obtain a license 
alternatively  we may design around the third party s intellectual property rights or we may challenge these claims in legal proceedings 
any adverse determination in a legal proceeding could result in one or more of the following  any of which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results loss of our proprietary rights  exposure to significant liabilities by other third parties  requirement that we get a license from third parties on terms that are not favorable to us  or restriction from manufacturing or selling our products 
any of these actions could be costly and would divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel  which would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may acquire a business or enter a new market that will involve numerous risks 
we may not be able to address these risks successfully without substantial expense  delay or other operational and financial challenges 
the risks involved with acquiring a new company  forming a joint venture  or entering a new market include the following diversion of management s attention and resources to integrate the new company or new business opportunity  failure to retain key personnel  client dissatisfaction or performance problems with the acquired company or new product in a new market  amortization of acquired definite lived intangible assets and deferred compensation  costs associated with acquisitions and joint ventures and the integration of acquired operations  costs associated with developing  marketing  introducing and supporting a new product in a new market  failure to commercialize purchased technologies  ability of the acquired companies  joint ventures or new markets to meet their financial projections  assumption of unknown liabilities or other unanticipated events or circumstances  and compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations  nasdaq stock market rules and new accounting pronouncements as they relate to the new company or joint venture 
mergers  acquisitions and joint ventures  as well as entry into new markets  are inherently subject to multiple significant risks  and the inability to effectively manage these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in july  we formed our tcz joint venture with zeiss to produce tools for the manufacture of flat panel displays 
this is a new market for both cymer and zeiss and may involve numerous risks 
any of these risks could materially harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
further  any business that we acquire  joint venture that we form or new market we may enter may not achieve anticipated revenues or operating results 
compliance with changing regulations of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses 
changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations  including accelerated sec filing timelines and new proxy rules  new nasdaq stock market rules  and new accounting pronouncements are creating uncertainty and additional complexities for companies such as ours 
in particular  the section internal control evaluation requirements under the sarbanes oxley act have added and will continue to add complexity and costs to our business and require a significant investment of our time and resources to complete each year 
we take these requirements seriously and expect to continue to make every effort to ensure that we receive clean attestations on our internal controls each year from our outside auditors 
to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure  we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with all other evolving standards 
these investments may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from strategic revenue generating and cost management activities 
decreased effectiveness of equity compensation could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees  and changes in accounting for equity compensation could adversely affect earnings 
we have historically used broad based stock option programs and other forms of equity related incentives as a key component of our employee compensation packages 
we believe that stock options and other long term equity incentives directly motivate a broader base of employees to maximize long term stockholder value and  through the use of long term vesting  encourage employees to remain with us 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas no 
r  share based payment an amendment to statement nos 
and  which we adopted on january  this rule requires us to record an expense to earnings for employee stock option grants and other equity incentives 
moreover  applicable stock exchange listing standards relating to obtaining stockholder approval of equity compensation plans has made it more difficult and expensive for us to grant options to employees  which has resulted in changes to our equity compensation strategy  including a significant reduction in the number of stock options granted to employees 
we have developed alternative cash compensation arrangements for our employees to replace the majority of these stock option programs and may be required to offer additional alternative cash compensation arrangements in the future 
these and other developments in the provision of equity compensation to employees could make it more difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees  and such a change in accounting rules and alternative cash compensation programs may adversely impact our future operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
we are dependent on air transport to conduct our business and disruption of domestic and international air transport systems could adversely affect our business 
we depend on regular and reliable air transportation on a worldwide basis for many of our routine business functions 
if civil aviation in the us or abroad is disrupted by terrorist activities or security responses to the threat of terrorism or for any other reason  our business could be adversely affected in the following ways supplies of raw materials and components for the manufacture of our products or our customers products may be disrupted  we may not be able to deliver our products to our customers in a timely manner  we may not be able to provide timely service of or support for installed light sources for chipmakers  and our sales and marketing efforts may be disrupted 
we are exposed to risks related to the fluctuations in the currency exchange rates for all foreign currencies in which we do business  but particularly for the japanese yen 
when we sell products to our japanese subsidiary  the sale is denominated in us dollars 
when our japanese subsidiary sells our products directly to customers in japan  the sale is denominated in japanese yen 
thus  our results of operations may fluctuate based on the changing value of the japanese yen to the us dollar 
we manage the exposure of our japanese subsidiary to these fluctuations through forward contracts to hedge the subsidiary s purchase commitments 
we will continue to monitor our exposure to these currency fluctuations  and  when appropriate  use hedging transactions to minimize the effect of these currency fluctuations 
however  exchange rate fluctuations may still have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
in the future  we may need to sell a more significant portion of our products in foreign currencies other than the japanese yen and the management of more currency fluctuations will be more difficult and expose us to greater risks in this area 
we are subject to many standards and regulations of foreign governments and  even though we intend to comply  we may not always be in compliance with these rules  or we may be unable to design or redesign our products to comply with these rules 
many foreign government standards and regulations apply to our products 
these standards and regulations are always being amended 
although we intend to meet all foreign standards and regulations  our products may not comply with these foreign government standards and regulations 
further  it might not be cost effective for us to redesign our products to comply with these foreign government standards and regulations 
our inability to design products to comply with foreign standards therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business 
chipmakers prolonged use of our products in high volume production may not produce the results they desire and  as a result  our reputation and that of our customers who supply photolithography tools to the chipmakers could be damaged in the semiconductor industry 
over time  our light source products may not meet chipmakers production specifications or operating cost requirements after the light source has been used for a long period in high volume production 
if any chipmaker cannot successfully achieve or sustain their volume production using our light sources  our reputation could be damaged with chipmakers and lithography tool manufacturers 
this would harm our business 
our operations are subject to environmental and other government regulations that may expose us to liabilities for noncompliance 
we are subject to federal  state and local regulations  such as regulations related to the environment  land use  public utility utilization and the fire code  in connection with the storage  handling  discharge and disposal of substances that we use in our manufacturing process and on our facilities 
we believe that our activities comply with current government regulations that are applicable to our operations and current facilities 
we may be required to purchase additional capital equipment or other requirements for our processes to comply with these government regulations in the future if they change 
further  these government regulations may restrict us from expanding our operations 
adopting measures to comply with changes in the government regulations  our failure to comply with environmental and land use regulations  or restrictions on our ability to discharge hazardous substances  could subject us to future liability or cause our manufacturing operations to be reduced or stopped 
our products are subject to potential product liability claims if personal injury or death results from their use 
we are exposed to significant risks for product liability claims if personal injury or death results from the use of our products 
we may experience material product liability losses in the future 
we maintain insurance against product liability claims 
however  our insurance coverage may not continue to be available on terms that we accept 
this insurance coverage also may not adequately cover liabilities that we incur 
further  if our products are defective  we may be required to recall or redesign these products 
a successful claim against us that exceeds our insurance coverage level  or any claim or product recall that results in adverse publicity against us  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
trademark infringement claims against our registered and unregistered trademarks would be expensive and we may have to stop using such trademarks and pay damages 
we registered the trademarks cymer and insist on cymer and others in the us and in some other countries 
we are also trying to register additional trademarks in the us and in other countries 
we use these trademarks and many other marks in our advertisements and other business materials  which are distributed throughout the world 
we may be subject to trademark infringement actions for using these marks and other marks on a worldwide basis which would be costly to defend 
if a trademark infringement action were successful  we would have to stop using one or more of the marks and possibly pay damages 
the price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate widely 
the price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past 
the market price of our common stock will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations in the future in response to a variety of factors  including the risk factors contained in this report 
various factors may significantly affect the market price of our common stock  including the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  including our net income  product gross margins and free cash flow  conditions and trends in the light source device and other technology industries  announcements of innovations in technology  new products offered by us or our competitor  developments of patents or proprietary rights  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  general worldwide political  economic  and market conditions  us political  economic  and market conditions  and failure to properly manage any single or combination of risk factors listed in this section 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market price for many high technology companies 
such fluctuations have in some cases been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
severe price fluctuations in a company s stock have frequently been followed by securities litigation 
any such litigation can result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations

overview we are the world s leading supplier of light source solutions for the semiconductor industry 
our products provide the essential light source for duv photolithography systems 
almost all consumer electronic devices manufactured in the last several years contain a semiconductor manufactured using light sources such as ours 
we currently supply light sources to all three lithography tool manufacturers  asml  canon  and nikon  who in turn supply their wafer steppers and scanners to chipmakers 
in addition  we sell replacement parts and services to the lithography tool manufacturers as well as directly to the chipmakers 
our light source systems currently constitute a substantial majority of all excimer light sources incorporated in lithography stepper and scanner tools 
our headquarters are located in san diego  california where we develop and manufacture all of our light source systems and the majority of our replacement parts 
as a large portion of our revenue is derived from customers located outside of the us  we maintain a spare parts refurbishment facility and field service office in korea and field service and support offices in japan  the netherlands  the people s republic of china  singapore and taiwan 
japan is currently our only subsidiary office that sells excimer light source systems 
we also maintain field service offices in the us to service our installed base of light sources located in the us our tcz joint venture which is headquartered in singapore  is currently developing  and will integrate  market and sell  and support production tools for the flat panel display manufacturing industry 
the joint venture is targeting the growing market for ltps processing used in the manufacture of liquid crystal displays that are brighter  have higher resolution  and consume less power than displays using today s predominant amorphous silicon films 
although tcz s product is currently in the development phase  tcz performed extensive customer demonstrations on its first generation demonstration tool in and we expect that tcz will ship its first production tool  the tcz x  in late or early since we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from lithography tool manufacturers  we are subject to the volatile and unpredictable nature of the semiconductor industry 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical in nature and historically has experienced periodic ups and downs  and the activities of the last several years illustrate this cyclicality 
in  the semiconductor industry experienced strong growth  which was followed by a three year downturn from through late growth resumed in late  but one year later  in late  the industry again declined for several months 
business activity then leveled off early in and began to slightly improve quarter over quarter thereafter until late  when orders for our light sources increased substantially from the levels seen earlier in the year 
our chipmaker customers began indicating that increasing demand for chips would require them to expand production capacity  and our lithography tool manufacturing customers began placing orders for a growing number of light sources to meet increasing demand for scanners 
by the end of  it appeared that we were again entering a strong industry growth cycle and upturn 
there were many positive indicators throughout that reinforced our viewpoint that we had entered an upturn in the semiconductor industry  which included strong continuing demand for our arf light sources as chipmakers purchased systems to enable production at advanced technology nodes 
stronger than anticipated demand for our krf light sources  which chipmakers purchased to expand production capacity and pattern a growing number of less critical layers with duv light sources 
substantial ongoing growth in our non systems revenue which was driven by high light source utilization at chipmakers and high overall fab utilization 
as a result of these strong demand trends  our bookings  revenue and profits grew substantially in compared to in  we achieved record total revenue of million  a increase over total revenue of million in utilization of our light source systems at chipmakers also continued to increase in compared to this increased utilization when coupled with our growing installed base of light sources systems drove our non systems product revenue  which consists of consumables and spare parts  upgrades  and service  to a record million for  equal to of total revenue for the year 
this was a increase over the million in non systems revenue in operating income climbed to a record million  yielding an operating margin of for the year  compared to operating income of million and operating margin of 
net income for also reached a record high of million  equal to per share fully diluted  compared to net income of million  equal to per share fully diluted  in our strong financial performance in allowed us to continue investing heavily in developing advanced duv technologies to meet our customers next generation requirements 
it also allowed us to make progress on our longer term growth initiatives such as euv development and the activities of our tcz joint venture 
demand for our most advanced arf light sources grew more than in compared to  and we shipped a total of of our xla series light sources during the year 
in  lithography tool manufacturing customers ramped up their first wave of arf immersion scanner production 
many of the immersion tools delivered earlier in were used primarily by chipmakers for process development purposes including defect reduction 
as chipmakers experienced success in qualifying their immersion production processes  they moved these tools from qualification into full production  and will augment them with additional immersion tool purchases to increase critical layer capacity 
at this time  immersion lithography is a production reality at a number of chipmakers fabs  and our expectation is that a growing number of chipmakers will adopt this advanced production technique over the next several years 
in general  industry trends that affect lithography are positive 
leading nand flash memory manufacturers began using arf immersion lithography in production near the end of  and we anticipate that demand for immersion tools should grow this year as they continue to drive production with smaller cds and expand the number of layers they need to pattern with arf immersion tools 
demand in the dynamic random access memory dram segment of the market is strong  driven by the transition to more advanced types of memory chips and by the large memory requirements of the microsoft vista operating system 
foundries are primarily making technology buys rather than expanding capacity  but indications from the foundries and lithography tool manufacturers point toward additional capacity driven growth in equipment orders beginning in the next few quarters 
demand from integrated device manufacturers idms remains healthy and should be stable over the near and mid term 
although fab utilization experienced a slight decline late in  fab utilization at the nm production node and below continues to be strong 
additionally  the nm production ramp is well underway  and new fabs are expected to be in or entering production at that node by the end of currently  there are significant research and development efforts underway at the nm node  which is driving demand  and the first leading edge chipmakers are expected to begin production at nm by the end of based on current market trends  we believe that integrated circuit ic unit growth in will be in the high single digit to low double digit range 
we expect that chipmakers capital spending in will be down slightly from the level as they continue to work down chip inventories and attempt to match capacity expansion to market demand 
if this scenario is realized  we expect that demand for duv lithography tools in will be relatively flat to slightly down in units compared with  but that growth in demand for higher priced arf tools  and particularly for arf immersion will drive overall revenue growth in lithography 
in addition we also expect our krf and non systems revenue streams to  at a minimum  remain stable 
we therefore anticipate that revenue may grow slightly above the levels 
however  macro economic factors  such as high energy prices and interest rates  could have a negative impact on consumer spending  including spending on electronic devices 
additionally  geopolitical turmoil can create a heightened sense of uncertainty that can cause consumers to become more cautious in their spending 
either or both of these factors would have a negative effect on the demand for our products 
during the course of  we focused on better serving our customers  building a better company  and creating shareholder value 
we introduced an innovative new light source  we enhanced overall operating efficiencies  and achieved record earnings and cash generation 
in  we generated a record million in cash from operations and in the third quarter of  we used million in cash to repurchase million shares of our common stock in the open market 
we expect to continue generating substantial levels of cash from operations in and we will continue to explore opportunities for the most effective use of our cash including additional buybacks of our common stock 
critical accounting policies and estimates general the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and use judgment that may impact the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
as a part of our ongoing internal processes  we regularly evaluate our estimates and judgments associated with revenue recognition  valuation of parts used in our refurbishment manufacturing process  inventory allowances  warranty provisions  stock based compensation  income taxes  allowances for bad debts  long lived assets valuation  intangible assets valuation  and contingencies and litigation 
we base these estimates and judgments upon historical information and other facts and assumptions that we believe to be valid and or reasonable under the circumstances 
these assumptions and facts form the basis for making judgments and estimates and for determining the carrying values of our assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources 
actual results could vary from our estimates if we were to use different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that revenue recognition  valuation of parts used in our refurbishment manufacturing process  inventory allowances  warranty provisions  stock based compensation  and income taxes require more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements than do other of our accounting estimates and judgments 
revenue recognition our revenues consist of product sales  which include sales of light source systems  consumable and spare parts  upgrades  service  service contracts  training  and limited refurbishments of light source systems 
our revenues also consist of certain funded development activities performed for our customers and under government contracts and license agreements 
the sales of our light source systems generally include training and installation services 
we determined these elements qualify as one unit of accounting under emerging issues task force eitf bulletin no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables as we do not have evidence of fair value for the undelivered training and installation elements 
furthermore  we determined that the undelivered training and installation elements are perfunctory performance obligations and are not essential to the functionality of our light source systems 
therefore  in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 we recognize revenue when the revenue recognition criteria are met for the light source system  and accrue the costs of providing the training and installation services 
we recognize light source system revenue at one of following three points  depending on the terms of our arrangement with our customer shipment of the light source system  delivery of the light source system or receipt of an acceptance certificate 
for the majority of our light source system sales  the shipping terms are fob shipping point and revenue is recognized upon shipment 
for our arrangements which include fob destination shipping terms  revenue is recognized upon delivery of the light source system to our customer 
lastly  one of our arrangements includes an acceptance provision  which is satisfied by the issuance of an acceptance certificate by the customer 
for these transactions  we recognize revenue upon receipt of the acceptance certificate 
in addition  we test our light source systems in environments similar to those used by our customers prior to shipment to ensure that they meet published specifications 
revenue from consumables and spare parts sales is recognized at the point that legal title passes to the customer  which is upon shipment from our facility 
for a significant portion of our spare parts sales  our customers return the consumed assembly to us as part of the sale of the new part 
we reuse some of the material within these core assemblies  mainly metal components  for the future build of core assemblies 
as a result  our revenue consists of both cash and the value of the reusable parts received from our customers as consideration for these spare part sales 
revenue associated with our customers return of core assemblies is recognized upon receipt of the returned core assembly 
the amount of the revenue is determined based upon the fair value of the reusable parts that we expect to yield from the returned core assembly based on historical experience 
service and training revenue is recognized as the services are rendered 
on a very limited basis  we refurbish light source systems owned by our customers to their original or new condition 
revenue from refurbished light source systems is recognized when the refurbishment process has been completed and  depending upon the customer  the proper delivery or acceptance terms have been met 
for funded development contracts  funds received are accounted for on the percentage of completion method based on the relationship of costs incurred to total estimated costs 
revenues generated from these types of funded development contracts are  except as noted below  included in other revenue and are derived from cost sharing contracts between certain customers and us 
if milestones on these funded development contracts require that specific results be achieved or reported by us  revenue is not recognized until that milestone is completed 
for some of the funded development contracts that we enter into with customers and government agencies  we evaluate certain criteria to determine whether recording the funds received as revenue is appropriate 
if certain conditions are met  these funds are not recorded as revenue but rather are offset against our own internal research and development expenses in the period that the milestone is achieved 
accounting for parts used in refurbishment manufacturing process over the last several years as part of our regular business activities  we have conducted significant parts refurbishment and material reclaim activities related to some of our core assemblies  in particular our chamber assemblies 
the volume of this activity significantly increased in and we expect volumes to increase over time as our installed base of light sources continues to rise and we become more efficient in these refurbishment activities and develop capabilities to reclaim material from and refurbish other core assemblies 
these activities involve arrangements with our customers where we sell a new part to the customer at a reduced sales price if the customer returns the consumed assembly that the new part replaces 
these returned core assemblies contain a certain amount of material  primarily metal components  that may be reused by us in future core assemblies 
upon receipt of these consumed core assemblies from our customers  we record an entry to recognize the estimated fair value of the reusable components either as revenue if the return of the core assembly relates to a spare part replacement sale or as a reduction in cost of product sales if the return of the core assembly is related to a part being replaced under our warranty or per the terms of an active service contract with the customer 
the value of the reusable parts contained within the consumed assembly is determined based upon historical data on the value of the reusable parts that we typically yield from a consumed assembly 
as part of our normal excess and obsolete inventory analysis  these consumed assemblies are also reviewed on a monthly basis and an inventory allowance is recorded as appropriate for these parts 
the value that we assign to these core assemblies can be affected by the current demand for the reusable parts in our manufacturing operations and the actual yield rate achieved for parts within these consumed core assemblies 
we believe that our methodology for valuing the reusable parts within these returned core assemblies is reasonable  but any decreases in the demand for the parts or any changes in the yield of the reusable parts included in these core assemblies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in and  the amount by which the value of these core assemblies was affected by decreases in demand and changes in yield was immaterial 
inventory allowance we perform an analysis of our inventory allowances on at least a quarterly basis to determine the adequacy of this allowance on our financial statements 
the amount of the inventory allowance is determined by taking into consideration certain assumptions related to market conditions and future demands for our products  including changes to product mix  new product introductions  and or product discontinuances  which may result in excess or obsolete inventory 
we determine the level of excess and obsolete inventory associated with our raw materials and production inventory  which includes all parts on hand from our refurbishment activities  by comparing the on hand inventory balances and inventory on order to the next months of forecasted demand 
we then adjust this calculation for inventory that has a high likelihood of use beyond one year or can be used in other products that may have lower demands 
after this adjustment  we arrive at our total exposure for excess and obsolete inventory within our raw materials and production inventory 
as part of this analysis  we also determine whether there are potential amounts owed to vendors as a result of cancelled or modified raw material orders 
we estimate and record a separate liability  which is included in accrued and other liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets for such amounts owed 
the inventory allowance totaled million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the increase in the inventory allowance at december  as compared to december  was primarily due to changes in the month forecasted demand from period to period for both raw materials and consumable and spare parts  engineering change orders which impacted excess and obsolete levels and the updated assessment of on hand inventory with no requirements beyond the month forecasted demand by our senior manufacturing management 
the methodologies used to analyze excess and obsolete inventory and determine the inventory allowance are significantly affected by future demand and usage of our products 
there are many factors that could potentially affect the future demand or usage of our products  including the following overall condition of the semiconductor industry  which is highly cyclical in nature  rate at which our lithography tool manufacturers and chipmaker customers take delivery of our light source systems and our consumable and spare parts  loss of any of our three major customers or a significant change in demand from any of these three customers  overall mix of light source system models or consumable and spare parts and any changes to that mix required by our customers  utilization rates of our light sources at chipmakers  and engineering change orders 
based upon our experience  we believe that the estimates we use in calculating the inventory allowance are reasonable and properly reflect the risk of excess and obsolete inventory 
if actual demand or the usage periods for our inventory are substantially different from our estimates  adjustments to our inventory allowance may be required  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
warranty provision we maintain an accrual for the estimated cost of product warranties associated with our product sales 
warranty costs include the replacement parts and labor costs to repair our products during the warranty periods 
at the time revenue is recognized  we record a warranty provision  which is included in cost of product sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the warranty coverage period and terms for light source systems and consumable and spare parts varies by light source system model 
the warranty provision for our products is reviewed monthly and determined by using a statistical financial model  which takes into consideration actual historical expenses  product failure rates  and potential risks associated with our different products 
this model is then used to estimate future expenses related to warranty and the required warranty provision 
the risk levels and historical cost information and failure rates used within this model are reviewed throughout the year and updated as these inputs change over the product s life cycle 
due to the highly technical nature of our light source system products  the newer model light sources and the modules contained within them have higher inherent warranty risks with their initial shipments and require higher warranty provisions until the technology becomes more mature 
the total balance in the warranty provision accrual as of december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
this slight decrease is primarily due to improved warranty performance of both light source systems and consumable and spare parts resulting in lower warranty provision requirements as calculated by our financial model and updated throughout the improved warranty performance in is the result of proven extended lives of our consumable modules and an increase in the level of expertise and training of our field service engineers who perform warranty service on our light source systems and consumable and spare parts 
this improved overall warranty performance and the resulting decrease in the provision requirements was almost completely offset by the higher level of consumables and spare parts sales in as compared to and the resulting higher level of warranty provisions to support those sales 
we actively engage in product improvement programs and processes to limit our warranty costs  but our warranty obligation is affected by the complexity of our product  product failure rates and costs incurred to correct those product failures at customer sites 
the industry in which we operate is subject to rapid technological change  and as a result  we periodically introduce newer  more complex light sources 
although we classify these newly released light source models as having a higher risk in our warranty model resulting in higher warranty provisions  we are more likely to have differences between the estimated and actual warranty costs for these new products 
this is due to limited or no historical product performance data on which to base our future warranty costs 
warranty provisions for our older and more established light source models are more predictable as we have more historical information available on these products 
if actual product failure rates or estimated costs to repair those product failures were to differ from our estimates  revisions to our estimated warranty provision would be required  which could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
stock based compensation we grant options to purchase our common stock to our employees and grant stock unit awards to our non employee directors under our current stock plan 
the benefits provided under this plan are share based payments subject to the provisions of sfas no 
r 
effective january   we adopted the requirements of sfas no 
r which address the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
as a result of this new accounting requirement  our consolidated financial statements include compensation expense as calculated per the provisions of sfas no 
r 
in adopting sfas no 
r  we elected to use the modified prospective transition method  thus our consolidated financial statements for periods prior to january  do not include any impact of sfas no 
r 
we also elected to attribute the value of share based compensation to expense using the straight line method for awards granted after december  upon our adoption of sfas no 
r 
compensation expense for awards outstanding and unvested as of december  are being recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation expense calculated according to the pro forma disclosure provisions under sfas no 
which uses an accelerated expense recognition method for those awards with a graded vesting schedule 
share based compensation expense related to stock options and stock units was million before taxes for the year ended december  included in this stock based compensation expense for is million related to a small number of stock options that were granted primarily in for which we used the incorrect measurement date to calculate our compensation expense  and as a result failed to record the related compensation expense in the correct periods 
we recorded the charge in as the charge was neither material to or any prior period 
upon adoption of sfas no 
r on january   we elected to value our share based payment awards using the black scholes option pricing model  as we had under the pro forma provisions of sfas no 
the determination of fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these assumptions include the expected term of stock options and our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards 
we determine our expected volatility by using a combination of historical and implied volatility  or blended volatility  to derive our expected volatility assumption as allowed under sfas no 
r and staff accounting bulletin no 
implied volatility is based on our six month traded options on our common stock 
we determined that the volatility calculated using a blend of implied volatility and our historical volatility is more reflective of expected volatility than using only historical volatility 
the expected term of stock options represents the weighted average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding 
we determine the expected term of our stock options based on observed historical exercise patterns for our company  which we believe are indicative of future exercise behavior 
other assumptions required for estimating fair value under the black scholes option pricing model include the expected risk free interest rate and expected dividend yield of our stock 
our risk free interest rate assumption is based upon currently available rates on zero coupon us government issues for the expected term of our stock options 
the expected dividend rate is not applicable to us as we have not historically declared or paid dividends nor do we anticipate paying cash dividends in the future 
sfas no 
r also requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and we have estimated our forfeitures based on historical experience 
we will revise this estimate  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeiture rates differ from our estimates 
in our pro forma information required under sfas no 
for periods prior to january   we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
if we change any of the key assumptions that we use in the black scholes option pricing model such as expected volatility or expected term or if we decide to use a different valuation model in the future or change our forfeiture rate  the compensation expense that we record under sfas no 
r may differ significantly in the future from what we have recorded in the current period 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
pursuant to sfas no 
 a deferred tax asset or liability is generally recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences  net operating loss nol carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets are to be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized within the carryback or carryforward periods 
information about an enterprise s current financial position and its results of operations for the current and preceding years  as well as all currently available information about future years should be considered 
we have considered our industry s outlook for the future  our historical performance and estimated future taxable income  and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
using this information  we have prepared a model to forecast our expected taxable income in future years and to estimate when the benefits of our deferred tax assets are likely to be realized 
based upon the analysis  with the exceptions noted below  we believe that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize all of our deferred tax assets within the period covered by our model and  as such  no valuation allowance has been provided against these deferred tax assets 
however  a valuation allowance has been provided against certain deferred tax assets related to tcz s business and our french branch operations in the total amount of million  as these businesses have not yet developed sufficiently to allow us to assert that these assets will ultimately be realized 
at december   we had federal tax credit carryforwards of million which begin to expire in at december   we had state tax credit carryforwards of million  which may be carried forward indefinitely 
at december  we had foreign nol carryforwards of million which may be carried forward indefinitely 
a material adverse change in the outlook for worldwide lithography tool sales  the expected selling prices or profit margins for our products or our expected share of the global market for lithography light sources  could cause us to determine that additional valuation allowances are needed for some or all of our deferred tax assets  and would result in an increase to our income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made 
our accounting for income taxes give effect to the phase out of the extraterritorial income exclusion eti benefit in and  and its concurrent replacement with a phased in manufacturing activity deduction under internal revenue code section it is our intention to reinvest undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and thereby indefinitely postpone their remittance  with the exception of our tcz joint venture 
accordingly  we have not provided us federal income and foreign withholding taxes on million of undistributed earnings from non us operations as of december  it is not practicable to estimate the amount of the deferred tax liability on such unremitted earnings 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items in our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated years ended december  revenues product sales product sales related party other total revenues cost and expenses cost of product sales research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total costs and expenses operating income other income expense net income before income tax provision and minority interest income tax provision minority interest net income gross margin on product sales years ended december  and revenues 
the types of revenue that we generate and how we recognize revenue for each is explained above under the heading critical accounting policies and estimates 
the following table summarizes the components of our revenue in thousands  except units sold years ended december  light source systems revenue units sold average selling price consumable and spare parts and service products other revenue total revenue calculation of average selling price includes million deferred light source revenue during and excludes million deferred light source revenue that was recognized in we had one arrangement where a portion of the light source system fee was not payable until the system was installed successfully at the end user 
this arrangement expired in march product sales increased from million for to million for the increase in product sales was due to higher light source system revenues and continued growth in consumable and spare parts and service product revenues for compared to light source system revenues increased from million for to million for a total of light source systems were sold in at an average selling price of  compared to light source systems sold in at an average selling price of million 
on a foreign currency adjusted basis  the average selling price for was  compared to million for the slight increase in the average selling price year over year reflects a shift in the product mix from capacity driven lower priced krf products in to higher priced technology buys of advanced arf products in the increase in quantities of light source systems sold from to reflects the slight slowdown of the industry in the beginning of compared to the upturn in the semiconductor industry in chipmakers expanded capacity needs have impacted the demand for our light source systems  which  combined with our growing installed base of light source systems  has increased the demand for our consumables and spare parts and service products 
this growth in consumable and spare parts demand and rising tool utilization resulted in an increase in consumables and spare parts and service revenues of from million for to million for consumable and spare parts and service products revenue was also favorably impacted by the revenue recorded under a laser replacement agreement we entered into in revenues from funded development contracts were million for compared to  for there were no revenues recorded or earned associated with the tcz joint venture for we expect that our first quarter revenue will be flat or increase slightly from the fourth quarter levels 
our backlog at december  was million compared to million at december  bookings for the year ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
the book to bill ratio for the quarter ended december  was compared to for the quarter ended december  the increase in the backlog is due to the changing condition of the semiconductor industry from to and the increase in our average selling prices from year to year due to the continued adoption of our advanced arf products 
the backlog as of december  reflected the brief slowdown and flattening in the semiconductor industry that started in late and continued into  whereas the backlog as of december  reflects the recent growth phase and upturn in the semiconductor industry 
the increase in bookings year over year was primarily due to increased orders of light source systems and consumables and spare parts in as a result of the upturn in the semiconductor industry in we installed light sources at chipmakers and other end users during compared to light sources installed during sales to our three lithography tool manufacturing customers  asml  canon  and nikon  amounted to  and  respectively  of total revenue for  and  and  respectively  of total revenue for our sales are generated primarily by shipments to customers in europe  japan  korea  taiwan  and the us approximately of our sales for both and were derived from customers outside the us we maintain a wholly owned japanese subsidiary  cymer japan  which sells to our japanese customers 
revenues from japanese customers  generated primarily by cymer japan  accounted for and of total revenues for and  respectively 
the activities of cymer japan are limited to sales and service of products purchased by cymer japan from us as the parent corporation 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our sales 
cost of product sales 
cost of product sales includes direct material and labor  warranty expenses  license fees  manufacturing and service overhead  and foreign exchange gains and losses on foreign currency forward exchange contracts forward contracts associated with purchases of our products by cymer japan for resale under firm third party sales commitments 
shipping costs associated with our product sales are also included in cost of product sales 
we do not charge our customers for shipping fees 
the cost of product sales increased from million for to million for this increase in the cost of product sales was primarily due to higher light source system sales and sales of consumables and spare parts and service products in compared to this increase in cost of product sales was partially offset by a decrease in warranty costs year over year 
this decrease in warranty costs in is primarily due to the proven extended lives of our consumable modules and efficiencies gained through an increase in the level of expertise and training of our field service engineers who perform warranty service on our light source systems and consumable and spare parts 
gross profit increased from million for to million for the gross margin on product sales was for compared to for this higher gross margin in as compared to was primarily due to operating efficiency improvements  cost reductions  reduced lead and cycle times and reduced warranty costs which resulted from product reliability improvements which were made throughout the higher gross margin year over year was also caused by the overall increase in product sales in and the mix of those product sales being higher margin products 
going forward  we anticipate that gross margin will remain strong but stay at the current level in the high range 
research and development 
research and development expenses include costs of internally funded and externally funded projects as well as continuing product development support expenses  which consist primarily of employee and material costs  depreciation of equipment and other engineering related costs 
our research and development expenses are offset by amounts associated with certain of our externally funded research and development contracts 
research and development expenses increased from million for to million for due primarily to costs associated with our ltps product development efforts  euv light source development efforts and arf product development efforts for the design of an enhanced universal platform for our xl series light sources  and associated derivative products based on this platform 
research and development expenses were offset by amounts related to our externally funded research and development contracts of million and  for and  respectively 
in addition to our development of euv and ltps technologies  we also continued to focus on next generation arf and krf products 
as a percentage of total revenues  research and development expenses decreased percentage points from for to for due primarily to revenues increasing at a faster rate than research and development expenses in as compared to as a result of our decision to enter the flat panel display manufacturing tools market with the formation of the tcz joint venture  our research and development expenses going forward will also include a greater focus on ltps product development efforts 
we expect that our investment in research and development expenses overall will continue and that our research and development expenses associated with tcz will remain relatively flat in compared to the levels 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses include sales  marketing and customer support staff expenses and other marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased from million for to million for the sales and marketing expenses increase primarily reflects million in profit sharing and bonuses due to our improved financial performance and million of stock based compensation expense associated with the sfas no 
r requirements which we adopted in january in addition  sales and marketing expenses were higher in compared to as a result of expenses associated with our tcz joint venture which was formed in july as a percentage of total revenues  such sales and marketing expenses decreased from for to for we anticipate that sales and marketing expenses may remain relatively flat in the first quarter of general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of management and administrative personnel costs  professional services  including external audit fees  and administrative operating costs 
general and administrative expenses increased from million for to million for the increase is primarily due to a million increase in stock based compensation expense recorded in as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
r on january  in addition to stock based compensation expense recorded as a result of sfas no 
r  we recorded million of stock based compensation expense in the fourth quarter of related to a small number of stock options granted primarily in this additional stock based compensation expense resulted from us using the incorrect measurement date to calculate our compensation expense for those stock options 
additional increases in general and administrative expenses from to include million in profit sharing and bonus expenses and a million increase in external audit and advisory fees 
in addition  general and administrative expenses in reflect increased expenses associated with the tcz joint venture formed in july as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses increased from for to for we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will decrease in the first quarter of compared to the fourth quarter levels as a result of recording the million in stock based compensation expense related to the stock options in the fourth quarter of total other income net 
net other income consists primarily of interest income and expense  foreign currency exchange gains and losses associated with fluctuations in the value of the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries against the us dollar  and gains and losses associated with debt extinguishment transactions 
net other income was million and million for and  respectively 
this significant increase in net other income from year to year was primarily due to a significant increase in interest income  the receipt of million in life insurance proceeds following the death of one of our executive officers in the first quarter of  a decrease in interest expense and a foreign currency exchange gain recorded in as compared to a foreign currency exchange loss recorded in the increase in interest income reflects higher market interest rate yields on larger cash and investment balances which resulted from higher earnings and significant proceeds from stock option and warrant exercises during the decrease in interest expense from year to year was due to our lower debt balances as a result of the repurchase of our convertible subordinated notes that we made in the second quarter of other income was positively impacted in by a million gain on debt extinguishment which resulted from the repurchase of these convertible subordinated notes 
foreign currency exchange losses totaled million  interest income and other income totaled million  interest expense totaled million and gain on debt extinguishment totaled million for  compared to a foreign currency exchange gain of million  interest and other income of million  and interest expense of million for income tax provision 
the tax provision of  and million for and  respectively  reflects an annual effective rate of and  respectively

years ended december  and revenues 
product sales decreased from million for to million for this decrease in product sales was due to lower light source system revenues partially offset by higher consumable and spare parts and service product revenues during as compared to light source system revenues decreased from million for to million for a total of light source systems were sold in at an average selling price of  compared to systems sold in at an average selling price of  on a foreign currency adjusted basis  the average selling price for was  compared to  for the increase in the average selling price from year to year reflected the shift in the product mix from capacity driven lower priced krf products in to higher priced technology buys of advanced arf products in the decrease in quantities of light source systems sold from year to year was due to the brief upturn in the semiconductor industry in  when chipmakers expanded capacity  compared to the slight slowdown and flattening of the industry in which impacted the demand for our light source systems  particularly krf light sources for capacity expansion 
this decrease in light source system revenues from year to year was partially offset by a increase in revenues associated with our consumable and spare parts and service products from million for to million for revenues from funded development contracts were  for  compared to million for there were no revenues recorded or earned associated with the tcz joint venture for sales to our three lithography tool manufacturing customers  asml  canon  and nikon  amounted to  and  respectively  of total revenue for  and  and  respectively  of total revenue for approximately and of our sales for and  respectively  were derived from customers outside the us revenues from japanese customers  generated primarily by cymer japan  accounted for and of total revenues for and  respectively 
cost of product sales 
the cost of product sales decreased from million for to million for this decrease in the cost of product sales was primarily due to lower light source system sales in compared to in addition  the decrease in the cost of product sales from year to year also reflects lower overall product costs as a result of our material costs reduction efforts 
gross profit decreased from million for to million for the gross margin on product sales was for as compared to for this lower gross margin from year to year was primarily due to the increase in consumables and service revenues which have lower gross margins 
in addition  the gross margin for was favorably impacted by approximately two percentage points due to a customs refund that was received by our korea office and credited to cost of product sales 
gross margin in the second half of was improved from the first half of the year due to increased factory yield and utilization and decreased cycle times and overall material costs 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased from million for to million for due primarily to costs associated with our ltps product development efforts and euv light source development 
research and development expenses were offset by amounts related to our externally funded research and development contracts of million and million for and  respectively 
in addition to our development of euv and ltps technologies during  we also continued to focus on next generation arf products based on the xl platform and next generation krf products 
as a percentage of total revenues  research and development expenses increased from for to for due primarily to increased research and development efforts and lower revenues in as compared to sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased from million for to million for this increase in sales and marketing expenses from year to year primarily reflects increased sales expenses associated with our chipmaker customers at our foreign locations and market development costs associated with the tcz joint venture 
these expenses were offset by decreased profit sharing and bonus expenses incurred in compared to as a percentage of total revenues  such sales and marketing expenses increased from for to for general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased from million for to million for primarily due to the receipt of rent payments in from the tenants in two of our san diego facilities  which we subleased in the third and fourth quarters of general and administrative expenses in also included million in costs associated with revisions of our estimates related to the timing and market rates for subleasing the san diego and charlestown facilities  which we exited in compared to  of such expenses recorded in the lower general and administrative expenses in were offset by increased stock based compensation expense associated with non employees and initial expenses associated with the tcz joint venture during the year 
as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased slightly from for to for total other income expense net 
net other expense totaled  for  compared to net other income of million for the change from net other expense to net other income was primarily due to an increase in interest income  a decrease in interest expense and a higher gain on debt extinguishment related to our notes repurchase activities from year to year 
this was offset by a foreign currency exchange loss recorded in compared to a small foreign currency gain recorded in the increase in interest income from to reflected higher market interest rates for our short term and long term investments on higher cash and investment balances 
the decrease in interest expense from year to year was due to our lower debt balances as a result of the repurchase of our convertible subordinated notes that we made in the third quarter of and the second quarter of foreign currency exchange gains totaled  interest income totaled million  interest expense totaled million and gain on debt extinguishment totaled  for  compared to a foreign currency exchange loss of million  interest income of million  interest expense of million and gain on debt extinguishment totaling million for income tax provision 
the tax provision of million and  for and  respectively  reflects an annual effective rate of and less than  respectively 
the change in the annual effective tax rate from period to period was primarily attributable to the decrease in pre tax earnings as well as tax benefits from us export incentive programs and research credits 
the annual effective tax rates for both periods were less than the us statutory rate of primarily as a result of permanent book tax differences and tax credits 
the effective tax rate is a function of current tax law and geographic location of pre tax income 
during the fourth quarter of  the expiration of certain statutes of limitations related primarily to us federal tax credits and deductions allowed us to release tax reserves in the amount of million 
as a result  our fourth quarter of annualized effective tax rate was a benefit rate of resulting in an annual effective tax rate of less than 
the decision to release tax reserves is made each quarter based on all relevant facts and circumstances 
the eti was repealed by the american jobs creation act of subject to certain transition rules 
the eti exclusion is being replaced with a manufacturing activity deduction under irc section with a phase out of eti benefits in and our estimated eti benefit for reflects the transition rules 
we did not benefit from the section deduction in due to the taxable income limitation 
the benefit is available to us for future tax years subject to certain transition rules 
we anticipate that the benefit available to us under both regimes will be comparable for years in which we have taxable income 
liquidity and capital resources historically we have funded our operations primarily from cash generated from operations  the proceeds of the note offerings  bank borrowings  and the proceeds from employee stock option exercises 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  million in short term investments  million in long term investments  and million in working capital 
in february  we issued million in aggregate principal amount in a private placement of notes 
these notes are due on february  with interest payable semi annually on february and august of each year at per annum 
the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount or an effective conversion price of per share 
we used a portion of the net proceeds from this private placement to redeem the previously issued notes that were then outstanding 
the remaining proceeds are being used for our operating  investing and financing activities 
with the approval of our board of directors  we have periodically repurchased these notes in the open market 
we repurchased million and million principal amount of these notes in and  respectively 
as of december   there were million principal amount of notes outstanding 
net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million  million and million for  and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities during reflects net income for the year and increases in accrued and other liabilities and income taxes offset by increases in accounts receivable  inventories  and accounts payable 
the increase in accounts receivable was significant for and resulted from a higher number of product shipments than normal taking place in the last month of the year 
the increase in inventories was primarily due to our response to the growing light source utilizations and higher spares inventories to support what we thought would be a continued upturn in the semiconductor industry 
when the industry started to slow down in the later half of  we took action to reduce our spares and consumables inventory 
as a result of these actions  our inventory decreased by million in the fourth quarter of net cash provided by operating activities during reflects net income for the year  significant decreases in accounts receivable and inventory and increases in accounts payable 
the decrease in accounts receivable primarily reflects collections made in our receivable balances that were outstanding at december  and a decrease in sales compared to the decrease in inventory reflects the reduction in our field and factory inventory as a result of our ongoing initiative during to improve asset management by reducing inventory and increasing inventory turns 
net cash provided by operating activities during reflects significant net income for the year and increases in accrued expenses and other liabilities offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories 
the increase in accounts receivable is the result of higher revenues recorded during as compared to the increase in inventory balances for is primarily the result of an increased demand for spares and consumable parts to support our growing installed base of light source systems  particularly our more advanced xla series systems and the increase in sales of our light source systems 
in addition  cash from operations was negatively impacted in as a result of classifying excess tax benefits from stock option exercises in the amount of million in financing activities in rather than operating activities in accordance with sfas no 
r which was adopted on january  net cash provided by investing activities was approximately  and million for and  respectively  compared to million in cash used in investing activities in net cash provided by investing activities during reflects the timing of short term and long term investments that matured and were reinvested during the year  the acquisition of million of property and equipment  a million payment to acquire certain patents and a million payment to acquire an additional minority interest in our cymer korea subsidiary 
net cash provided by investing activities during reflects the timing of short term and long term investments that matured and were reinvested during the period  the acquisition of million of property and equipment and a million payment to acquire certain patents 
net cash used in investing activities for was due primarily to the timing of short term and long term investments that matured and were reinvested during the period  a million payment to acquire the final minority interest in our cymer korea subsidiary  a million payment to acquire certain patent license rights and the acquisition of million of property and equipment 
net cash used in financing activities was approximately million and million for and  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million in in  net cash used in financing activities reflects the repurchase of million in principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes in the third quarter of  at a discount to par 
this was offset by proceeds received from the exercise of stock options in totaling million 
net cash used in financing activities for reflects the repurchase of treasury stock of million and the purchase of approximately million principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes  at a discount to par  during the treasury stock and note purchases were offset partially by proceeds received from the exercise of employee stock options totaling million and the minority interest investment received from zeiss in the tcz joint venture of million during net cash provided by financing activities for primarily reflects the proceeds received from the exercise of employee stock options as well as the exercise of warrants and proceeds from the employee stock purchase plan totaling million 
in addition  cash from financing activities in was positively affected by the excess tax benefits for the period from stock option exercises which totaled million 
this cash provided by financing activities was offset by the repurchase of treasury stock totaling million during we require substantial working capital to fund our business  particularly to finance inventories  including purchase orders with our vendors  accounts receivable  and for capital expenditures 
our future capital requirements depend on many factors  including our manufacturing activity  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts  expansion of sales and marketing and field service and support  competitive labor market compensation requirements  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  and the market acceptance of our products 
we believe that cash generated from operations along with the liquidity provided by our existing cash balances and short term investments will be sufficient to sustain operations and provide for any potential future expansion of our business for at least the next months

recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued financial accounting standard interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum probability threshold that a tax position must meet before a financial statement benefit is recognized 
the minimum threshold is defined in fin as a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than fifty percent chance of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
fin must be applied to all existing tax positions upon initial adoption 
the cumulative effect of applying fin at adoption  if any  is to be reported as an adjustment to opening retained earnings for the year of adoption 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we have adopted a fin implementation strategy 
this strategy is aimed at identifying  evaluating and measuring all of our uncertain tax positions 
this will be done for all open tax years  by units of account and for all of our legal entities 
we are currently in the process of identifying and evaluating uncertain tax positions for all of our legal entities according to their units of account 
once this stage is completed  we will begin the measurement stage and determine the cumulative effect adjustment  if any 
since we are still in the process of implementing fin  we are not currently in a position where we can quantify or disclose the potential effect of fin on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value using generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures related to fair value measurements 
this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  sfas no 
does not require any new fair value measurements 
however  for some entities  the application of this statement will change current practice 
this statement is effective for us on january  we are currently evaluating the impact of this pronouncement on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  fasb issued sfas no 
sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r 
we adopted all provisions of sfas no 
in december except for the provision which will require us to measure the funded status of our pension plans as of the date of our year end statement of financial position 
this provision will be effective for us for the fiscal year ending december   and we do not expect its adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
see note under accounting pronouncements adopted and note under retirement plans to our consolidated financial statements for information on the provisions of sfas no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we conduct business in several international currencies through our global operations 
due to the large volume of our business that we conduct in japan  the japanese operation poses our greatest foreign currency risk 
we use financial instruments  principally forward contracts  to manage our foreign currency exposures 
we enter into forward contracts in order to reduce the impact of currency fluctuations related to purchases of our inventories by cymer japan in us dollars for resale under firm third party sales commitments denominated in japanese yen  as well as other foreign currency exposures including exposures related to intercompany debt 
we do not enter into forward contracts for speculative purposes 
as of december   we had outstanding forward contracts to buy us million for billion yen under foreign currency exchange facilities with contract rates ranging from yen to yen per us dollar 
these contracts expire on various dates through december our forward contracts generally qualify for hedge accounting treatment per the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
as a result  we defer changes in the fair value for the effective portion of these hedges and record the amount in other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassify the gain or loss to cost of product sales in the same period that the related sale is made to the third party 
the fair value of all of our forward contracts and the deferred gain net of tax for those that qualify for hedge accounting treatment totaled  and  respectively  as of december  the fair value of these forward contracts as of december  would have fluctuated by million if the foreign currency exchange rate for the japanese yen to the us dollar on these forward contracts had changed by 
investment and debt risk we maintain an investment portfolio consisting primarily of government and corporate fixed income securities  certificates of deposit and commercial paper 
while it is our general intent to hold such securities until maturity  we will occasionally sell certain securities for cash flow purposes 
therefore  our investments are classified as available for sale and are carried on the balance sheet at fair value 
a change in market interest rates of would have impacted our net income from these investments by approximately million in in february  we issued million principal amount of unsecured fixed rate convertible subordinated notes due february  interest on these notes is payable on february and august of each year 
the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount subject to adjustment under certain conditions 
we may redeem the notes after february  at certain redemption prices expressed as a percentage of the principal amount 
the notes are subordinated to our existing and future senior indebtedness and effectively subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries 
because the interest rate is fixed  we believe there is no risk of increased interest expense 
these notes are recorded at face value on the consolidated balance sheets 
in the third quarter of and the second quarter of  we repurchased  at a discount to par  million and million principal amount  respectively  of these notes 
as of december  and  million principal amount of the notes were outstanding 
the fair value of such debt based on quoted market prices on december  and was million and million  respectively
