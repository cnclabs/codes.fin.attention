item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation unless specifically noted  the following discussion and analysis provides information on awr s consolidated operations and assets 
for the years ended december   and  there is generally no material difference between the consolidated operations and assets of awr and the operations and assets of gswc 
however  where necessary  the following discussion and analysis includes references specifically to awr s other subsidiaries ccwc and asus and its subsidiaries 
overview registrant s revenues  income  and cash flows are earned primarily through delivering potable water to homes and businesses 
rates charged to customers of gswc and ccwc are determined by the cpuc and acc  respectively 
these rates are intended to allow recovery of operating costs and a fair rate of return on capital 
factors recently affecting our financial performance include the process and timing of setting rates charged to customers  our ability to recover  and the process for recovering  the costs of water and electricity in rates  weather  the impact on the cost of operations and expenditures of capital to improve and protect water quality  pressures on water supply caused by population growth  more stringent water quality standards  and watershed and aquifer pollution and contamination from external sources  capital expenditures needed to replace and upgrade water systems infrastructure  and increased costs and risks associated with litigation relating to water quality and water supply  including suits involved by registrant to protect its water supply 
for  net income was million compared to million in  a decrease of 
diluted earnings per share for were compared to in  a decrease of 
two principal factors contributed to the decrease in net income first  there was the favorable cpuc decision on july  regarding the aerojet matter which added about million to net income in july or approximately per share with no similar gain in  and second  due to decreasing energy prices  the pretax unrealized loss on purchased power contracts of million decreased net income by per share during in contrast to a pretax unrealized gain of million which increased net income by per share for the same period of offsetting these decreases was another favorable decision issued by the cpuc in april regarding gswc s water rights lease revenues received from the city of folsom which increased net income by million or approximately per share  and increased water rates approved by the cpuc and acc  which contributed approximately million to revenues or per share 
higher operating expenses in also impacted earnings as described herein 
registrant plans to continue to seek additional rate increases in future years to recover operating and supply costs and receive fair returns on invested capital 
capital expenditures in future years are expected to remain at much higher levels than depreciation expense 
cash solely from operations is not expected to be sufficient to fund registrant s needs for capital expenditures  dividends  investments in the contract business and other cash needs 
registrant expects to fund these needs through a combination of debt and common share offerings throughout the next five years

gswc was authorized to collect the balance of the aerojet litigation memorandum account of approximately million  through a rate surcharge  which will continue for no longer than years 
as a result of this decision  in july gswc recorded an increase of approximately million to the aerojet regulatory asset to include previously expensed carrying and other costs  and recorded a corresponding pre tax gain 
in addition  gswc was ordered to restore to the appropriate plant accounts  those amounts that have been reimbursed by aerojet pursuant to the settlement 
this resulted in gswc recording an approximate million decrease to depreciation expense during the third quarter of there were no similar entries during the year ended december  the following is a summary of the impact on the results of operations for the year ended december  resulting from this decision amount operating expenses increase decrease power purchased for resale other operating expenses administrative and general expenses depreciation and amortization total pre tax impact to operating expenses interest interest expense interest income total net interest charges total pre tax impact to results of operations impact to taxes on income total impact to net income impact to basic earnings per share impact to diluted earnings per share there was an unrealized loss on purchased power contracts in due to decreasing energy prices versus an unrealized gain on purchased power contracts in the cumulative unrealized loss on purchased power contracts decreased pretax income by approximately million  or per share  for the year ended december   as compared to a cumulative unrealized gain on purchased power contracts that increased pretax income by million  or per share increase to income  for the same period in eliminating the effects of the two items discussed above  basic and diluted earnings per share for would have increased by per share as compared to  resulting primarily from the followings a decision issued by the cpuc on april  regarding the treatment of gswc s water rights lease revenues added about million to pretax income for the year ended december  or approximately per share 
in this decision  the cpuc authorized gswc to reinvest all lease revenues since january  inclusive of the balances in the regulatory liability accounts established by gswc for this matter  in water system infrastructure 
these investments will be included in the rate base upon which gswc earns a rate of return 
in accordance with california law  gswc will have years in which to reinvest the proceeds 
as a result  gswc transferred about million of water rights lease revenues received from the city of folsom in and from the regulatory liability account into other operating revenues 
gswc also recorded pretax income of million reflecting water rights lease revenues for the year ended december  water rate increases contributed approximately million to revenues  or per share for the year ended december  this was partially offset by higher expenses as described below 
an increase in asus s pretax operating income of million  or per share  as compared to the same period of by operating and maintaining the water and wastewater systems for the us government 
the increases included revenue recognized for certain special projects and reimbursement of various operating costs incurred during the period of transition of the operation and maintenance of the water and wastewater systems at military bases in maryland and virginia formerly owned and operated by the us government 
a million increase in other interest income  excluding the impact of the aerojet decision in july mentioned above  or per share  resulting from interest accrued on the uncollected balance of the aerojet litigation memorandum account authorized by the cpuc and interest income related to a million internal revenue service refund received in may a lower effective tax rate increased earnings by per share resulting primarily from i a  tax benefit relating to a million irs refund received in may  and ii differences between book and taxable income  which are treated as flow through adjustments in accordance with regulatory requirements 
higher operating expenses as described below 
operating revenues for the year ended december   revenues from water operations increased by to million  compared to million for the year ended december  higher water revenues reflect rate increases since covering almost all water customers  which contributed million in increased revenues 
in addition  an increase of about in billed water consumption resulting from changes in weather conditions between the two periods  also increased revenues by approximately million 
differences in temperature and rainfall in registrant s service areas impact sales of water to customers  causing fluctuations in registrant s revenues and earnings between comparable periods 
for the year ended december   revenues from electric operations increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase reflects primarily a increase in kilowatt hour kwh usage  due to changes in weather conditions which caused the usage of snow making machines to increase in the cooler winter weather as compared to the same period last year allowed the ski resorts industrial customers to remain open well into may  operating their lifts and some snow making in the evening hours 
new rates authorized by the cpuc for the investment in a megawatt mw natural gas fueled generation facility also contributed to the increase 
the new rates went into effect on april  and have generated approximately million in additional annual revenues  subject to refund pending the cpuc s final cost review 
the new bear valley electric rates have been recognized in and revenues and management believes it is probable that the final cpuc cost review will not result in refunds to the customer 
registrant relies upon rate approvals by state regulatory agencies in california and arizona in order to recover operating expenses and provide for a fair return on invested and borrowed capital used to fund utility plant 
without adequate rate relief granted in a timely manner  revenues and earnings can be negatively impacted 
for the year ended december   other operating revenues increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due primarily to an increase at asus of million related to construction revenues with the us government based on the percentage of completion for the construction of certain improvements  renewal and replacements to the existing water and wastewater infrastructures at fort bliss and at the new military bases located in virginia and maryland pursuant to new military contracts entered into in early certain of the construction projects in were firm fixed price contracts and supplemental to asus s year contracts with the us government 
there were also additional revenues totaling million generated from operating and maintaining the water and wastewater systems under the new military contracts in virginia and maryland 
furthermore  there was an increase of million at gswc due to a decision issued by the cpuc on april  enabling gswc to record million  or  of water rights lease revenues from the city of folsom from january to december prior to this decision  the apportionment of any lease revenues that gswc collected in and  totaling million  had been included in a regulatory liability account and no amounts were recognized as revenues until regulatory uncertainties about this matter were resolved 
registrant also recorded additional revenue of million  reflecting the annual water rights lease revenues 
operating expenses for the year ended december   purchased water costs decreased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease is due primarily to a change in the supply mix caused by less purchased water needed to replace groundwater supply lost in due to wells being removed from service 
the wells were removed from service in as a result of water quality issues and mechanical problems  particularly in gswc s foothill district 
the cost of purchased water in this district decreased by approximately million as a result of the wells being returned to operation in this decrease was partially offset by an increase in customer demand resulting from higher consumption and increased water rates by imported water suppliers 
for the year ended december   of registrant s supply mix was purchased water as compared to purchased water for the year ended december  for the year ended december   the cost of power purchased for pumping increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due to an increase in kwh usage by registrant caused by higher customer water demand and an increase in pumping volume due to the supply mix change discussed above 
for the year ended december   groundwater production assessments increased by to million as compared to million for the year ended december  due to increases in well production to meet higher customer demand 
there were also increases in assessment rates levied against groundwater production  effective july and average pump tax rates increased in regions ii and iii in july by approximately and  respectively  and and in july  respectively 
registrant has established supply cost memorandum accounts for increases in costs due to changes in rates by suppliers providing our purchased water  purchased power and groundwater related pump taxes for our water service areas in california 
registrant believes that these higher costs will be recovered through water rates 
however  changes in the water resource mix between water supplied from purchased sources and that supplied from registrant s own wells can increase decrease actual supply related costs relative to that approved for recovery through rates  thereby impacting earnings either negatively or positively 
for the year ended december   cost of power purchased for resale to customers in gswc s bear valley electric division increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december   primarily reflecting higher customer demand during the year ended december  in addition  in november of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc ordered mirant americas energy marketing mirant marketing to reimburse  of the amount gswc had refunded to mirant marketing in previous years 
gswc received and recorded the reimbursement of  plus interest  from mirant marketing in may of gswc recorded the mirant marketing reimbursement in its supply cost balancing account which also resulted in no net impact on earnings in unrealized loss gain on purchased power contracts represents losses and gains recorded for gswc s purchased power agreements with pinnacle west capital corporation pwcc  which qualified as derivative instruments 
the million pretax unrealized loss on purchased power contracts for the year ended december  is due to a decrease in the current forward market prices since december  there was a million pretax unrealized gain on purchased power contracts for the year ended december  unrealized gains and losses at bear valley electric will continue to impact earnings during the life of the contract with pwcc  which terminates in as a result  gswc has recognized these contracts at fair market value on its balance sheets resulting in a cumulative unrealized loss of million as of december  gains or losses on these contracts will be recognized upon termination of the contracts 
for the year ended december   the provision for supply cost balancing accounts increased by million as compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the approval by the cpuc and recording in june and october of million under collections related to region iii s supply cost memorandum accounts  which reduced the expense 
we began recording under and over collections on a monthly basis for pursuant to a cpuc decision issued in this increase as compared to was partially offset by a million net decrease in the provision for water supply cost balancing accounts due to an increase in under collections in there was also a net decrease of  in the electric supply cost balancing account due to an increase in net under collections of  for  and a refund payment of  received in from mirant marketing for purchased energy cost 
for the year ended december   other operating expenses increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due primarily to higher operating expenses of million at odus and tus due to the commencement of operation of the water and wastewater systems at military bases in maryland and virginia in early these increases were partially offset by a decrease in other operating expenses at fbws of  due primarily to an increase in reimbursements from the us government and contractors  for operating expenses incurred at fort bliss 
there was also a net increase of million at gswc primarily due to i a  downward adjustment in july of reflecting the approval from the cpuc of previously incurred operating expenses in the aerojet matter  previously discussed  ii higher chemicals and water treatment costs of  iii an increase of  in bad debt expense relating to miscellaneous accounts receivable balances  and iv approximately  of higher other operating material and service expenses 
for the year ended december   administrative and general expenses increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  caused primarily by higher administrative and general expenses of  at odus and tus due to the commencement of operation of the water and wastewater systems at military bases in maryland and virginia in early this increase at odus and tus is net of the recovery of transition period operating expenses of about  at these military bases 
other changes at asus include a decrease of  due to i an increase of  in reimbursements by the us government of indirect costs incurred by fbws  and ii lower outside services and other expenses at asus totaling  administrative and general expenses also increased by million at gswc primarily due to increases in i pensions and benefits of  caused by actuarial assumption changes in the mortality tables  ii stock based compensation expense of  due to the adoption of sfas no 
r effective january   iii labor cost increases of  due to higher wages  and iv various other benefits  office  supplies  maintenance and rent expenses of  for the year ended december   depreciation and amortization expense increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  reflecting  among other things  the effects of closing approximately million of additions to utility plant during  depreciation on which began in january in addition  there was a decrease in depreciation expense in resulting from the favorable cpuc decision on the aerojet matter  discussed previously  which ordered gswc to restore approximately million to the appropriate plant accounts and decrease depreciation expense in july of there was no such adjustment in finally  there was an increase in ccwc s depreciation expense of  as a result of new rates approved by the acc that went into effect october  registrant anticipates that depreciation expense will continue to increase due to registrant s on going construction program at its regulated subsidiaries 
registrant believes that depreciation expense related to property additions approved by the appropriate regulatory agency will be recovered through water and electric rates 
for the year ended december   maintenance expense increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due principally to an increase in required maintenance on gswc s wells and water supply sources in all regions 
there were also increases in well treatment and emergency repair costs 
furthermore  there was an increase in maintenance expense of i  at gswc s electric division due to the new mw natural gas fueled generation facility  and ii  at odus and tus due to the commencement of the operations of the water and wastewater systems pursuant to new military contracts in maryland and virginia 
for the year ended december   property and other taxes increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  reflecting additional property taxes resulting from higher assessed values  and increases in payroll taxes based on increased labor costs 
for the year ended december   asus construction expenses increased to million compared to million for the year ended december  reflecting the costs incurred for the construction of various improvements  renewals and replacements to the existing water and wastewater infrastructures at fort bliss and at the military bases located in virginia and maryland pursuant to new military contracts entered into in early the increase resulted from amendments to the original year contracts with the us government which required the construction of additional improvements at the various military bases 
for the year ended december   registrant recorded a net pretax gain of  on the sale of non utility property 
there was no similar gain in the same period of for the year ended december   registrant also recorded a net pre tax gain of  on a settlement reached with the fountain hills sanitary district fhsd in february for the capping of two ccwc wells in order to facilitate fhsd s ability to secure certain permits 
pursuant to the settlement agreement  ccwc agreed to permanently remove from service and cap one of its wells  and cap another well which had never been used as a potable source of supply 
there was no similar gain in the same period of interest expense for the year ended december   interest expense increased million as compared to the same period in reflecting primarily the approval from the cpuc in for the recovery of previously incurred and expensed interest costs totaling million in the aerojet memorandum account  discussed previously 
in addition  the increase also reflects increases in long term debt interest expense of million primarily due to the placement of million of notes in october coupled with increases in short term bank loan interest rates 
partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in short term cash borrowings 
average bank loan balances outstanding under an awr credit facility for the year ended december  were approximately million  as compared to an average of million during the same period of interest income for the year ended december   interest income increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due primarily to i interest of million accrued on the uncollected balance of the aerojet litigation memorandum account authorized by the cpuc  ii interest income of  related to a million internal revenue service irs refund received in may  and iii interest earned on short term cash surplus 
these increases were partially offset by the recognition in july of approximately  in interest income earned on the million aerojet long term note receivable 
the recording of the interest income had been deferred pending the final cpuc decision on the aerojet matter 
registrant has since been recording the interest income on the million aerojet long term note receivable on a monthly basis 
other for the year ended december   registrant recorded other income of  as a result of its ownership interest in a non operating equity investment 
income tax expense for the year ended december   income tax expense decreased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due  in part  to a decrease in pretax income of 
in addition  the decrease was as a result of flow through adjustments and a refund claim  as discussed further  below 
the effective tax rate etr for the year ended december  decreased by approximately percentage points to as compared to a etr applicable to the year ended december  the variance between the etr and the statutory tax rate is primarily the result of differences between book and taxable income that are treated as flow through adjustments in accordance with regulatory requirements 
flow through adjustments increase or decrease tax expense in one period  with an offsetting increase or decrease occurring in another period 
during the second quarter of  the recognition of the federal effect of state taxes was adjusted to conform to the flow through method reflected in the tax calculation for ratemaking purposes  which partially defers the recognition of the effect to the subsequent tax year 
this reduced income tax expense by  for the year ended december  during the third quarter of  awr filed an amended tax return for with the irs which was subject to irs and congressional joint committee of taxation jct review 
during the second quarter of  the irs and jct reviews were completed and awr received a refund in the amount of its original claim of million  with interest 
consequently  in the second quarter of  awr recorded a tax benefit of  of which  was attributable to gswc 
the effect of the difference between the cash received and this tax benefit is reflected between the current and deferred tax provisions  which did not impact net tax expense 
the refund claim benefit contributed to of the percentage point etr reduction referred to  above

net income net income for the year ended december  increased to million  equivalent to and per common share  respectively  on a basic and fully diluted basis  compared to million or and per share  respectively  for the year ended december  impacting the comparability in the results of the two periods are the following significant items as discussed in the results  the recorded results reflects a favorable decision issued by the cpuc on july  regarding the aerojet matter which added about million to net income in july of or approximately per share 
the impact to pretax income resulted in reduced interest charges  depreciation expense and other operating expenses as discussed below 
a significant increase in the unrealized gain on purchased power contracts due to increasing energy prices 
this unrealized gain added approximately million to pretax income  or per share  to the year ended december   as compared to the unrealized loss of  or less than per share  for the same period of a significant decrease in the supply cost balancing account 
during the year ended december   a reduction to the supply cost balancing account provision of approximately million was recorded pursuant to the approval by the cpuc in  of which million was for the increased supply costs incurred by gswc s region iii in and million was for years to furthermore  a cumulative million over collection in supply costs was recorded in may covering years to as a result of the advice letter filings pursuant to a new procedure set up by the cpuc 
this overall net reduction to the provision added about per share in water rate increases contributed approximately million to revenues  per share in the increases above were offset by the following a decrease in billed water consumption due to near record rainfall in southern california in the decrease in consumption negatively impacted earnings in by approximately per share 
a favorable decision issued by the cpuc in that resulted in a million pretax gain on the sale of water rights during the second quarter of offset by an impairment loss of  associated with related assets removed from rate base pursuant to this decision 
this million net gain added approximately per share to the year ended december  there was no such gain in a higher effective tax rate reduced earnings by per share resulting from differences between book and taxable income that are treated as flow through adjustments in accordance with regulatory requirements 
increases in various administrative and general expenses and other operating expenses  as discussed below 
operating revenues for the year ended december   revenues from water operations increased by million or compared to the year ended december  water revenues reflect rate increases in and covering almost all of gswc s water customers which contributed million in increased revenues and an increase in ccwc s rates effective october  which contributed approximately  in increased revenues  offset by a decrease of in billed water consumption due to near record rainfall in southern california in differences in temperature and rainfall in registrant s service areas impact sales of water to customers  causing fluctuations in registrant s revenues and earnings between comparable periods 
the number of water customers remained relatively flat between the two years 
for the year ended december   revenues from electric operations increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase reflects a rate increase related to the commencement of operations of an mw natural gas fueled generation facility 
the new rates went into effect on april  the rate increase for this facility is expected to generate approximately million in additional annual revenues and is subject to refund pending cpuc s final cost review 
the new rates have been recognized in revenues as management believes it is probable that the final cpuc cost review will not result in refunds to the customer 
the increase was offset by a decrease in kwh consumption 
in the beginning of january february  the ski resorts did not use as much power for snowmaking due to sufficient snowfall 
at the beginning of the winter season october december  the temperatures were too warm for snowmaking 
the lack of snowmaking combined with the decrease in visitors to the area in the later part of due to the lack of snow resulted in the decrease in kilowatt hour consumption 
for the year ended december   other operating revenues increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due primarily to approximately million of additional revenues associated with the operation and maintenance of the water and wastewater systems at fort bliss  located near el paso  texas that commenced on october  there was also million of construction revenues with the us government recorded in based on the percentage of completion for the construction of certain improvements to the existing water and wastewater systems at fort bliss 
these improvements were done under a million firm fixed price contract and were supplemental to the year contract with the us government to manage the entire water and wastewater systems at fort bliss 
the project was approximately complete as of december  these increases were offset by a million reduction recorded in september of gswc s estimate of customer refunds associated with lease revenues from the city of folsom 
operating expenses for the year ended december  and  and  respectively  of the company s supply mix was purchased water 
purchased water costs increased slightly by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due primarily to increases in supplier rates offset by a decline in customer demand resulting from lower consumption 
for the year ended december   the cost of power purchased for pumping decreased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due primarily to a decrease in kilowatt hour usage caused by lower customer demand 
for the year ended december   groundwater production assessments increased by as compared to the year ended december  due primarily to increases in assessment rates levied against groundwater production in regions ii and iii  effective july and average pump tax rates increased in regions ii and iii in july by approximately  and further increased by and  respectively  in july in addition  gswc received  for leasing temporary surplus water rights during the year ended december  which was recorded as a reduction to groundwater production assessments as compared to  received for the year ended december  these increases were partially offset by a decrease in well production due to a decline in customer demand 
for the year ended december   cost of power purchased for resale to customers in gswc s bear valley electric division decreased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was due primarily to two related events with mirant marketing 
the first event was the recording of additional one time costs for the year ended december  that did not recur in the additional one time costs recorded in was due to a refund to mirant marketing of  ordered by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc in march of for the one time sale of excess energy in the spot market 
while this increased the cost of power purchased for resale  gswc also booked the refund payment to mirant marketing in its supply cost balancing account  therefore  there was no net impact on earnings in the second event was the result of a ferc order in november of in which ferc ordered mirant marketing to reimburse  of the amount gswc had refunded to mirant marketing 
gswc received the reimbursement of  plus interest  from mirant marketing in may of gswc recorded the mirant marketing reimbursement in its supply cost balancing account which also resulted in no net impact on earnings in in addition  there was a decrease of  which was caused by increases in gswc s sales of surplus energy into the spot market in  compared to net sales of surplus in finally  there was a  decrease in fuel costs due to less frequent operation of the new generating plant in compared to the new generating plant  which went into service during the fourth quarter of  is only operated when it is believed to be economical 
it was operating more frequently in to acquire the air quality permit and to verify the warranty before its expiration in september of unrealized gain and loss on purchased power contracts represents gains and losses recorded for gswc s purchased power agreements with pwcc  which qualify as derivative instruments under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the  pretax unrealized gain on purchased power contracts for the year ended december  is due to an increase in the current forward market prices since december  as of december   gswc has recorded a cumulative unrealized gain of million on its balance sheet since the inception of these contracts 
unrealized gains and losses at bear valley electric will continue to impact earnings during the life of the contract with pwcc  which terminates in a decrease of million during the year ended december  in the provision for supply cost balancing accounts as compared to the year ended december  primarily reflects i the recording in of a net million regulatory liability with a corresponding charge booked to the supply cost balancing account provision representing potential refund of supply costs from late to  ii approval by the cpuc in june and october to recover an approximate million under collection in region iii s memorandum supply cost accounts  iii the recording of million in net under collections in all water regions for s memorandum supply cost accounts  iv a decrease in of  in amortization based on previously authorized surcharges to either collect or refund balances primarily related to pre november water supply cost balancing accounts and the electric balancing account  and v a decrease of  in the electric supply cost amounts in excess of the per mwh recovery cap authorized by the cpuc 
these decreases were offset by the net refunds to mirant marketing previously discussed in cost of power purchased for resale in gswc s bear valley electric service area 
for the year ended december   other operating expenses increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due primarily to i higher labor costs as a result of higher wages and employee headcount which increased by approximately  at gswc  ii higher net operating expenses of  at asus due to the commencement of operations of the water and wastewater system at fort bliss  iii higher chemicals and water treatment costs of  at gswc  and iv an impairment loss of  recorded in the fourth quarter of as a result of the final decision issued by the cpuc in region iii s general rate case 
these increases were offset by i a one time write off related to an impairment loss of  that was recorded at the end of the second quarter of related to the charnock groundwater basin assets being removed from rate base pursuant to a cpuc order in  and ii a  adjustment in the third quarter of reflecting the approval from the cpuc of recovery of previously incurred operating expenses in the aerojet memorandum account 
for the year ended december   administrative and general expenses increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due to i an approximate million increase in pensions and benefits due to changes in actuarial assumptions with respect to the discount rate and mortality tables used in calculating the expense  and increases of approximately million in various other benefit costs due primarily to increases in medical and labor costs  and bonuses earned in of approximately  which were not earned in  ii an approximate  increase in gswc s general office labor costs due to higher wages  and iii an approximate  increase at fbws due to the commencement of operations of the water and wastewater system at fort bliss 
these increases were partially offset by i a million decrease in outside services in connection with new business development and other matters  and ii a net decrease of approximately  in various other miscellaneous expenses 
for the year ended december   depreciation and amortization expense increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  reflecting  among other things  the effects of recording approximately million in additions to utility plant during  depreciation on which began in january this increase was offset by a decrease in depreciation expense resulting from the cpuc decision on the aerojet matter  discussed previously  which ordered gswc to restore approximately million to the appropriate plant accounts and decrease depreciation expense 
registrant anticipates that depreciation expense will continue to increase due to registrant s on going construction program at its regulated subsidiaries 
registrant believes that depreciation expense related to property additions approved by the appropriate regulatory agency will be recovered through water and electric rates 
for the year ended december   maintenance expense increased slightly by compared to the year ended december  there was higher maintenance expense of  due principally to increases in scheduled maintenance and emergency repairs at gswc s region iii and an increase of  in maintenance expenses for fbws due to the commencement of operations at fort bliss in october each of the military utility privatization subsidiaries bears the risk of increases in maintenance and all other costs above those authorized in the contract for operation of the water and wastewater systems for the us army and air force  unless it is entitled to an equitable adjustment for such matters as an increase in labor rates  changes in circumstances or differing site conditions from those anticipated at the time of execution of the contract 
these increases were offset by decreases in maintenance expense at gswc s regions i  ii and bear valley electric of  as well as decreases at ccwc of  for the year ended december   property and other taxes increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  reflecting an increase of approximately  in additional property taxes resulting from higher assessed values  and increases in payroll taxes of approximately  based on increased labor costs 
for the year ended december   asus recorded construction expenses of million reflecting the costs incurred based on the percentage of completion of certain capital improvements to the existing water and wastewater systems at fort bliss 
these improvements were done under a million firm fixed price contract and were supplemental to the year contract with the us government to manage the entire water and wastewater systems at fort bliss 
the project was approximately complete as of december  for the year ended december   registrant recorded a million pretax gain on the sale of water rights reflecting a favorable cpuc decision in the million represented settlement proceeds received in may from the city of santa monica relating to the sale and the assignment of rights regarding the charnock groundwater basin 
for the year ended december   registrant recorded a net pretax gain of  on a settlement reached with fhsd in february for the capping of two ccwc wells in order to facilitate fhsd s ability to secure certain permits 
pursuant to the settlement agreement  ccwc agreed to permanently remove from service and cap one of its wells  and cap another well which had never been used as a potable source of supply 
interest expense for the year ended december   interest charges decreased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  reflecting the approval from the cpuc of previously incurred and expensed carrying costs totaling million in the aerojet memorandum account  discussed previously 
this was offset by increases in short term borrowings and higher interest rates on short term borrowings of  and increases in long term debt interest expense of  due to  of additional private placement notes issued in october in addition  during the first quarter of gswc recorded the recovery of carrying costs of approximately  with respect to the costs incurred in connection with the cpuc s investigation of water quality matters relating to public utilities regulated by the cpuc which was authorized by the cpuc in march there was no corresponding recovery in interest income for the year ended december   interest income increased to million as compared to  for the year ended december  due primarily to the recognition in july of  in interest income earned on the million aerojet long term note receivable 
the recording of the interest income had been deferred pending the final cpuc decision on the aerojet matter 
registrant has since been recording the interest income on the million aerojet long term note receivable on a monthly basis
