table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  consistent with the requirements of fin  we adopted this new interpretation on january  we are currently evaluating the provisions of fin and have not yet determined the impact  if any  on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands the disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements 
this statement  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   applies to most fasb pronouncements that require fair value measurement but does not in itself require any new fair value measurements 
we are currently evaluating the provisions of sfas but have not yet determined the impact  if any  on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab  guidance on materiality 
the new guidance requires the use of both a balance sheet and income statement approach in quantifying and evaluating the materiality of misstatements in the financial statements 
while the income statement approach addresses only misstatements related to the current year financial statements  the balance sheet approach takes into account unadjusted cumulative misstatements existing in the balance sheet at the end of the current period 
under the transition guidance in sab  correction of errors from prior periods that existed in the balance sheet which had been previously considered immaterial could be treated as a one time cumulative effect adjustment and would not require restatement of prior periods 
sab is effective for annual financial statements covering the first fiscal year ending after november  the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas permits all entities to choose to measure many eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
a business entity shall report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after november  we are currently evaluating the provisions of sfas  but have not yet determined the impact  if any  on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition and long lived assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues from construction contracts  which are generally recognized using the percentage of completion method  are measured by relating the actual cost of work performed to date to the current estimated total cost of the respective contract the cost to cost option of the percentage of completion method 
contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect vessel costs including depreciation and amortization  labor  supplies  and repairs 
certain costs may be excluded from the cost to cost method of measuring progress  such as significant costs for materials and major third party subcontractors  if it appears that such exclusion would result in a more meaningful measurement of actual contract progress and resulting periodic allocation of income 
provisions for estimated losses  if any  on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
selling  general  and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred 
we also provide services on a day rate basis to many of our customers 
revenues for day rate services are recognized as the services are rendered if collectability is reasonably assured 
significant changes in cost estimates due to adverse market conditions or poor contract performance could affect estimated gross profit  possibly resulting in a contract loss 
moreover  adjustments  if any  are reflected in income in the period when any adjustment is determined 
to the extent that an adjustment results in a reduction of previously reported profits  we could recognize a significant charge against current earnings to reflect the adjustment 
in addition  we include claims and unapproved change orders to the extent of costs incurred in contract revenues when the contract or other evidence provides a legal basis for the claim  additional costs are not the result of deficiencies in our performance  costs are identifiable  and evidence supporting the claim is objective and verifiable 
receivables our receivables include both billed and unbilled receivables 
these receivables often include claims and unapproved change orders 
the claims and unapproved change orders included in our receivables  amounted to million at december  and million at december  retainage  which represents amounts which are billed to customers but not yet due per the terms of the underlying contract  was million at december  approximately  million of this amount is expected to be collected in retainage at december  was million 
we continually monitor our receivables for collectability and make the appropriate allowances when deemed necessary 
property and equipment long lived assets held and used by us primarily marine vessels and related equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we assess the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying values of an asset group can be recovered through projected net cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges  based on expected operating results over the remaining life of the asset group 
the 
table of contents cash flow estimates are based on historical data adjusted for management estimates of future market performance that rely on existing market data  industry wide trends  and expected vessel day rates  utilization  and margins 
management s estimates may vary considerably from actual outcomes due to future adverse market conditions  poor operating results  or other factors that could result in our inability to recover the current carrying value of the long lived asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of acquired businesses 
the company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value 
recoverability is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill applies to the carrying value  including goodwill  of that reporting unit 
income taxes the liability method is used for determining our income taxes  under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates 
under this method  the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in determining the need for valuation allowances  we have considered and made judgments and estimates regarding estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
these estimates and judgments include some degree of uncertainty and changes in these estimates and assumptions could require us to adjust the valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets 
historically  changes to valuation allowances have been caused by major changes in the business cycle in certain countries and changes in local country law 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets depends on the generation of sufficient taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions 
at december   we had available net operating loss nol carryforwards for foreign jurisdiction purposes of approximately million  which  if not used  will expire between and one foreign jurisdiction has an indefinite nol carryforward period 
we believe that it is more likely than not that all of the million nol carryforwards in our latin america segment will be utilized prior to their expiration 
a valuation allowance has been set up for the remaining foreign nol carryforwards as we do not believe that they will be utilized prior to their expiration 
in certain situations  we provide for taxes where assessments have not been received 
in those situations  we consider it probable that the taxes ultimately payable will exceed those amounts reflected in filed tax returns  accordingly  taxes are provided in those situations under the guidance in sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
future events such as changes in the facts or tax law  judicial decisions regarding existing law or a favorable audit outcome may later indicate the assertion of additional taxes is no longer probable 
in such circumstances  it is possible that taxes previously provided would be released 
please see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements which will affect the way we account for income taxes in future periods 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk due to the international nature of our business operations and the variable interest rate provisions of our revolving credit facility  we are exposed to certain risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
most of our business operations are conducted in foreign countries which use currencies other than our functional currency 
we use natural hedging techniques to manage the foreign exchange risks associated with our foreign operations by contracting  to the extent possible  international construction jobs to be payable in us dollars 
we also  to the extent possible  maintain cash balances at foreign locations in us dollar accounts 
we do not believe that a change in currency rates in the regions in which we operate would have a significant effect on our results of operations 
from time to time  we also make significant contractual commitments which are denominated in foreign currencies 
at december   we had significant contractual commitments which were denominated in norwegian kroners and euros 
our norwegian kroner commitments at december   which result from two long term vessel charters  will require the use of million kroners or million as of december  over the next five years 
as of december   we had hedged all of our non cancellable norwegian kroner commitments related to these vessel charters at an average rate of kroners per dollar and were no longer exposed to the risk of fluctuations in the kroner dollar exchange rate 
hedge accounting treatment for the derivative financial instruments which are associated with the norwegian kroner described above is dependent upon whether or not these hedges are considered to be effective as defined in sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
if these hedges become ineffective as defined by sfas  we will be required to include the changes in fair market value of these instruments in our results of operations 
for more information about our derivative positions  please see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report 
our euro commitments  which result from commitments to purchase equipment  will require the use of million euros or million as of december  over the next two years 
during the second quarter of  we entered into forward exchange agreements  at an average rate of dollars per euro  to hedge against the risk of variations in the euro dollar exchange rate with respect to these euro commitments 
in december  as a result of changes in our expectations regarding the occurrence and timing of cash payments related to these euro commitments  our hedge with respect to our euro commitments became less effective than was originally forecast 
consequently  although management still considers the derivative financial instruments associated with our euro commitments to be a reasonable economic hedge of our euro commitments  these derivative financial instruments no longer qualify for hedge accounting as per sfas during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a net derivative gain of million related to these derivative instruments  and will record changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments in our earnings until the contracts are settled 
a decline in the value of the euro with respect to the us dollar would decrease the us dollar value of our euro commitments at december  by approximately million and create a derivative loss in our reported earnings of approximately million 
due to uncertainty regarding the occurrence and timing of cash payments related to our euro commitments  we are also exposed to the risk that any derivative losses which are incurred may not be recovered in future periods through a reduction of depreciation expense related to the assets acquired via our euro commitments or in some other manner 
as of december   we had no amounts drawn against our revolving credit facility and had no hedging instruments with respect to interest rates 
at december   we had million of fixed interest rate long term debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of approximately and a market value of approximately million 
a decline in the general level of interest rates would increase the market value of our long term debt by approximately million
