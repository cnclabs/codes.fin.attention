item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion of results of operations  liquidity and capital resources contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
as described under the heading important information regarding forward looking statements at the beginning of this report  our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in these forward looking statements 
factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below and in the section above entitled risk factors 
unless otherwise indicated  all common stock related amounts have been adjusted to reflect our one for six reverse stock split effective september  critical accounting policies basis of revenue recognition to date  we do not have any significant ongoing revenue sources 
on occasion  we derive significant revenue from the sale or licensing of our patented technologies and from government grants 
pursuant to the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
sab and emerging issues task force consensus no 
 revenues from collaborative agreements are recognized as earned as we perform research activities under the terms of each agreement 
billings in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue 
to the extent that a transaction contains multiple deliverables  we determine whether the multiple deliverables are separable  and  if separable  the revenue to be allocated to each deliverable based on fair value 
if fair value is undeterminable for undelivered elements of the arrangement  revenue is deferred over the contract period or until delivery  as applicable 
the revenue allocated to each deliverable is recognized following the requirements of sab for a detailed description of our revenue recognition policy  refer to note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets as of december   we had approximately million of property and equipment 
in accounting for these long lived assets  we make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets  the expected residual values of the assets  and the potential for impairment based on events or circumstances 
the events or circumstances could include a significant decrease in market value  a significant change in asset condition or a significant adverse change in regulatory climate 
application of the test for impairment requires judgment 
in june  we recognized an asset impairment loss of million on certain facilities and equipment resulting from our decision to terminate our str program 
the loss on the equipment at the seattle facility was determined based on estimates of potential sales values of used equipment and other selling costs 
in december  we recognized an additional impairment loss of million on the denton manufacturing facility  which was based on our evaluation of market data for this property 
we used a fair value of million for the denton facility in determining the total impairment loss as of december  due to the inherent uncertainty of the timing of any sale of the denton facility  we have classified this asset as a long term asset held for sale 
long term debt we assumed a note payable to texas state bank in connection with the acquisition of our radiopharmaceutical manufacturing facility in denton  texas 
in may  we paid off the million balance outstanding on the note 
in october  we entered into a loan and security agreement the loan agreement with silicon valley bank and merrill lynch capital  which is secured by a first lien on substantially all of our non intellectual property assets 
under the loan agreement  we received capital loan proceeds of million on october  the term is for months with maturity on april  we are required to pay a fixed interest rate on the outstanding principal balance plus a million additional payment on the maturity date of the loan 
this additional payment will be accreted to the note payable balance over the term of the loan using the effective interest rate method and reflected as additional interest expense 
the loan agreement also contains covenants requiring us  not later than december   to provide evidence of positive phase ii data for the picoplatin drug development program and commence enrollment of patients in a phase iii trial for picoplatin 
the failure to satisfy these covenants could result in acceleration of our payment obligations under the loan agreement 
in connection with the loan agreement  we issued five year warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the portion of the loan proceeds allocable to the warrants is  based on their relative fair value  which we recorded as additional discount to notes payable 
we classify the portion of the loan that is due for payment in and thereafter as a long term payable 
stock compensation beginning january   we account for share based compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payments  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
we use the black scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of our stock options at the date of grant 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
our employee stock options  however  have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options 
for example  employee stock options are generally subject to vesting restrictions and are generally not transferable 
in addition  option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility  the expected life of an option and the number of awards ultimately expected to vest 
changes in subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates of an option 
furthermore  the estimated fair value of an option does not necessarily represent the value that will ultimately be realized by an employee 
we use historical data  and other related information as appropriate  to estimate the expected price volatility  the expected option life and the expected forfeiture rate 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of a grant 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating the key assumptions  we may be required to increase or decrease compensation expense  which could be material to our results of operations 
see new accounting pronouncements below for additional information 
results of operations year ended december  compared with december  we had no revenue for  while our revenues for totaled  revenue for consisted primarily of royalty payments 
total operating expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in total operating expenses for the year ended december  included an asset impairment charge of million 
additionally  a restructuring charge of million was incurred in relating to termination benefits for the reduction in staff and other costs related to the termination of our str program 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  increased to million  from million for the same period in among the primary components of the increase in were higher clinical costs of million associated with our picoplatin trials and increased costs of million for other r d efforts  offset by decreased costs of million related to the termination of activities related to our str program and decreased costs of million related to our patent portfolio maintenance 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in the increase in g a costs was due primarily to million of stock option expense recorded in connection with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standard r and million of expense related to special shareholder meetings 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to interest expense of million for the same period in the million increase in interest expense for was due primarily to the amortization of debt discount in the amount of million related to the bridge financing and million related to the silicon valley bank loan  which transactions are discussed below 
the increase in interest income of million for compared to is due to the income from the investment of excess cash from our equity financing 
we received approximately million in net cash proceeds from the sale of common stock and warrants in april the equity financing 
in connection with the financing  we issued to a group of institutional and other accredited investors an aggregate of million shares of common stock at a cash purchase price of per share 
investors in the financing also received five year warrants to purchase an aggregate of million shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
as part of the equity financing  we received a million bridge loan in february from investors in the equity financing 
pursuant the bridge loan  we issued five year warrants to purchase an aggregate of approximately  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
we used the funds received in the bridge financing for working capital pending receipt of required shareholder approvals and satisfaction of other conditions to completion of the equity financing 
the outstanding principal amount of the bridge notes issued to the investors  together with  of accrued interest  automatically converted  at a conversion price of per share  into  shares of common stock at the closing of the equity financing 
cash and cash equivalents as of december  were million  compared with million at december  as discussed below  we currently are conducting multiple ongoing studies of picoplatin and plan to initiate a phase iii pivotal study in the first half of in addition  we relocated our corporate headquarters to office space and laboratory facilities in south san francisco under a five year lease 
these  as well as increases in personnel and other plans for future growth  are expected to result in significant increases in our future operating costs  including research and development and administrative expenses 
we will require substantial additional funding to support our picoplatin and any other clinical development programs and to fund our operations 
in the event that we do not obtain sufficient additional funds  we may be required to delay  reduce or curtail the scope of our picoplatin and other proposed development activities 
preferred dividends on series preferred stock were million in both and year ended december  compared with december  our revenues for totaled  which primarily consisted of royalty payments 
our revenues for totaled million  which consisted primarily of milestone payments from boston scientific corporation 
total operating expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in research and development expenses for the year ended december  decreased to million  from million for the same period in among the primary components of the decrease were a million decrease in costs related to the str program  offset by a million increase in picoplatin program development costs  a million reduction in shared cost reimbursements and a million increase in development related overhead costs 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in the decrease in g a costs was due primarily to a decrease of million for personnel related costs 
in march  we raised approximately million in net proceeds from the sale in a private placement of million shares of common stock 
in connection with this private placement  we issued five year warrants to purchase an aggregate of million shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants became exercisable beginning september  and are exercisable at any time during their term 
until may  our major research and development program had been str  a bone targeting radiotherapeutic 
in may  we announced the immediate implementation of a strategic restructuring program to refocus our limited resources on the development of picoplatin 
the restructuring plan  which was completed in june  included the discontinuation of our str development program  including halting patient enrollment in our phase iii trial of str in multiple myeloma  ceasing operations at our denton  texas facility  where str was manufactured  and reducing our workforce by approximately 
we recorded restructuring charges against operations totaling million during this charge consisted of severance costs totaling million associated with the reduction in workforce and contract termination and decommissioning costs of million 
we evaluated our str assets in light of the restructuring and determined that a likely impairment existed on those assets 
we recorded a charge of million against operations in june to reflect such impairment 
the asset impairment charge reflects the difference in the estimated fair value of assets as compared to the net book value of assets employed in our str program 
in conjunction with our strategic restructuring  in june we negotiated the early termination of our str related supply agreement with the university of missouri research reactor facility group murr 
we paid murr a fee of  in connection with such early termination 
we also paid murr  in minimum purchase requirements under the agreement during other income totaled million in and  respectively 
these amounts consisted of interest income of million  offset by interest expense of million 
preferred dividends on series preferred stock were million in both and major research and development programs our major research and development program during the fiscal year ended december  was picoplatin  a next generation platinum based cancer therapy 
our major research and development program during the fiscal years ended december  and was skeletal targeted radiotherapy str  a bone targeting radiotherapeutic 
in may  we discontinued our str development program and refocused our resources on the development of picoplatin 
this restructuring included terminating patient enrollment in our phase iii trial of str in multiple myeloma  ceasing operations at our denton facility  where str was manufactured  and reducing our workforce by approximately 
picoplatin program 
picoplatin is a platinum based chemotherapeutic designed to overcome platinum resistance in the treatment of solid tumors 
we completed patient enrollment in our phase ii clinical study of picoplatin in small cell lung cancer in august and  based on positive median overall survival data from that ongoing study  plan to initiate a phase iii pivotal trial of picoplatin in small cell lung cancer in the first half of in may  we treated our first patients in separate phase i ii studies evaluating picoplatin in the front line treatment of advanced colorectal cancer and hormone refractory prostate cancer 
we expect to complete patient enrollment in these ongoing phase i trials and initiate the phase ii components of these trials during the first half of as of december   we have incurred costs of approximately million in connection with our picoplatin clinical program since the program s inception in total estimated costs of our picoplatin phase ii trial in small cell lung cancer are expected to be in the range of million to million through  including the cost of drug supply 
total estimated costs of our picoplatin phase i ii trial in colorectal cancer and our phase i ii trial in hormone refractory prostate cancer are expected to be in the ranges of million to million and million to million  respectively  through  including the cost of drug supply 
these costs could be substantially higher if we have to repeat  revise or expand the scope of any of our trials 
material cash inflows relating to our picoplatin development program will not commence unless and until we complete required clinical trials and obtain fda marketing approvals  and then only if picoplatin finds acceptance in the marketplace 
to date  we have not received any revenues from product sales of picoplatin 
the risks and uncertainties associated with completing the development of picoplatin on schedule  or at all  include the following  as well as the other risks and uncertainties described in this report we may not have adequate funds to complete the development of picoplatin  we may be unable to secure adequate supplies of picoplatin active pharmaceutical ingredient and finished drug product in order to complete our clinical trials  picoplatin may not be shown to be safe and efficacious in clinical trials  and we may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals of the drug or may be unable to obtain such approvals on a timely basis 
if we fail to obtain marketing approvals for picoplatin  are unable to secure adequate clinical and commercial supplies of picoplatin active pharmaceutical ingredient and finished drug product  or do not complete development and obtain united states and foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis  our operations  financial position and liquidity could be severely impaired  including as follows we would not earn any sales revenue from picoplatin  which would increase the likelihood that we would need to obtain additional financing for our other research and development efforts  and our reputation among investors might be harmed  which could make it more difficult for us to obtain equity capital on attractive terms  or at all 
because of the many risks and uncertainties relating to completion of clinical trials  receipt of marketing approvals and acceptance in the marketplace  we cannot predict the period in which material cash inflows from our picoplatin program will commence  if ever 
discontinued str program 
str is a radiotherapeutic designed to deliver radiation specifically to sites of cancer in the bone and bone marrow 
we have incurred costs of approximately million in connection with the str program since the program s inception in we terminated our str development program in may total estimated costs to complete our str phase iii clinical trial and potentially obtain marketing approval were in the range of million  including cost of clinical drug supply 
these costs would have been substantially higher if we were required to repeat  revise or expand the scope of our trials or conduct additional clinical trials 
discontinuation of our str development program relieved us of the annual costs associated with the program  including manufacturing  clinical trial and personnel costs 
during these costs were approximately million 
during these costs were approximately million 
we are actively seeking a buyer for our denton manufacturing facility and our other str related assets 
given the inherent uncertainty of the timing of a sale of the denton facility  we have classified this asset as long term 
str was a clinical stage product for which no marketing approvals had been obtained 
we had no material cash inflows relating to our str development and did not receive any revenues from product sales of str 
due to our decision to curtail our str development program  there is neither an anticipated completion date nor an expected period during which material cash inflows will commence 
as a consequence of the restructuring  we are not dependent on the successful development and completion of our str program 
summary of research and development costs 
our development administration overhead costs  consisting of rent  utilities  consulting fees  patent costs and other various overhead costs  are included in total research and development expense for each period  but are not allocated among our various projects 
our total research and development costs include the costs of various research efforts directed toward the identification and evaluation of future product candidates 
these other research projects are preclinical and not considered major projects 
our total research and development costs are summarized below summary of research and development costs in thousands picoplatin discontinued programs other overhead and research costs total research and development costs liquidity and capital resources we have historically suffered recurring operating losses and negative cash flows from operations 
as of december   we had net working capital of million  an accumulated deficit of million and total shareholders equity of million 
we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  technology licensing  collaborative agreements and debt instruments 
we invest excess cash in investment securities that will be used to fund future operating costs 
cash used for operating activities for the twelve months ended december  totaled million 
revenues and other income sources for were not sufficient to cover operating expenses 
cash  cash equivalents and investment securities  net of restricted cash of million  totaled million at december  compared to million at december  we believe that our cash  cash equivalent and investment securities balances will provide adequate resources to fund operations at least until the end of the first quarter of on april   we completed a million equity financing  pursuant to which we issued to a group of institutional and other accredited investors an aggregate of million shares of common stock at a cash purchase price of per share 
investors in the financing also received five year warrants to purchase an aggregate of million shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
we received million in net proceeds from the financing  which we are using to fund our picoplatin clinical program and general working capital needs 
concurrent with the closing of the financing  we issued an aggregate of million shares of common stock to the holders of our series b preferred stock upon conversion of their outstanding series b preferred shares 
as a result of the completion of the financing and the conversion of the series b preferred shares  our outstanding common stock increased from approximately million shares to approximately million shares 
entities affiliated with mpm capital management mpm acquired beneficial ownership of million common shares  or approximately of our common stock outstanding immediately following the financing 
entities affiliated with bay city capital management iv llc bcc acquired beneficial ownership of million common shares  or approximately of the common shares outstanding immediately following the financing 
two of our directors  fred b 
craves and carl s 
goldfischer  are managing directors of bcc and possess capital and carried interests in the bcc entities that participated in the financing 
we have agreed  for as long as mpm owns at least of the shares of common stock and warrants purchased in the financing  to use our best efforts to cause one person designated by mpm and one person designated by mutual agreement of mpm and bcc to be nominated and elected to our board of directors 
nicholas j 
simon iii  a representative of mpm  was appointed to our board of directors on april  mr 
simon is a general partner of certain of the mpm entities that participated in the financing and possesses capital and carried interests in those entities 
in connection with the financing  we entered into a letter agreement with texas state bank  pursuant to which we agreed to accelerate the maturity date of our promissory note with the bank to june  the texas state bank note  which was secured by our radiopharmaceutical plant and other str assets located in denton  texas  had an adjustable interest rate equal to the bank prime rate reported in the wall street journal at may  
we paid off the outstanding balance of the note  million  on may  we completed the relocation of our corporate headquarters to south san francisco in september we intend to maintain our current clinical and development and support activities in seattle 
the addition of  square feet of office and laboratory space leased in south san francisco facility will result in a substantial increase in our future rent and operating costs 
under the lease agreement dated july   the annual base rent for the leased facilities is approximately  and is subject to annual adjustment based on disbursements for tenant improvements and increases in the consumer price index in the san francisco metropolitan market 
base rent is payable in monthly installments of approximately  additional rent is payable monthly based on our share of operating expenses of the project in which the leased facilities are located  as described in the lease agreement 
monthly base rent during the first seven months of the lease will average  during the construction of tenant improvements 
we paid total rent base rent and additional rent based on our share of project operating expenses during of  we estimate total rent payable by us during will be approximately  annual operating expenses payable under the lease may increase substantially as we move forward with our plans to establish laboratory facilities in the leased space 
the initial term of the lease is months 
we may  upon written notice delivered at least nine months prior to expiration of the initial lease term  extend the lease for an additional three years  with rent payable at the then market rate 
in april  we acquired the worldwide exclusive rights  excluding japan  to develop  manufacture and commercialize picoplatin from anormed  inc anormed was acquired by genzyme corporation in november under the terms of the original agreement  we paid a one time upfront milestone payment of million in common stock and million in cash 
the original agreement provided for development and commercialization milestone payments of up to million  payable in cash or a combination of cash and common stock  and a royalty rate of up to of net product sales after regulatory approval 
the parties executed an amendment to the license agreement on september   modifying several key financial terms and expanding the licensed territory to include japan  thereby providing us worldwide rights 
in consideration of the amendment  we paid genzyme million in cash on october  and will pay genzyme an additional million in cash by march  the amendment eliminates in development milestone payments to genzyme 
genzyme remains entitled to receive up to million in commercialization milestones upon the attainment of certain levels of annual net sales of picoplatin after regulatory approval 
the amendment also reduces the royalty payable to genzyme to a maximum of of annual net product sales 
in addition  the amendment reduces the sharing of sublicense revenues for any sublicenses entered into during the first year following the amendment and eliminates the sharing of sublicense revenues on and after september  on october   we entered into a loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank and merrill lynch capital  pursuant to which we obtained a million capital loan 
a portion of the proceeds of the loan will be used to fund our cash payment obligations to genzyme under the amended license agreement described above 
the remaining proceeds will be used to support our strategic growth  late stage clinical trials of picoplatin and general working capital needs 
the loan is for a term of months and matures on april  we are required to pay a fixed interest rate on the outstanding principal balance plus a million additional payment upon the maturity date of the loan 
this additional payment will be accreted to the note payable balance over the term of the loan using the effective interest rate method and reflected as additional interest expense 
all interest payable under the loan agreement and the full amount of the additional payment must be paid upon any prepayment of the loan 
the loan is secured by a first lien on substantially all of our non intellectual property assets 
the loan agreement contains restrictions on our ability to  among other things  dispose of certain assets  engage in certain mergers and acquisition transactions  incur indebtedness  create liens on assets  make investments and pay dividends or repurchase stock 
the loan agreement also contains covenants requiring us to maintain unrestricted cash of million during the loan term and  not later than december   to provide evidence of positive phase ii data for the picoplatin drug development program and commence enrollment of patients in a phase iii trial for picoplatin 
the loan contains events of default that include  among other things  nonpayment of principal and interest or fees  breaches of covenants  material adverse changes  bankruptcy and insolvency events  cross defaults to other indebtedness  material judgments  inaccuracy of representations and warranties and events constituting a change of control 
the occurrence of an event of default would increase the applicable rate of interest by and could result in acceleration of our payment obligations under the loan agreement 
on august   we entered into a research funding and option agreement with the scripps research institute tsri 
under the agreement  as amended in december  we committed to provide tsri an aggregate of million over a month period to fund research relating to synthesis and evaluation of novel small molecule  multi targeted protein kinase inhibitors and focal adhesion kinase inhibitors as therapeutic agents  including for the treatment of cancer 
we have the option to negotiate a worldwide exclusive license to use  enhance and develop any compounds arising from the collaboration 
the research funding is payable by us to tsri quarterly in accordance with a negotiated budget 
on august   we made an initial funding payment to tsri of  we paid tsri total funding payments of million in  which amount was charged to r d expense 
the agreement provides for aggregate additional funding payments of million in we have no assurance that the research funded under this arrangement will be successful or ultimately will give rise to any viable product candidates 
further  there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate  on acceptable terms  a license with respect to any compounds arising from the collaboration 
in april  we sold and transferred our pretarget intellectual property to aletheon pharmaceuticals  inc under that agreement  we could receive up to million in milestone payments if aletheon achieves certain development goals  plus royalties on potential future product sales 
we did not receive any upfront consideration for the sale of the pretarget property 
we discontinued our clinical studies using the pretarget technology in july  and sought  both through targeted inquiries and a broad based auction process  a buyer or licensee for the technology 
the sale of the pretarget intellectual property relieved us of the annual costs associated with maintaining the pretarget patent estate 
during  we spent approximately  for the prosecution and maintenance of the pretarget patents and trademarks 
for  these costs were approximately  seattle based aletheon is a development stage biotherapeutics company founded by two former poniard employees 
the timing and amount of milestone payments  if any  are uncertain 
the terms of the transaction were determined through arms length negotiation 
we raised approximately million in net proceeds from the sale of common stock and warrants in a private placement transaction in march we used the net proceeds from that financing to support our phase ii trial in picoplatin in small cell lung cancer and for general working capital  including restructuring costs associated with the termination of our str development program 
we raised approximately million in net proceeds from the sale of common stock and warrants in a private placement transaction in february the net proceeds from that financing were used to support our str development program  which we discontinued in may  and for general working capital 
we terminated our str manufacturing operations in denton  texas during the second quarter of and began actively marketing the facility for sale 
in  we recorded costs associated with the closure and maintenance of the denton facility of approximately  we recorded costs of approximately  in related to these activities 
we will require substantial additional funding to develop and commercialize picoplatin and any other proposed products and to fund our operations 
management is continuously exploring financing alternatives  including raising additional capital through the public or private sale of equity or debt securities or through the establishment of credit or other funding facilities  and entering into strategic collaborations  which may include joint ventures or partnerships for product development and commercialization  merger  sale of assets or other similar transactions 
our actual capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the scope and timing of our picoplatin clinical program and other research and development efforts  including the progress and costs of our ongoing phase ii and planned phase iii trials of picoplatin in small cell lung cancer  our ability to obtain clinical supplies of picoplatin active pharmaceutical ingredient and finished drug product in a timely and cost effective manner  actions taken by the fda and other regulatory authorities  the timing and amounts of proceeds from any sale of the denton facility and assets  the timing and amount of any milestone or other payments we might receive from potential strategic partners  our degree of success in commercializing picoplatin or any other cancer therapy product candidates  the emergence of competing technologies and products  and other adverse market developments  the acquisition or in licensing of other products or intellectual property  the costs  including lease and operating costs  incurred in connection with the relocation of our corporate headquarters to south san francisco and the planned expansion of our workforce  the costs of any research collaborations or strategic partnerships established  the costs of preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and the costs of performing our obligations under the loan with silicon valley bank and merrill lynch capital  including the cost of interest and other payment obligations and penalties and the cost of complying with unrestricted cash  product development and other covenants and restrictions under the loan agreement 
during  we experienced significant changes to our capital structure which resulted in an ownership change  as defined under section of the irc 
consequently  the amount of net operating loss carryforwards and research and experimentation credit carryforwards available to be used in future years are limited under irc sections and this limitation will result in the loss of approximately million of our net operating loss carryforwards and million of our research and development credit carryforwards 
we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million available for future use as of december   which will expire from through there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital or enter into relationships with corporate partners on a timely basis  on favorable terms  or at all 
conditions in the capital markets in general  and in the life science capital market specifically  may affect our potential financing sources and opportunities for strategic partnering 
our financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis  however  our inability to obtain additional cash as needed could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and our ability to continue in existence 
our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
at december   we had the following contractual obligations in thousands total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations long term debt obligations notes payable operating lease obligations seattle office space south san francisco premises purchase obligations scripps research collaboration total lease executed in july see discussion above for details

sfas establishes  unless impracticable  retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to a newly adopted accounting principle 
previously  most changes in accounting principle were recognized by including the cumulative effect of the change to the new accounting principle in net income of the period of the change 
under sfas  retrospective application requires the cumulative effect of the change to be reflected in the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the first period presented and financial statements for each individual prior period presented to be adjusted to reflect the effects of applying the new accounting principle 
sfas carries forward the guidance in apb opinion accounting changes  requiring justification of a change in accounting principle on the basis of preferability  for reporting the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements and for a change in an accounting estimate

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt securities included in the company s investment portfolio 
the company does not have any derivative financial instruments 
the company invests in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and in high quality corporate issuers 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates decrease 
due in part to these factors  the company s future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or the company may experience losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
at december   the company owned government debt instruments totaling million and owned corporate debt securities totaling million 
the company s exposure to losses as a result of interest rate changes is managed through investing primarily in securities with relatively short maturities of up to two years and securities with variable interest rates 
all government debt instruments and corporate debt securities owned by the company at december  had maturities of less than one year
