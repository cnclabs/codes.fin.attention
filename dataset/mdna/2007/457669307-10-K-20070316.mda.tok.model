item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion also should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview insmed incorporated is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of drugs to treat metabolic diseases and endocrine disorders within niche markets that have unmet medical needs 
our development activities involve drugs that modulate igf activity in the human body 
in the past  we were focused on development and commercialization of iplex  our once daily igf replacement therapy  for the treatment short stature disorders 
iplex is a complex of recombinant human igf i and its binding protein igfbp rhigf i rhigfbp 
iplex was approved by the fda for the treatment of short stature disorders  in december and was commercially launched in the second quarter of as a result of our recent settlement agreement with tercica and genentech  as discussed below  we have withdrawn iplex from the severe primary igf d market 
on march   we reached a settlement agreement ending all litigation with tercica and genentech 
pursuant to the agreement  we agreed to cease sales and marketing of iplex in the united states and agreed to withdraw our european marketing authorization application for iplex 
we will continue to provide iplex to named patients with als in italy under our expanded access program 
the agreement also gives us the right  through a worldwide development partnership with tercica and genentech  to market iplex for conditions not related to short stature 
these indications include mmd and hars  among others 
the development partnership includes provisions that give us a share of profits and reimbursement for of development costs if either tercica or genentech exercises opt in rights for marketing of iplex in any of these new indications that we develop 
in addition  as part of the settlement agreement  tercica and genentech waived the damages awarded by the jury in the patent infringement suit from the district court for the northern district of california 
as a result of our settlement agreement with tercica and genentech  we decided to restructure our business and refocus our efforts 
as part of our restructuring plan  our commercial operations unit will be eliminated and production at our manufacturing facility in boulder  colorado  will be scaled back  to reflect the reduced product requirement saving million in annualized commercial costs and million in annualized manufacturing costs 
in connection with this restructuring  our workforce was reduced by approximately 
we intend to refocus our business to capitalize on the therapeutic opportunities presented by our current product candidates by developing them for the treatment of metabolic diseases and endocrine disorders and oncology 
as a result of taking iplex off the market  we incurred an impairment charge of million in certain capital equipment and inventory which is reflected in our fiscal financial statements 
the total cost of the severance awards granted pursuant to the restructuring plan was approximately million and will be reflected in our financial results 
we have not been profitable and have accumulated deficits of approximately million through december  we expect to incur significant additional losses for at least the next several years until such time as sufficient revenues are generated to offset expenses 
moving forward our major source of income is expected to be the cost recovery charges for our expanded access program and our major expenses will be for research and development 
in general  our expenditures may increase as development of our product candidates progresses 
however  there will be fluctuations from period to period caused by differences in project costs incurred at each stage of development 
research and development activities we are engaged in the research and development of proposed drug products for the treatment of metabolic diseases and endocrine disorders 
all of our research and development expenditures  whether conducted by our own staff or by external scientists on our behalf and at our expense  are recorded as expenses as incurred and amounted to approximately million dollars for the period since inception  in november  through december   
table of contents and million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses  costs to develop and manufacture drug candidates  patent protection costs  and amounts paid to contract research organizations  hospitals and laboratories for the provision of services and materials for drug development and clinical trials 
substantially all of our research and development expenditures for each of fiscal and were related to iplex  as prior to our settlement agreement with tercica and genentech  we were in the process of commercializing iplex for the short stature disorders market 
our research and development efforts for other products are in their early stages and include primarily research and development regarding rhigfbp for the treatment of various cancers and insm for the treatment of various tumors 
these products are either in preclinical stages or  phase i and ii clinical trials 
all of our research and development expenditures related to these early stage products and our efforts associated with iplex are significantly interrelated as they are all associated with drugs that modulate igf i activity in the human body 
a significant finding in any one drug for a particular indication may provide benefits to our efforts across all of these products 
all of these products also share a substantial amount of our common fixed costs such as salaries  facility costs  utilities and maintenance 
given the small portion of research and development expenses that are related to products other than iplex we have determined that very limited benefits would be obtained from implementing cost tracking systems that would be necessary to allow for cost information on a product by product basis 
in the near term  we intend to focus substantially all of our research and development resources on the expansion of iplex into other indications 
our plans to expand iplex into additional indications are expected to represent our main research and development focus and expense in our thrust to develop our other early stage products will continue  but we expect those efforts to account for a much smaller portion of our research and development expenditures 
these estimates are based on currently available information and  due to a number of factors  no assurance can be provided that this project will not take longer to complete or cost more than we have currently estimated 
our clinical trials with our product candidates are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that are outside of our control  including the possibility that necessary regulatory approvals may not be obtained 
for example  the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during the clinical trial protocol  including  among others  the following the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trial  the duration of patient follow up that is determined to be appropriate in view of results  the number of clinical sites included in the trials  the length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects  and the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate 
our clinical trials may also be subject to delays or rejections based on our inability to enroll patients at the rate that we expect or our inability to produce clinical trial material in sufficient quantities and of sufficient quality to meet the schedule for our planned clinical trials 
moreover  all of our product candidates and particularly those that are in the preclinical or early clinical trial stage must overcome significant regulatory  technological  manufacturing and marketing challenges before they can be successfully commercialized 
some of these product candidates may never reach the clinical trial stage of research and development 
as preclinical studies and clinical trials progress  we may determine that collaborative relationships will be necessary to help us further develop or to commercialize our product candidates  but such relationships may be difficult or impossible to arrange 
our projects or intended projects may also be subject to change from time to time as we evaluate our research and development priorities and available resources 

table of contents any significant delays that occur or additional expenses that we incur may have a material adverse affect on our financial position and require us to raise additional capital sooner or in larger amounts than is presently expected 
in addition  as a result of the risks and uncertainties related to the development and approval of our product candidates and the additional uncertainties related to our ability to market and sell these products once approved for commercial sale  we are unable to provide a meaningful prediction regarding the period in which material net cash inflows from any of these projects is expected to become available 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  we recorded a net loss of million 
revenues for fiscal were million 
made up of million from commercial sales  million in cost recovery from our expanded access program and million in royalty 
for the same period in we reported million in royalty 
cost of goods sold for the fiscal was million  which represents both variable and fixed components of drug supply production costs 
these costs  which were previously expensed prior to commercial launch  were capitalized into inventory following launch and charged to the cost of product sales as units of iplex were sold 
the high cost of goods sold in fiscal was primarily driven by the large site fixed cost component being spread over a restricted commercial production as process enhancements required production downtime and also includes a lower of cost or market valuation adjustment of approximately million 
research and development expenses  which consist primarily of costs associated with clinical trials of our product candidates  including the costs of manufacturing  compensation and other expenses related to research and development personnel and facilities expenses  decreased million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this reduction in spending resulted primarily from recording litigation expenses in the selling  general and administrative category in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the increase was due to the commercial launch of iplex and the recordation of legal costs in selling  general and administrative 
following the agreement with tercica and genentech on march   approximately million in inventory and million in construction in progress was written off to asset impairment as a result of management s assessed fair value of these assets at december  we recorded million in interest expense for fiscal as a result of the amortization and conversion of our march  convertible notes 
of this amount million was non cash as a result of the accelerated amortization of the debt discount due to the conversion of notes to common stock in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal million of unamortized debt discount remained in long term liabilities on our balance sheet and is expected to be amortized over the remaining life of the notes 
as of december   cash and cash equivalents increased to million from million at december  as a result of a higher average cash balance and higher interest rates in fiscal compared to fiscal  interest income increased million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal accounts payable and accrued project costs and other increased million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a result of increased litigation activity 
stockholders equity increased million  mainly due to our common stock financing on march   in which we received net proceeds of million and the exercise of warrants during the year in which we received million 
this was offset by our net loss for of million 
the accumulated deficit at december   increased to approximately million due to our fiscal net loss of million 
fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  we recorded a net loss of million 
research and development expenses  which consist primarily of costs associated with clinical trials of our product candidates  including the costs of manufacturing  
table of contents compensation and other expenses related to research and development personnel and facilities expenses  decreased million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decrease in spending resulted from a winding down of our clinical trials program offset by an increase in our manufacturing activity 
general and administrative expenses increased million  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the increase was due to higher external service and personnel costs in support of our business 
revenues decreased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  due to a slight decline in royalties for tgf beta 
we recorded million in interest expense for fiscal  as a result of our march  convertible notes financing 
of this amount million was non cash as a result of the accelerated amortization of the debt discount due to the conversion of notes to common stock in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal million of unamortized debt discount remained in long term liabilities on our balance sheet and is expected to be amortized over the remaining life of the notes 
in fiscal  cash and cash equivalents increased to million from million at december  as a result of a higher average cash balance and higher interest rates in compared to  interest income increased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal accounts payable and accrued project costs and other decreased million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  as a result of decreased clinical and manufacturing activity 
stockholders equity increased million  mainly as a result of our convertible notes financing on march   in which we received net proceeds of million 
this was offset by the net loss for fiscal year of million 
the accumulated deficit at the end of fiscal increased to approximately million  due to our fiscal net loss of million 
liquidity and capital resources there is considerable time and cost associated with developing a potential drug or pharmaceutical product to the point where fda approval for sales is received 
in our financial management  we seek to raise the funds necessary for such development primarily through the issuance of equity securities in private placement transactions 
however  it is our intention to pursue additional financing options  including entering into agreements with corporate partners in order to provide milestone payments  license fees and equity investments 
capital requirements capital expenditures in fiscal  were principally related to the research and development  clinical trial activity  legal defense  sales and marketing and manufacturing activities at our site in boulder  colorado  as well as administrative support activities 
in the short term  we will need to raise substantial additional funds to expand iplex into other indications 
in the longer term  we will require substantial additional funds for the continued development of our other lead product candidates 
we have filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission that allows us to sell up to  of our common stock  preferred stock or warrants for common or preferred stock of which million is still available on the shelf 
we may sell these securities in one or more separate offerings in amounts  at prices and on terms to be determined at the time of such offer or offerings 
this shelf registration statement is intended to give us flexibility to take advantage of financing opportunities when and if deemed appropriate by us 
our continuation as a going concern depends on our ability to obtain such additional financing and  ultimately  to generate positive cash flow and attain profitability 
there can be no assurance that adequate funds will be available when we need them or on favorable terms 
if at any time we are unable to obtain sufficient additional funds  we will be required to delay  restrict or eliminate some or all of our research or development programs  dispose of assets or technology or cease operations 
the report of the independent registered public accounting firm to our audited financial statements for the period ended december   indicates that there are a number of factors that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
such factors identified in the report are our net loss position  our failure to attain positive cash flows from operations and our dependence upon obtaining adequate financing 

table of contents planned expenditures in include the funding of our ongoing research and development activity  such as manufacturing and clinical trial costs  and general and administrative support costs 
capital resources we have funded our operations to date primarily through public and private placements of debt and equity securities 
we plan to continue incurring losses as we expand our research and development and do not expect material revenues for at least the next several years 
at december   our cash and cash investments were approximately million  and were invested in money market instruments 
the increase in our cash on hand of million from the level at december  is due to million in net cash received from financing activities which was partially offset by a total of million used in operating and investing activities 
on march   we entered into an underwriting agreement the underwriting agreement with lazard capital markets llc  as representative of the underwriters together  the underwriters  relating to the public offering  issuance and sale of  shares of our common stock  par value per share 
the price to the public was per share  and the underwriters purchased the shares from the us pursuant to the underwriting agreement at a price of per share 
the offering was made pursuant to the our effective shelf registration statement 
our business strategy contemplates raising additional capital through equity sales 
we also plan to enter into agreements with corporate partners in order to fund research and development and to provide milestone payments  license fees and equity investments to fund our operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that we believe is material to investors 
contractual obligations we are obligated to make future payments under various contracts as set forth below contractual obligations in thousands payments due by years total beyond long term debt operating lease obligations long term debt obligations reflect the future interest and principal payments of the future interest and principal payments of the company s convertible notes outstanding as of december  these notes become due in quarterly installments  beginning on march   if not converted to common shares at an earlier date 

table of contents critical accounting policies preparation of financial statements in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we use our historical experience and other relevant factors when developing our estimates and assumptions 
we continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions 
the accounting policies discussed below are those we consider critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
for additional accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements description of the business and summary of significant accounting policies 
research and development research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses  cost to develop and manufacture products  patent protection costs  and amounts paid to contract research organizations  hospitals and laboratories for the provision of services and materials for drug development and clinical trials 
we do not have separate accounting policies for internal or external research and development and we do not conduct any research and development for others 
our expenses related to clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with third party organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
these contracts set forth the scope of work to be completed at a fixed fee or amount per patient enrolled 
payments under these contracts depend on performance criteria such as the successful enrollment of patients or the completion of clinical trial milestones 
expenses are accrued based on contracted amounts applied to the level of patient enrollment and to activity according to the clinical trial protocol 
litigation costs as it relates to our patents were recorded as research and development expenditures through the first quarter of fiscal however  since may when we shifted from research and development operations to commercial operations  litigation costs were recorded as a selling  general and administrative activity 
revenue recognition we record revenue from product sales when the goods are delivered and title passes to the customer 
at the time of sale  estimates for sales deductions  including rebates to government agencies  are recorded 
these provisions are provided for in the same period the related product sales are recorded 
we began generating revenue from the sale of iplex  in may on may  we announced the iplex utilization program which informed the payer universe that the annual charge for therapy is limited to actual milligrams prescribed and used 
the utilization program assures that there is no charge for unused product remaining after the prescribed dose is extracted 
any remaining product discarded as waste is accounted for when all the vials in a vial pack are used  and any wastage is replaced by us at no charge to the payer or patient  to assure that the payer or patient pays only for the amount dosed and administered 
revenues from iplex are expected to cease by the end of march as a result of our settlement agreement with genentech and tercica 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  shared based payment 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by the black scholes merton bsm option pricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
the bsm model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the bsm model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest excess cash in investment grade  interest bearing securities and  at december   had million invested in money market instruments 
such investments are subject to interest rate and credit risk 
our policy of investing in highly rated securities whose maturities at december   are all less than six months minimizes such risks 
in addition  while a hypothetical one percent per annum decrease in market interest rates would reduce interest income in  it would not result in a loss of the principal and the decline in interest income would be deemed immaterial 
our purpose in making these investments is to generate investment income 
we currently do not transact any significant portion of our business in currencies other than the united states dollar 
to the extent that we continue to transact our business in united states dollars  we do not believe that the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations
