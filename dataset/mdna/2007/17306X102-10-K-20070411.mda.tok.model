item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section entitled selected financial and operating data and our audited financial statements and the respective related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
as a result of many factors  such as those set forth under the section entitled risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
overview we are a rapidly growing  value priced retailer of urban fashion apparel and accessories for the entire family 
our merchandise offerings are designed to appeal to the preferences of fashion conscious consumers  particularly african americans 
originally our stores were located in the southeast  and in recent years we expanded into the mid atlantic and midwest regions and texas 
we operate stores in both urban and rural markets in states 
we are pursuing an aggressive store growth strategy and believe that the addition of new stores will be the primary source of future growth 
in fiscal we opened stores 
during this period  we entered the indianapolis  indiana  dayton  ohio and st louis  missouri markets 
we expect to open to new stores in fiscal approximately of the new stores we intend to open in fiscal will be located in states that we currently serve 
we measure performance using key operating statistics 
one of the main performance measures is comparable store sales growth 
we define a comparable store as a store that has been opened for an entire fiscal year 
therefore  a store will not be considered a comparable store until its th month of operation at the earliest or until its th month at the latest 
as an example  stores opened in fiscal and fiscal were not considered comparable stores in fiscal relocated and expanded stores are included in the comparable store sales results 
we also use other operating statistics  most notably average sales per store  to measure our performance 
as we typically occupy existing space in established shopping centers rather than sites built specifically for our stores  store square footage and therefore sales per square foot varies by store 
we focus on overall store sales volume as the critical driver of profitability 
the average sales per store has increased over the past three years as we have increased comparable store sales and opened new stores that are generally larger than our historical store base 
average sales per store have increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal in addition to sales  we measure gross profit as a percent of sales and store operating expenses  with a particular focus on labor as a percentage of sales 
these results translate into store level contribution  which we use to evaluate overall performance of each individual store 
finally  we monitor corporate expenses against budgeted amounts 
secondary offering on january   we completed a secondary offering of shares of our common stock by certain of our stockholders that was priced at per share 
the offering consisted of  shares of common stock  including  shares that were subject to the underwriters over allotment option 
all of the shares were sold by our stockholders and  as a result  we did not receive any of the proceeds from the offering 
in connection with the offering certain of our stockholders exercised options which were then sold in the offering for which we received approximately  we incurred expenses in fiscal in connection with the secondary offering of approximately  subsequent event on april   we filed a shelf registration statement on form s to cover the offer and sale  from time to time  of up to  shares of our common stock  by hampshire equity partners ii  lp and its affiliates and up to an additional  shares of our common stock by other possible selling stockholders consisting of certain of our officers and directors 
the registration statement was filed pursuant to the terms of a registration rights agreement between hampshire equity partners ii  lp and us 
the selling stockholders may sell any  all or none of their respective shares of our common stock to be registered from time to time in one or more transactions 
we will not receive any proceeds from the sale of these shares 
basis of the presentation net sales consist of store sales  net of returns by customers and layaway fees 
cost of sales consists of the cost of products we sell and associated freight costs 
selling  general and administrative expense is comprised of store costs  including salaries and store occupancy costs  handling costs  corporate and distribution center costs and advertising costs 
we operate on a or week fiscal year  which ends on the saturday closest to january each of our fiscal quarters consists of four week periods  with an extra week added on to the fourth quarter every five to six years 
the years ended february   january   january   january  and february  are referred to as fiscal    and  respectively 
fiscal year is comprised of weeks 
fiscal years   and are each comprised of weeks 
results of operations the following discussion of our financial performance is based on the condensed financial statements set forth in the financial pages of this report 
the nature of our business is seasonal 
historically  sales in the first and fourth quarters have been higher than sales achieved in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year 
expenses  and to a greater extent operating income  vary by quarter 
results of a period shorter than a full year may not be indicative of results expected for the entire year 
furthermore  the seasonal nature of our business may affect comparisons between periods 
net sales and additional operating data the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  selected statement of income data expressed both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales fiscal year ended february  january  january  dollars in thousands statement of income data net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest expense income income before income taxes income tax expense net income the following table provides information  for the periods indicated  about the number of total stores open at the beginning of the period  stores opened and closed during each period  total stores open at the end of each period and comparable store sales for the periods fiscal year ended february  january  january  total stores open  beginning of period new stores closed stores total stores open  end of period comparable store sales increase stores closed for one or more days due to hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma are not included in this number 
the number of stores open at the end of the period includes one store closed as of january   as a result of hurricane wilma  which reopened in april stores included in the comparable store sales calculation for any period are those stores that were opened prior to the beginning of the preceding fiscal year and were still open at the end of such period 
relocated stores and expanded stores are included in the comparable store sales results 
the company is reporting comparable store sales on a comparable store and comparable week basis  the weeks ended february  are compared to the weeks ended february  fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in net sales was primarily due to new store openings in fiscal and a comparable store sales increase of note is based on a week fiscal compared to the comparable weeks in the prior year for fiscal compared to fiscal the stores opened in fiscal accounted for million of the total increase in sales  the stores opened in fiscal accounted for million and the comparable stores contributed million of the increase in sales 
these sales increases were offset by million due to one store that was closed in fiscal sales in the rd week of fiscal ending february  were million 
seven stores were expanded and or relocated in fiscal the increase in comparable store sales was from a higher average item price and an increase in customer transactions  which was due in part to increasing consumer preference for branded goods 
in fiscal  we believe comparable store sales increases should moderate into the low single digits 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in gross profit is primarily a result of our strong sales increases 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit was in fiscal compared to in fiscal although the gross profit as a percentage of sales did not change  markdown rates were higher as a percent of sales in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was offset by a higher initial mark up on merchandise 
excluding the effect of the rd week  gross profit as a percentage of sales would have been in fiscal compared to in fiscal this deleveraging was primarily due to higher markdowns on lower comparable sales increases in fiscal selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in these expenses was due primarily to additional store level  distribution and corporate costs arising from the opening of new stores in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily due in part to the payment in fiscal of a million fee to terminate the consulting agreement with hampshire equity partners ii  lp formerly majority stockholder  property losses in fiscal from hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma of approximately  and expenses of approximately  in fiscal related to our secondary offering  which was consummated on january  partially offsetting these favorable items were additional costs incurred by the company for compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act and increased insurance cost for property and medical coverage in fiscal  all of which totaled approximately million 
excluding revenues and costs incremental to the rd week  selling general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales would have been basis points higher or in fiscal interest income 
interest income increased million  or to million for fiscal from approximately  in fiscal the increase in interest income was due to the full year impact of interest income earned on proceeds from our initial public offering 
interest expense 
interest expense increased approximately  or to approximately  in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal the increase in interest expense was primarily due to the addition of a million equipment lease in fiscal provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased million  or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the effective income tax rates for fiscal and fiscal were and  respectively 
the tax rate decreased in fiscal primarily as a result of our investment in tax exempt securities and an increase in job tax credits 
we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately in fiscal  primarily due to projected increase in our pre tax income 
net income 
net income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in net income was due to the factors discussed above 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in net sales was primarily due to new store openings in fiscal and a comparable store sales increase of for fiscal compared to fiscal this increase reflects in part the positive impact of increased sales during the months of september through january following hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma  in stores in the affected region 
the stores opened in fiscal accounted for million of the total increase in sales  the stores opened in fiscal accounted for million and the comparable stores contributed million of the increase in sales 
four stores were expanded and or relocated in fiscal the increase in comparable store sales was primarily from an increase in customer transactions and from the increasing consumer preference for branded goods 
comparable store sales for fiscal also were positively impacted by post hurricane sales during the months of september through january federal emergency management act vouchers and other one time assistance enabled many of our customers to purchase apparel and other items to replace what had been lost from the hurricanes 
while the hurricanes had a negative effect on us by causing stores to be closed for one day or more during the third quarter of fiscal  the subsequent sales increases after the stores reopened more than offset the sales missed on those lost days 
stores located in areas contiguous to the stores affected directly by the hurricanes also showed a dramatic increase in their sales for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in gross profit is primarily a result of our strong sales increases 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased to in fiscal from in fiscal this increase  as a percentage of net sales  was primarily due to reduced markdown rates which was a result of well balanced inventories and strong sales increases in fiscal compared to fiscal selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in these expenses was due primarily to additional store level  distribution and corporate costs arising from the opening of new stores in fiscal  the payment of a million fee to terminate the consulting agreement with hampshire equity partners ii  lp  property losses from hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma  which totaled approximately  in fiscal and expenses of approximately  related to our secondary offering  which was consummated on january  selling  general and administrative expenses increased additionally due to costs associated with being a public company of approximately  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to our strong comparable store sales growth and our ability to leverage sg a costs 
in addition  this decrease is in part due to a prior year charge in fiscal of approximately  for additional vacation pay accrual pursuant to a change in our vacation policy 
interest income 
interest income increased to approximately  in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal the increase in interest income was due primarily to interest income earned on proceeds from our initial public offering 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to approximately  in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the redemption of shares of our preferred stock subject to mandatory redemption in may  the absence of any borrowings under our previous line of credit and the repaying in full of our mortgage on our fahm street headquarters and distribution center 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased to approximately million in fiscal from million in fiscal the effective income tax rates for fiscal and fiscal were and  respectively 
the tax rate decreased in fiscal as a result of our investment in tax exempt securities  an increase in job tax credits and a reduction in non deductible dividends on our preferred stock subject to mandatory redemption 
we expect our tax rate to be approximately in fiscal  primarily due to additional anticipated job tax credits in fiscal and the full year impact of our investment in tax exempt securities 
net income 
net income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in net income was due to the factors discussed above 
quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly results of operations for fiscal and fiscal each quarterly period presented below consists of weeks except for the quarterly period ended february  which contains weeks  and the information includes our statement of income data for each such period and additional operating data for each such period 
in the opinion of management  these unaudited interim financial data have been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements and reflect all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments and fairly present the financial information disclosed for these periods 
the interim financial data set forth below should be read in conjunction with  and are qualified in their entirety by reference to  the audited financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
the results of operations for historical periods are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
due to the importance of the spring selling season  which includes easter  and the fall selling season  which includes christmas  net sales and earnings are disproportionately higher during the first and fourth fiscal quarters each year  and we expect these quarters will continue to provided a disproportionate contribution to the profitability for the entire fiscal year 
as a result  any factors negatively affecting us in any year during the first and fourth fiscal quarters  including adverse weather and unfavorable economic conditions  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations for the entire year 
our quarterly results of operations also may fluctuate based upon such factors as the timing of holiday seasons  the number and timing of new store openings  the amount of store preopening expenses  the amount of net sales contributed by new and existing stores  the mix of products sold  the timing and level of markdowns  store closings  remodels and relocations  competitive factors  the weather and general economic conditions

liquidity and capital resources our cash requirements are primarily for working capital  expansion of our darlington distribution center  construction of new stores  remodeling of our existing stores and the improvement of our information systems 
historically  we have met these cash requirements from cash flow from operations  short term trade credit  borrowings under our revolving lines of credit  long term debt and capital leases and cash proceeds from our initial public offering 
we expect to be able to meet future cash requirements with cash flow from operations and existing cash balances 
on may   we completed our initial public offering of our common stock  as a result of which we issued and sold  shares of common stock at per share 
in addition  the underwriters exercised the over allotment option  pursuant to which we issued and sold an additional  shares on june  we received aggregate gross proceeds of approximately million and incurred approximately million in expenses in connection with our initial public offering resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
in addition   shares of common stock were sold in our initial public offering by certain selling stockholders  for which we received no proceeds 
as a result  upon the closing of the offering  there were  shares of our common stock outstanding 
following the closing of our initial public offering on may   all of our  shares of preferred stock subject to mandatory redemption were redeemed and extinguished for approximately million  and we repaid in full our mortgage on the fahm street headquarters and distribution center in the amount of approximately million 
using a portion of the proceeds from our initial public offering and cash flow from operations  we purchased a distribution center in darlington  south carolina in fiscal discussion of cash flows fiscal compared to fiscal at february   we had total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million compared with total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million at january  the most significant factors in the change in our net liquidity position during fiscal were the positive cash flow from operations and financing activities provided by tax benefits realized by the exercise of stock options  offset by capital expenditures to open new stores and the repayment of debt 
inventory represented approximately of our total assets as of february  management s ability to manage our inventory can have a significant impact on our cash flows from operations during a given interim period or fiscal year 
in addition  inventory purchases can be seasonal in nature  such as the purchase of warm weather or christmas related merchandise 
cash flows provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the main sources of cash provided during fiscal were net income adjusted for depreciation and other non cash charges of million  increases in accrued expenses of million and an increase in accrued compensation of million 
uses of cash consisted of a million increase in inventory net of accounts payable and a million increase in prepaid assets 
cash flows used in investing activities 
cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal net cash used for the purchase of property and equipment increased during fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to capital expenditures in the amount of million in fiscal for the purchase of property and equipment for the build out of new stores  six relocations and remodels  purchase of markdown scanners  build out of a distribution center in darlington and other general corporate purposes compared to million in fiscal used for the purchase of property and equipment for the build out of new stores  four relocations and remodels  purchase of our distribution center in darlington and other general corporate purposes 
excluding equipment financed by capital leases  the net amount of cash spent on purchases of property and equipment was million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
approximately million of our capital expenditures for new stores in fiscal was reimbursed to us by the landlords of our leased properties 
these tenant improvement dollars will be amortized over the life of the individual store s lease as a reduction to occupancy expense 
other uses of cash for investment activities in fiscal included investment activities in marketable securities consisting of net investment of million of cash in municipal auction rate securities 
cash flows provided used by financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal and million in fiscal financing activities in fiscal included the tax benefit from stock exercises of million  the net receipt of approximately  from options exercised during our secondary offering and employee stock option exercises that occurred in fiscal and debt repayments of approximately  on our capital leases 
until required for other purposes  we maintain cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in deposit accounts or highly liquid investments 
fiscal compared to fiscal at january   we had total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million compared with total cash and cash equivalents of million at january  the most significant factors in the change in our net liquidity position during fiscal were the proceeds from our initial public offering  positive cash flow from operations  offset by capital expenditures to open new stores and purchase the distribution center in darlington  south carolina  the repayment of debt and the redemption of our preferred stock 
inventory represented approximately of our total assets as of january  management s ability to manage our inventory can have a significant impact on our cash flows from operations during a given interim period or fiscal year 
in addition  inventory purchases can be seasonal in nature  such as the purchase of warm weather or christmas related merchandise

cash flows used in investing activities 
cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal net cash used in investing activities increased during fiscal compared to fiscal primarily because of the investment of million of cash proceeds from the ipo in municipal auction rate securities 
we also made capital expenditures in the amount of million in fiscal for the purchase of property and equipment for the build out of new stores  four relocations and remodels  a distribution center in darlington and other general corporate purposes compared to million in fiscal used for the purchase of property and equipment for the build out of new stores  one relocation and other general corporate purposes

liquidity sources  requirements and contractual cash requirements and commitments our principal sources of liquidity consist of i cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities which equaled million as of february   ii trade credit  iii cash generated from operations on an ongoing basis as we sell our merchandise inventory  and iv an unsecured line of credit with a maximum available borrowing of million subject to our inventory levels with million available and none drawn down as of february  
short term trade credit represents a significant source of financing for inventory purchases 
trade credit arises from customary payment terms and trade practices with our vendors 
historically  our principal liquidity requirements have been to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs 
we believe that our existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations and anticipated capital expenditures for at least the next months 
we cannot be certain that additional capital or other sources of liquidity will be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
during fiscal and prior years  we had a million line of credit that expired on april  we did not draw against the line of credit since our initial public offering and believe current sources of liquidity to be sufficient for cash requirements over the next months  therefore we did not renew the million line of credit when it expired on april  we anticipate that capital expenditures will be approximately million to million for fiscal these expenditures will relate to the purchase of property and equipment for the to stores we plan to open in fiscal  the addition of more office space and the planned addition to our darlington distribution center 
we plan to finance these capital expenditures with cash flow from operations and existing cash balances 
the following table discloses aggregate information about our contractual obligations as of february  and the periods in which payments are due payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands contractual obligations capital leases operating leases purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations represents fixed minimum rentals in stores and does not include incremental rents which are computed as a percentage of net sales 
for example  in fiscal incremental percentage rent was approximately million  which represented of total rent expense 
indebtedness 
we had a revolving line of credit secured by substantially all of our assets pursuant to which we paid customary fees 
this secured line of credit expired on april  the company does not intend to renew this line of credit 
this secured line of credit provided for aggregate cash borrowings and the issuance of letters of credit up to the lesser of million or the borrowing base which was approximately million at february   with a letter of credit sub limit of million 
borrowings under this secured line of credit bore interest at the prime rate plus a spread or libor plus a spread  at our election  based on conditions in the credit agreement 
as of february   we had no outstanding borrowings on the line of credit  and no outstanding letters of credit 
under the terms of the credit agreement  we were required to maintain a minimum tangible net worth 
in september  we entered into an annual unsecured revolving line of credit with bank of america  na  which was renewed in june the line of credit provides for aggregate cash borrowings up to million to be used for general operating purposes 
borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at libor plus a spread 
at february   there was no balance on this revolving line of credit 
we may borrow funds under the line of credit with bank of america from time to time and subsequently repay such borrowings with available cash generated from operations 
capital leases 
we have capital lease obligations that financed the purchase of computer equipment 
as of february   our capital lease obligations were million 
these obligations have maturity dates ranging from may to december the interest rates on these obligations range from to 
all of these obligations are secured by the computer equipment 
the lease agreements contain cross default provisions which result in a default if the company is out of compliance with any other borrowing agreements 
operating leases 
we lease our stores under operating leases  which generally have an initial term of five years with one five year renewal option 
the typical store lease requires a combination of both fixed monthly rentals and rentals computed as percentage of net sales after a certain sales threshold has been met 
included in our operating lease contractual obligations is the minimum monthly rental payments for our coleman boulevard distribution center in savannah  as well as the los angeles and new york city buyers offices 
for fiscal  rental expense was million compared to million for fiscal including approximately million and million of percentage rent  respectively  in fiscal and 
purchase obligations 
as of february   we had purchase obligations of million  all of which were for less than one year 
these purchase obligations primarily consist of outstanding merchandise orders 
off balance sheet arrangements other than the store and support center operating leases described above  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
outstanding stock options as of february   we had outstanding vested options to purchase  shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share  and outstanding unvested options to purchase  shares of common stock at a weighted average price of per share 
the per share value of each share of common stock underlying the vested and unvested options  based on the difference between the exercise price per option and the estimated fair market value of the shares at the dates of the grant of the options also referred to as intrinsic value  ranges from to per share 
based on the closing price of our common stock of per share on february   the intrinsic value of the options outstanding on february  was million  of which million related to vested options and million related to unvested options 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements revenue recognition while the recognition of revenue is predominantly derived from routine retail transactions and does not involve significant judgment  revenue recognition represents an important accounting policy of ours 
we recognize retail sales net of sales taxes at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise and purchases are paid for less an allowance for returns 
we allow for returns up to ten days after the date of sales and the estimate for returns is based on actual observed return activity ten days after the period ends 
revenue from layaway sales is recognized when the customer has paid for and received the merchandise 
program service charges  which are non refundable  are recognized in revenue when collected 
all sales are from cash  check or major credit card company transactions 
inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost first in  first out basis or market as determined by the retail inventory method less a provision for estimated inventory shrinkage 
under the retail inventory method  the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a cost to retail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory 
inherent in the retail inventory calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates  including  among others  merchandise markups  markdowns and shrinkage  which impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as resulting gross margins 
we estimate shrinkage for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date 
the estimate for the shrinkage reserve can be affected by changes in actual shrinkage trends 
we believe the first in  first out retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that is fairly stated 
many retailers have arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances under certain conditions  which ultimately affect the value of the inventory 
we do not generally enter into such arrangements with our vendors 
property and equipment  net we have a significant investment in property and equipment 
property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
equipment under capital leases is stated at the present value of minimum lease payments 
depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight line method over the lesser of the estimated useful lives primarily three to five years for computer equipment and furniture  fixtures and equipment  five years for leasehold improvements and fifteen years for buildings of the related assets or the relevant lease term  whichever is shorter 
any reduction in these estimated useful lives would result in a higher annual depreciation expense for the related assets 
impairment of long lived assets we continually evaluate whether events and changes in circumstances warrant revised estimates of the useful lives or recognition of an impairment loss for long lived assets 
future adverse changes in market and legal conditions  or poor operating results of underlying assets could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the long lived asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
if facts and circumstances indicate that a long lived asset  including property and equipment  may be impaired  the carrying value is reviewed 
if this review indicates that the carrying value of the asset will not be recovered as determined based on projected undiscounted cash flows related to the asset over its remaining life  the carrying value of the asset is reduced to its estimated fair value 
impairment losses in the future are dependent on a number of factors such as site selection and general economic trends  and thus could be significantly different from historical results 
to the extent our estimates for net sales  gross profit and store expenses are not realized  future assessments of recoverability could result in impairment charges 
stock based compensation we adopted sfas no 
revised share based payment sfas no 
r during the first quarter of fiscal sfas no 
r requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based awards made to employees based on estimated fair value of the award 
the determination of the fair value of our stock options on the date of grant using an option price model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
the fair values of options and shares issued pursuant to the stock based compensation plans at each grant date were estimated using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas no 
r in future periods  the compensation expense recorded under sfas no 
r may differ significantly from the amount recorded in the current period 
operating leases we lease all of our store properties and one of our distribution centers and account for the leases as operating leases in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
many lease agreements contain tenant improvement allowances  rent holidays  rent escalation clauses and or contingent rent provisions 
for purposes of recognizing incentives and minimum rental expenses on a straight line basis over the terms of the leases  we use the date of initial possession to begin amortization  which is generally when we enter the space and begin to make improvements in preparation of intended use 
for scheduled rent escalation clauses during the lease terms or for rental payments commencing rent holidays at a date other than the date of initial occupancy  we record minimum rental expenses on a straight line basis over the terms of the leases 
for tenant improvement allowances we record a deferred rent liability on the balance sheets and amortize the deferred rent over the terms of the leases 
certain leases provide for contingent rents that are not measurable at inception 
these contingent rents are primarily based on a percentage of sales that are in excess of a predetermined level 
these amounts are excluded from minimum rent and are included in the determination of total rent expense when it is probable that the expense has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the computation of income taxes is subject to estimation due to the judgment required and the uncertainty related to the recoverability of deferred tax assets or the outcome of tax audits 
we adjust our income tax provision in the period it is determined that actual results will differ from its estimates 
tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the year in which such changes are enacted 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all our accounting policies 
in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by us generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the sec released staff accounting bulletin sab  providing interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
based on this guidance  the sec staff believes that registrants should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and an income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
the implementation of sab did not have a material impact on our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
in june  the emerging issues task force eitf ratified eitf issue  how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation 
a consensus was reached that entities may adopt a policy of presenting taxes in the income statement on either a gross or net basis 
an entity should disclose its policy of presenting taxes and the amount of any taxes presented on a gross basis should be disclosed  if significant 
the guidance is effective for periods beginning after december  we present sales net of sales taxes 
eitf will not impact the method for recording these sales taxes in our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
does not require any new fair value measurements  rather  it applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
the provisions of sfas no 
are to be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which it is initially applied  with any transition adjustment recognized as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the standard  but do not expect it to have a material impact on our financial statements upon adoption 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertain tax positions  as defined therein 
fin seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for income taxes 
the provisions of fin are effective for us as of february   with any cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin on our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks related to changes in interest rates connected with our revolving lines of credit  which bear interest at variable rates 
we cannot predict market fluctuations in interest rates 
as a result  future results may differ materially from estimated results due to adverse changes in interest rates or debt availability 
a hypothetical basis point increase in prevailing market interest rates would not have materially impacted our financial position  results of operations or cash flows for fiscal we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes  and have not entered into any interest rate hedging contracts 
we source all of our product from apparel markets in the united states in us dollars and  therefore  are not subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we have not entered into forward contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices 
in june we began investing excess cash in auction rate securities 
these securities are highly liquid  variable rate debt securities 
while the underlying security has a long term nominal maturity  the interest rate is reset through dutch auctions that are typically held every days  creating a short term instrument 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe that we do not have material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investments as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  will reduce future investment income 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes
