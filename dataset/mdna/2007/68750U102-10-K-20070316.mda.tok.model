general development of our business we are a spine and orthopedic biosurgery company with proprietary biomaterials and biologic technologies for the development and commercialization of synthetic  biologically active  tissue engineering products 
we develop and market synthetic based biomaterial products for use in spine surgery  the repair of fractures and a broad range of clinical needs in the trauma  joint reconstruction  revision and extremities markets 
we also market products which complement our biomaterials platforms 
our near term commercial business is based on our vitoss bone graft substitute technology platforms  which are designed to address the non structural bone graft market by offering synthetic alternatives to the use of autograft or cadaver based bone material  and vitagel surgical hemostat  which is an adherent matrix and an impermeable barrier to blood flow 
our longer term us clinical development program is focused on our internally developed cortoss bone augmentation material technology platform  which is primarily designed for injections into osteoporotic spines to treat vertebral compression fractures vcfs 
in addition  we employ in house research and development in support of biomaterial and biologic technology platforms 
we also work jointly with kensey nash corporation kensey to develop and commercialize synthetic based biomaterial products  and we market vitagel under a license granted by angiotech pharmaceuticals us  inc collectively with its affiliates and parent company angiotech pharmaceuticals  inc  which is a shareholder of the company  angiotech  and we continue to pursue similar relationships with other biomaterials companies 
we incorporated in pennsylvania in and maintain a branch operation in belgium  as well as wholly owned subsidiaries incorporated in delaware to hold our intangible properties and certain cash funds 
kensey agreement in march  we entered into an agreement with kensey to jointly develop and commercialize certain biomaterials based products based upon our vitoss platform 
the new products to be developed under this agreement are based on our internally developed  proprietary vitoss bone 
table of contents void filler material in combination with proprietary resorbable kensey biomaterials 
kensey has the exclusive right to manufacture any approved or cleared jointly developed product under the agreement  and we will market and sell the product worldwide 
this right extends until february for the vitoss foam product platform 
following the regulatory approval or clearance of each new product under the agreement  we have obligations to pay kensey for manufacturing the product and make royalty payments to kensey based on the net sales of such product 
in december  we received k clearance from the us food and drug administration fda for the first jointly developed product platform  vitoss foam  and we commenced sales on the first of several product configurations under the vitoss foam product platform during february angiotech agreements in june  we entered into a distribution agreement with angiotech to distribute to surgical customers throughout north america the costasis composite liquid hemostat which we re branded as vitagel surgical hemostat and the cellpaker plasma collection system used in conjunction with vitagel 
the distribution agreement required us to purchase the products and make royalty payments to angiotech based on the net sales of such products 
effective september   the distribution agreement was amended to provide for the transition of product and accessory manufacturing responsibility from angiotech to us 
the amendment also changed the royalty rate payable by us to angiotech and modified the method for calculating net sales of such products 
angiotech decided to cease the manufacture of vitagel and cellpaker by november  therefore  in october  we purchased all available existing vitagel and cellpaker products  accessories and work in process from angiotech for  on june   we obtained pre market approval pma from the fda to sell vitagel manufactured at our malvern  pennsylvania facility the vitagel pma 
after receiving the vitagel pma  we started manufacturing vitagel in july  and in august we commenced selling vitagel first manufactured since obtaining the vitagel pma 
in addition  we had previously manufactured under the vitagel pma three lots of vitagel that became available for sale in late june in january  we obtained approval from the fda for a pma supplement which enables us to sell cellpaker manufactured by our subcontractor s facility 
effective january   we entered into a license agreement with angiotech pursuant to which angiotech licensed vitagel products and the cellpaker plasma collection system to us and we assumed manufacturing responsibility for these products 
the distribution agreement described above served as the basis for the establishment of the license agreement 
in accordance with its terms  the distribution agreement terminated in the first quarter of upon completion of the sale of all vitagel and cellpaker inventory products that we purchased from angiotech in october until december   we paid royalties on sales of the vitagel and cellpaker inventory that we purchased from angiotech in october in accordance with the terms of the distribution agreement 
on december   pursuant to a royalty sale agreement with angiotech  we purchased the profit sharing royalty rights for vitagel and cellpaker products under the license agreement for  in cash 
we anticipate recording an annual non cash expense of at least  in and in each year thereafter through july  for amortization of the 
table of contents  royalty prepayment 
concurrently with such purchase  we entered into an amended and restated license agreement with angiotech that amended the original license agreement to eliminate our obligations to meet minimum sales requirements  extend the term of the license from december  through july   and eliminate certain termination rights in favor of angiotech 
under the amended and restated license agreement  we have exclusive rights to manufacture and sell vitagel products throughout the world for orthopedic indications  and non exclusive rights to manufacture and sell cellpaker products throughout the world for all indications 
under the amended and restated license agreement  angiotech has an option for co exclusive rights outside the orthopedic field which  if exercised  would permit angiotech to manufacture and sell an angiotech branded vitagel product throughout the world 
until angiotech elects to exercise its option for co exclusive rights  we have exclusive rights to manufacture and sell vitagel outside of the orthopedic field throughout the world 
if angiotech elects to exercise its option  we would then have co exclusive rights to manufacture and sell vitagel outside of the orthopedic field throughout the world 
prior to the amendment and restatement of the license agreement on december   we were required to make royalty payments thereunder based on a share of all revenue we received from net sales of vitagel and cellpaker products that we manufactured 
biomimetic agreement in august  we entered into a supply agreement with biomimetic pharmaceutical inc biomimetic that enables biomimetic to use its recombinant human platelet derived growth factor rhpdgf in combination with our proprietary vitomatrix particulate synthetic scaffold biomaterial  which we produce in the same process used to manufacture vitoss 
under the agreement  we supply our proprietary beta tricalcium phosphate biomaterial to biomimetic for its clinical and commercial use in conjunction with its rhpdgf 
the agreement provides that biomimetic may market and sell the combined product in the dental  periodontal  oral and cranio maxillofacial bone grafting markets 
other sales and corporate information we market and sell our vitoss products  the imbibe bone marrow aspiration and delivery devices used with vitoss and vitagel and cellpaker products through a us field sales network of direct sales representatives and independent sales agencies that we began to assemble in june as of december   we had approximately direct sales representatives and arrangements with approximately independent sales agencies that we utilize to market our products 
we continue to strengthen our field sales network through the addition of direct sales representatives in those us sales territories where either we do not have independent sales agency coverage or the territories are underserved 
outside of the us  we primarily utilize a network of independent stocking distributors to market vitoss  cortoss and the aliquot delivery system a system designed to facilitate effective delivery of our cortoss product

table of contents vitoss bone graft substitute vitoss blocks and morsels approved in european union in july fda k cleared december vitoss micro and macro morsels fda k cleared december vitoss standard and micro canisters fda k cleared november vitoss foam product platform  including fda k cleared december vitoss foam strips and cylinders vitoss foam flow vitoss foam shapes vitoss foam pack vitoss is an ultra porous resorbable beta tricalcium phosphate bone void filler used to help the body guide the three dimensional regeneration of the patient s own bone 
we launched vitoss in the us and the eu in and have sold over  units through december  vitoss s ultra porosity allows it to soak and hold its own volume in blood and bone marrow aspirate and has been shown to perform well in an array of applications in the spine  extremities and pelvis  such as spinal grafting and the treatment of bone defects due to trauma  degenerative disease and tumors 
vitoss integrates well into existing bone and allows for bone in growth and maturation 
vitoss and the vitoss foam products are covered by issued and pending us and foreign patents 
since the initial us regulatory clearance and subsequent product launch in mid  we have developed and are developing a number of new vitoss based products and related delivery devices that are designed to expand the market for our vitoss products by broadening the range of surgical indications and by addressing additional surgeon preferences and needs 
in  we entered into a development  manufacturing and supply agreement with kensey  which led to the development and launch of the vitoss foam product platform 
the vitoss foam products combine our base vitoss technology with kensey s proprietary resorbable biomaterials to produce a wide array of pliant  flexible  flowable and compression resistant bone graft materials 
the vitoss foam products have the ability to soak and hold their own volume in blood and bone marrow aspirate while retaining these biological fluids in pliable and compression resistant forms 
these forms can be designed into specific shapes and material characteristics to meet a surgeon s need for handling and delivery in a variety of surgical approaches and applications 
we also launched vitoss cancellous chips during the first half of bone defect grafting 
injury or trauma to the bone  degenerative conditions  disease and aging all affect the health and viability of the human skeleton 
these conditions often result in the need for the repair of bone defects through a bone grafting procedure 
we estimate that approximately 
table of contents  bone grafting procedures on a worldwide basis are performed each year in the spine  extremities and pelvis 
bone grafting material is either i autograft material  which is often obtained or harvested from the iliac crest region of the patient s own hip  ii allograft material  which is obtained from a cadaver  or iii synthetically derived materials that provide one or more components of either bone like scaffold such as vitoss  cells or signals such as bone morphogenic proteins 
vitoss has been used in bone grafting procedures as a bone graft substitute to provide a synthetic scaffold in a variety of applications  including those of the extremities  spine and pelvis 
when used with the patient s bone marrow  vitoss provides all components of scaffold  cells and signals 
a harvest of autograft material involves an additional procedure that extends surgical time  adding to costs and increasing blood loss and patient risk of infection or adverse reaction from the additional time under anesthesia 
in addition  harvesting bone for autograft sometimes causes protracted pain that may necessitate additional medical care after the surgical procedure 
using vitoss instead of autograft material may avoid these potential complications 
disadvantages of allograft bone include the possibility of disease transmission  antigenic response and quality variability 
vitoss is a synthetic beta tricalcium phosphate material without these possible disadvantages 
spinal grafting 
many patients affected by severe back pain due to degeneration of one or more discs are treated with a spinal surgical procedure 
we estimate that each year approximately  spinal surgical procedures are done on a worldwide basis 
in cases where the patient has advanced disc degeneration or spinal instability  a spinal surgical procedure may involve a surgical incision in the patient s back or abdomen and frequently requires the removal of the affected disc material and the surgical attachment of a metal implant  spinal fusion cage  or machined bone derived from a cadaver to provide the initial support and intrinsic stability of the bony structure for the two surrounding vertebrae 
such spinal surgical procedures may require the use of a bone grafting material to help treat any surgically created bony defects 
we believe the use of vitoss as a bone void filler  rather than allograft or autograft materials  in spinal grafting procedures may be preferable for both the patient and the surgeon 
trauma 
physical trauma such as falls and accidents can result in bone fracture or damage 
fractures of broken bones are often realigned with hardware  such as plates  rods and screws 
once the hardware has been used to recreate the skeletal anatomy and to provide the stability of the bony structure  there are often defects or voids in the bone which remain 
those voids may require the use of bone graft material 
the goal of bone grafting in trauma applications is to rapidly heal the damaged bone 
approximately  trauma related bone graft repairs are performed annually on a worldwide basis 
autograft  cadaver allograft  as well as synthetic scaffolds like vitoss  are used for trauma related bone graft repairs 
vitoss has been used as a bone graft substitute in a variety of trauma applications  including those of the extremities  spine and pelvis 
dental  periodontal  oral and cranio maxillofacial 
in august  we entered into a supply agreement with biomimetic that allows biomimetic to use its rhpdgf in combination with our 
table of contents proprietary vitomatrix particulate synthetic scaffold biomaterial  which we produce in the same process used to manufacture vitoss 
under the agreement  we supply our proprietary beta tricalcium phosphate biomaterial to biomimetic for its clinical and commercial use in conjunction with rhpdgf 
biomimetic markets the combined product in the dental  periodontal  oral and cranio maxillofacial bone grafting markets 
bone marrow aspiration system with imbibe needles  syringes and imbibe disposable delivery instrumentation  used with vitoss bone marrow aspiration needle fda k cleared june bone marrow aspiration syringe fda k s cleared september and march disposable delivery funnel class i exempt device see government regulation below disposable delivery tube class i exempt device see government regulation below the disposable imbibe devices provide spine and orthopedic surgeons with a simple method for harvesting a patient s own bone marrow  mixing it with vitoss  and delivering the mixture to the bone graft site 
we believe imbibe  when used together with vitoss  will provide greater flexibility and options for surgeons 
imbibe is covered by a us issued patent 
vitagel surgical hemostat and accessories vitagel surgical hemostat pma approved  us distribution rights initially obtained june see government regulation below cellpaker plasma collection system pma approved  us distribution rights initially obtained june see government regulation below malleable extended applicator pma approved  us distribution rights obtained june see government regulation below laparoscopic extended applicator pma approved  us distribution rights obtained june see government regulation below vitagel spray set fda k cleared october vitagel is an fda approved  composite liquid hemostat that combines the biomaterials bovine thrombin and bovine collagen with the patient s autologous plasma 
when applied to the surgical site  vitagel creates a safe adherent matrix and an impermeable barrier to blood flow 
vitagel has been marketed to general surgeons and is applicable in the spine  hip and knee replacement surgery markets  where bleeding is a significant complication for many routine surgeries 
after initially obtaining the right to sell costasis from angiotech in june  we 
table of contents rebranded costasis as vitagel surgical hemostat in january with cellpaker accessories  and relaunched the product within our existing orthopedics and spine based sales channel  utilizing the same marketing strategy that we use for all of our vitoss related products 
this strategy provides our sales network additional functional biomaterial products to offer to customers 
during the first half of  we launched the vitagel spray set 
vitagel and cellpaker are covered by us and foreign issued patents owned by our licensor angiotech 
near term product development we have developed and are continuing to develop new products under our approved vitoss  vitagel and imbibe product platforms 
we may seek to bring vitoss  vitagel and or imbibe product line extensions to market in the us through the k or pma regulatory process see government regulation below 
these product line extensions will be in addition to our us cortoss investigational device exemption ide clinical program  which is described below 
cortoss bone augmentation material cortoss is a self setting glass ceramic polymeric composite engineered specifically to mimic the characteristics of human bone 
laboratory tests demonstrate that cortoss exhibits compressive strength similar to human bone 
for patients with poor bone healing  as seen in osteoporotic patients  cortoss may be used in a variety of surgical procedures to quickly provide structural stability and reinforcement of the bones after surgery 
the surgeon s goal is to repair the patient s bone and enhance the patient s mobility as quickly as possible since prolonged bed rest or inactivity may result in decreased overall health for older or osteoporotic patients 
cortoss s simple mix on demand delivery system design allows for minimum waste and maximum ease of use and flexibility for the surgeon 
cortoss is an injectable material that is delivered aseptically through a pre filled  unit dose  disposable cartridge 
delivery of cortoss to the surgical site may be started and stopped for a prolonged period of time throughout the surgical procedure as polymerization is initiated only when cortoss is expressed through its static mix tip 
the polymerization is a self setting reaction that causes cortoss to harden within minutes 
cortoss provides two stages of fixation immediate mechanical interlock into porous bone  followed by intimate bone growth over time along the contours of its surface 
cortoss is covered by several us issued patents and other us and foreign patent applications are pending 
we received ce certification for cortoss for use in screw augmentation procedures in october in the eu and regulatory approval in march in australia  which enables us to sell cortoss in these territories as well as in other countries that have adopted the eu s regulatory standards 
screw augmentation is a procedure for securing the fixation of bone screws used in patients with weak bone caused by osteoporosis 
we initiated a limited launch of cortoss in europe in december we successfully completed post marketing human clinical studies in europe for the use of cortoss in hip compression screw augmentation 
in 
table of contents addition  during january  we received ce certification in the eu to market cortoss for vertebral augmentation of vcfs of the spine 
vertebral augmentation of vcfs is a procedure for repairing fractured vertebrae that can be performed on an outpatient or short stay basis 
we have sold over  units of cortoss through december  during and  we completed patient enrollment of two fda approved ide pilot clinical studies in the us for the use of cortoss in vertebral augmentation of vcfs using the vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty surgical techniques  respectively 
we expect that the two pilot studies will be completed in the third quarter of both surgical techniques involve the injection of a self setting material into the vertebral body to provide internal fixation of the vcf 
upon fda review of the vertebroplasty pilot clinical data  we received approval from the fda to begin patient enrollment in a prospective  randomized control pivotal phase of that clinical study 
see government regulation cortoss below for more information about the design of the pivotal study 
the pivotal study was fully enrolled as of february  with cortoss patients and polymethylmethacrylate pmma patients 
patients will be followed at intervals up to months post procedure 
if the study data is supportive  we plan to seek fda clearance for cortoss in the us through the k regulatory process see government regulation below 
we do not expect to receive fda clearance for the sale of cortoss in the us prior to  if at all 
vertebral augmentation of vcfs 
we estimate there are approximately  patients in the us with vcfs caused by osteoporotic bone or bone cancer resulting in severe pain and immobility 
of these  we believe approximately  fractures are diagnosed 
the traditional treatments  eg  bed rest  bracing  narcotics or anesthetic injections  do not address the underlying fracture 
vertebral augmentation of vcfs has been reported to provide early pain relief in over of osteoporotic patients 
early relief of pain provided by vertebral augmentation of vcfs enables patients to maintain better functional capacity 
functional capacity  in turn  is believed to be directly related to the ability to live independently and unassisted 
we are not aware of any product that has received fda approval or ce certification for use in this procedure on the basis of prospective  controlled clinical data 
however  since several versions of pmma bone cement have been k cleared by the fda 
we believe cortoss may have several advantages over pmma in vertebral augmentation of vcfs  such as its lower temperature setting that reduces the risk of tissue necrosis associated with pmma  its higher compression strength and more natural elasticity and its ability to be mixed on demand 
in addition  unlike pmma  cortoss does not release volatile free unreacted monomers into the patient s body 
published data reports that monomer release has been shown to cause a variety of cardiopulmonary complications such as hypotension and emboli in the lungs and brain 
screw augmentation 
worldwide each year  we estimate approximately  orthopedic procedures are performed using internal fixation devices that involve screws  including pedicle  trauma and hip fracture screws 
cortoss may be used in those procedures where the screws strip or fail to hold the integrity of the internal fixation construct due to poor bone quality  as is often the case with osteoporotic bone 
where screws fail to hold  current treatment options include i replacing the screw with a screw of larger diameter  which may further weaken the bone and is not always possible because of the size of the screw holes and or the bone  or ii augmenting the screws with pmma bone cement  which is cumbersome and time consuming 
pmma must be manually mixed and transferred into a syringe for application 
after mixing  
table of contents there is only a small time window in which the pmma can be used before it sets  making it difficult to augment more than one screw at a time 
additionally  pmma bone cement is not approved in either europe or the us for pedicle  trauma or hip fracture screw augmentation 
we believe the use of cortoss to anchor the screw in a quick and efficient way enables the full function of the screw to be restored 
we are not aware of any cement products that have received fda approval or ce certification that would be in competition with cortoss for these indications 
aliquot delivery system our aliquot delivery system facilitates delivery of materials to bony sites  including delivery of our cortoss product directly to the surgical site 
a coaxial system of catheter and syringe dispenser is designed to assure effective delivery of material in vertebral augmentation of vcfs and screw augmentation procedures 
during the second quarter of  we received ce certification from our notified body for aliquot 
the aliquot system was used as part of our european multi center prospective clinical study for cortoss in vertebral augmentation of vcfs and was used in the us clinical studies for cortoss in vertebral augmentation of vcfs 
aliquot is covered by issued and pending us and foreign patents 
significant contractual obligations see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  included in this report for a discussion of significant contractual arrangements relating to i our joint product development and commercialization arrangements  ii our licensing arrangements and iii our revenue sharing arrangement 
our research development we employ composite engineering  polymer science  biologics processing  solution chemistry and nanoparticulate ceramic glass science to create our bio surgery materials technology platforms 
we then utilize biomaterials and biologic technologies developed  co developed or licensed by us to commercialize bio surgery products for spine and orthopedic surgical applications 
patents have been issued and additional patent applications have been filed to protect our key biomaterial developments 
see patents and proprietary intellectual property below for additional information 
we incurred approximately   and  in research and development expenses in  and  respectively 
patents and proprietary intellectual property our strategy is to seek protection for our product technologies and manufacturing methods through the use of us and foreign patents 
we have filed or intend to file applications as appropriate for patents covering our technologies  products and processes 
as of the date of this filing  the products we have developed and marketed are covered by one or more of our eighteen issued us patents  nineteen pending us patent applications and numerous counterparts of certain of these patents and pending patent applications outside the us  including canada  europe  mexico and japan 
our patents are set to expire between and  however  
table of contents certain of our patents may be extendable under united states code  which pertains to the extension of the patent term 
manufacturing and product supply the manufacture of our products is subject to regulation and periodic inspection by various regulatory bodies for compliance with current fda quality system regulations  eu medical devices directive  international organization for standardization iso series standards  iso european norm en and equivalent requirements 
our  square foot vitoss  vitagel and cortoss manufacturing facilities that produce our commercial products are leased through july and are certified as meeting the requirements of iso and en for the period july  through july  these facilities are subject to inspection by the fda for compliance with fda device manufacture requirements 
the most recent fda inspection in june resulted in no fda form observations cited 
we believe our existing manufacturing facilities have the capacity to meet our commercial needs into in the fourth quarter of  we commenced renovations at sites we currently lease to expand our capacity to manufacture our products 
we expect to complete the manufacturing facilities expansion by the end of we currently manufacture vitoss  vitagel and cortoss at our manufacturing facilities 
we are manufacturing cellpaker  imbibe and aliquot through outside third party contract manufacturers 
our vitoss is converted to vitoss foam by kensey  our development partner under a long term supply agreement 
our third party manufacturers are regulated by government agencies and are required to be iso en certified or otherwise meet our quality system requirements see government regulation below 
our ability to manufacture our products is dependent on a limited number of specialty suppliers of certain raw materials 
we have a supply agreement which provides bovine collagen for the manufacture of vitagel 
the initial term of the supply agreement expires in august  however  we received notice in the first quarter of from our supplier of its intent to cease production of bovine collagen between january  and june  and sell or close its collagen processing plant by december  we are seeking to obtain a strategic collagen reserve for vitagel and are exploring solutions to ensure long and short term collagen supply 
if we locate a new source of collagen for vitagel or otherwise modify its manufacturing process or raw material components  we may need to obtain approval for such modification from the fda in the form of a pma supplement 
see government regulation united states 
we also have a supply agreement with kensey for bovine collagen used in our vitoss foam product line 
we do not have any other supply agreements for raw materials 
the failure of a supplier to continue to provide us with these materials at a price or quality acceptable to us  or at all  or our inability to find an alternative supplier with acceptable prices and quality  would have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture these products 
moreover  our failure to continue to maintain strategic reserve supplies of each significant single sourced material used to manufacture vitoss  cortoss and certain products that we may develop in the future may result in a breach of our material financing agreement with royalty securitization trust i 
table of contents royalty trust and successor in interest to paul capital royalty acquisition fund  lp  which is described below in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation critical accounting policies revenue interest obligation 
sales and marketing in june  we began to assemble a us field sales network of direct sales representatives and independent sales agencies who now market vitoss  vitagel  cellpaker and imbibe 
we continually seek to strengthen our field sales network through the addition of direct sales representatives in those us sales territories where either we do not have independent sales agency coverage or the territories are underserved 
outside of the us  we primarily utilize a network of independent  stocking distributors to market vitoss  cortoss  and aliquot 
competition extensive research efforts and rapid technological change characterize the market for products in the orthopedic market 
we face intense competition from medical device  biomedical technology  and medical products companies 
our products could be rendered noncompetitive or obsolete by competitors technological advances 
we may be unable to respond to technological advances through the development and introduction of new products 
moreover  many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  sales  distribution  manufacturing and technological resources than us 
these competitors may also be in the process of seeking fda or other regulatory approvals  or patent protection  for new products 
our competitors could  therefore  commercialize new competing products in advance of our products 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we believe vitoss faces competition from numerous synthetic  bone morphogenic proteins bmps and cadaver based products  such as demineralized bone matrix dbm products  currently on the market that may be used for the same indications as our products as well as other products and technologies that may enter the market in the future 
in  total disc replacement devices tdrs were introduced in the spinal market as a treatment alternative for degenerative disc disease designed to preserve the motion of the vertebrae of the spine 
these tdrs could negatively impact the spinal fusion market which could in turn adversely impact the use of vitoss in spine grafting procedures 
however  we believe that several factors mitigate against the broad use of tdrs  including the need for surgeon training  the high level of surgeon technical skills required  surgeon concern regarding the challenges of tdr revision surgery should that become necessary due to loosening or subsidence of the device over time  and procedure reimbursement 
it is too early to estimate the rate at which the market will ultimately adopt this or comparable technology as a treatment alternative or its resulting impact on our products 
vitagel is approved by the fda as a surgical hemostat where bleeding may be a significant complication for many routine surgeries 
as such  vitagel can be marketed broadly to general surgeons and is applicable in the spine  hip and knee replacement surgery markets 
vitagel 
table of contents faces competition from several more established surgical hemostat products marketed by other companies with substantially greater resources than us 
however  we believe vitagel offers unique advantages in comparison to these other products in terms of vitagel s quick and easy preparation for use  as well as its use of the patient s autologous plasma instead of pooled donated human plasma as is the case with the leading products in the market 
cortoss is under clinical development in the us for use in the vertebral augmentation of vcfs and has received ce certification for use in vertebral augmentation of vcfs and in screw augmentation 
if cortoss is cleared by the fda for use in vertebral augmentation of vcfs  it will face competition from the several pmma bone cement products that have been k cleared by the fda since for this indication 
outside the us  cortoss is facing competition from several other pmma bone cement products that have received ce certification since for this indication 
we do not know of any products that have received fda approval or a ce certification for use in screw augmentation or for which such approval is being sought 
government regulation in order to market our products  we must apply for  be granted and maintain all necessary regulatory approvals  clearances and certifications 
in addition  we must comply with all regulatory requirements in each applicable jurisdiction 
we have received k regulatory clearance in the us from the fda in december  and ce certification in the eu from our notified body in july  for vitoss 
we also received regulatory approval to sell vitoss in australia and canada in march and june  respectively 
the ce certification permits us to sell our approved products in all of the countries of the eu as well as in other countries  such as switzerland and israel  that have mutual recognition agreements with the eu or have adopted the eu s regulatory standards 
we received k regulatory clearance for vitoss canisters and vitoss foam in november and december  respectively  in the us from the fda 
in september and june  we received k regulatory clearance in the us from the fda to market our imbibe product for use as a bone marrow aspiration syringe and needle  respectively 
cortoss we received ce certification for cortoss in october in the eu and regulatory approval in march in australia  which enables us to sell cortoss in these territories for use in securing the fixation of bone screws in patients with weak bone caused by osteoporosis 
in addition  during january our ce certification was extended to enable us to market cortoss in the eu for vertebral augmentation of vcfs  including compression fractures of the spine caused by osteoporosis and invasive tumors 
during the second quarter of  we received ce certification from our notified body for aliquot  which facilitates delivery of cortoss 
during and  we completed patient enrollment of two fda approved ide pilot clinical studies in the us for the use of cortoss in vertebral augmentation of vcfs using the vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty surgical techniques  respectively 
we expect that the two pilot 
table of contents studies will be completed in the third quarter of both surgical techniques involve the injection of a self setting material into the vertebral body to provide internal fixation of the vcf 
upon fda review of the vertebroplasty pilot clinical data  we received approval from fda to begin patient enrollment in a prospective  randomized controlled pivotal phase of that clinical study 
the study design was subsequently amended and approved by the fda in august to allow the comparison of cortoss to a treatment arm using pmma bone cement instead of a non treatment arm consisting of conservative care and pain management 
in february  we completed enrollment of the pivotal cortoss study  which was conducted under an fda investigational device exemption ide 
a total of patients were enrolled in the pivotal study with a randomization of approximately patients treated using cortoss and patients treated using a pmma bone cement at sites 
patients will be followed at intervals of up to months post procedure 
if data from the pivotal study is supportive  we intend to seek clearance to market cortoss in the us through a k submission 
we do not expect to receive fda clearance for the sale of cortoss in the us prior to  if at all 
the following discussion summarizes the regulatory requirements applicable to our products 
united states the medical devices that we manufacture and market  or intend to market  are subject to extensive regulation by the fda 
pursuant to the federal food  drug and cosmetic act ffd c act and the regulations promulgated thereunder  the fda regulates the clinical testing  manufacture  labeling  distribution and promotion of medical devices 
noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in  among other things  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  failure of the government to grant premarket clearance or premarket approval for devices  withdrawal of marketing approvals clearances and criminal prosecution 
in the us  medical devices are classified into one of three classes class i  ii or iii on the basis of the controls deemed necessary by the fda to reasonably assure their safety and effectiveness 
under fda regulations  class i devices  the least regulated category  are subject to general controls and class ii devices are subject to general and special controls 
generally  class iii devices are those that must receive premarket approval by the fda to ensure their safety and effectiveness 
before we can introduce a new device into the market  we must generally obtain market clearance through a k notification or premarket approval through a premarket approval pma application 
a k clearance will be granted if the submitted information establishes that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed class i or ii medical device  or to a class iii medical device for which the fda has not required a pma 
the fda may determine that a proposed device is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device  or that additional information or data are needed before a substantial equivalence determination can be made 
a request for additional data may require that clinical studies be performed to establish the device s substantial equivalence 
commercial distribution of a device for which a k notification is required can begin only 
table of contents after the fda issues a letter finding the device to be substantially equivalent to a predicate device 
pursuant to the ffd c act  the fda must make a determination with respect to a k submission within days of its receipt 
the fda may  and often does  extend this time frame by requesting additional data or information 
a not substantially equivalent determination  or a request for additional information  could delay or prevent the market introduction of new products for which we file such notifications 
for any of our products that are cleared through the k process  modifications or enhancements that could significantly affect the safety or efficacy of the device or that constitute a major change to the intended use of the device will require new k submissions 
the fda has implemented a policy under which certain device modifications may be submitted as a special k  which will require only a day review 
special k s are limited to those device modifications that do not affect the intended use or alter the fundamental scientific technology of the device and for which substantial equivalence can be demonstrated through design controls 
we must file a pma if our proposed device is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed class i or class ii device  or if it is a class iii preamendment device on the market since prior to may  for which fda has called for pmas 
a pma must be supported by valid scientific evidence that typically includes extensive data  including pre clinical and clinical trial data  to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device  as well as extensive manufacturing information 
fda review of a pma generally takes one to two years from the date the pma is accepted for filing  but may take significantly longer 
the review time is often significantly extended should the fda ask for more information or clarification of information already provided in the submission 
during the pma review period  an advisory committee  typically a panel of clinicians  will likely be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the fda as to whether the device should be approved 
the fda is not bound by the recommendations of the advisory panel 
toward the end of the pma review process  the fda generally will conduct an inspection of the manufacturer s facilities to ensure that they are in compliance with quality system regulation qsr requirements 
if the fda s evaluations of both the pma and the manufacturing facilities are favorable  the fda will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter  which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the pma 
when  and if  those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the fda  the agency will issue an approval letter  authorizing commercial marketing of the device for certain indications 
if the fda s evaluation of the pma or manufacturing facilities is not favorable  the fda will deny approval of the pma or issue a not approvable letter 
the fda may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary  in which case pma approval may be delayed up to several years while we conduct additional clinical trials and submit an amendment to the pma 
the pma process can be expensive  uncertain and lengthy  and a number of devices for which other companies have sought fda approval have never been approved for marketing 

table of contents modifications to a device that is the subject of an approved pma including modifications to its labeling  raw material components or manufacturing process may require approval by the fda in the form of a pma supplement or new pma 
supplements to a pma often require the submission of the same type of information required for an initial pma  except that the supplement is generally limited to that information needed to support the proposed change from the product covered by the original pma 
if clinical trials of a device are required in connection with either a k notification or a pma and the device presents a significant risk  we will be required to file an ide application prior to commencing clinical trials 
the ide application must be supported by data  typically including the results of animal and laboratory testing 
if the ide application is reviewed and approved by the fda and one or more appropriate institutional review boards irbs  clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients  as approved by the fda 
if the device presents a non significant risk to the patient  we may begin the clinical trials after obtaining approval for the study by one or more appropriate irbs 
for significant risk devices  we must submit an ide supplement to the fda and receive approval from the fda before we  or our investigator  may make a change to the investigational plan that may affect its scientific soundness or the rights  safety or welfare of human subjects 
irb approval may be required for changes in the investigational plan for both non significant risk and significant risk devices 
any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to fda clearances or approvals are subject to extensive regulation by the fda  including reporting and record keeping requirements 
device manufacturers are required to register their establishments and list their devices with the fda and certain state agencies  and are subject to periodic inspections by the fda and certain state agencies 
our most recent fda inspection in june resulted in no observations with no corrective actions being required 
the ffd c act requires devices to be manufactured in accordance with qsr requirements that impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities 
medical devices are also subject to post market reporting requirements for deaths or serious injuries when the device may have caused or contributed to the death or serious injury  and for certain device malfunctions that would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur 
if safety or efficacy problems occur after the product reaches the market  the fda may impose severe limitations on the use of any approved or cleared product 
our labeling and promotion activities are subject to scrutiny by the fda and  in certain instances  by the federal trade commission 
the fda actively enforces regulations prohibiting marketing of products for unapproved or uncleared uses 
we  as well as our products  are also subject to a variety of state laws and regulations in those states or localities where our products are or will be marketed 
any applicable state or local regulations may hinder our ability to market our products in those states or localities 
we are also subject to numerous federal  state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions  manufacturing practices  environmental protection  fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances 
there can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future or that such laws or regulations will 
table of contents not have a material adverse effect upon our ability to do business 
noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in  among other things  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  failure of the government to grant the pre market clearance or premarket approval for devices  withdrawal of marketing approvals  clearances and criminal prosecution 
europe in order to sell our products within the eu  we are required to achieve compliance with the requirements of the mdd and affix a ce mark on our products to attest such compliance 
to achieve this  our products must meet the essential requirements defined under the mdd relating to safety and performance and we must successfully undergo a verification of our regulatory compliance conformity assessment by an independent notified body 
we have selected tno  the netherlands organization for applied science research  as our notified body 
the nature of the conformity assessment will depend on the regulatory class of our products 
under european law  our products  other than imbibe and aliquot which are class i sterile and class ii a  respectively  are likely to be in class iii 
in the case of class iii products  we must as a result of the regulatory structure which we have elected to follow establish and maintain a complete quality system for design and manufacture as described in annex ii of the mdd and demonstrated by compliance with en we are certified as meeting the requirements of iso and en for the period july  through july  our notified body has audited our quality system and determined that it meets the requirements of the mdd 
in addition  the notified body must approve the specific design of each device in class iii  iia and iib 
as part of the design approval process  the notified body must also verify that the products comply with the essential requirements of the mdd 
in order to comply with these requirements  we must  among other things  complete a risk analysis and may be required to present clinical data 
the clinical data presented by us must provide evidence that the products meet the performance specifications claimed by us  provide sufficient evidence of adequate assessment of unwanted side effects and demonstrate that the benefits to the patient outweigh the risks associated with the device 
we are subject to continued surveillance by the notified body and are required to report any serious adverse incidents to the appropriate authorities 
the decision of the notified body is valid for a maximum of five years but may be extended by application for additional five year periods 
we also are required to comply with additional national requirements that are outside of the scope of the mdd 
there can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future or that such laws or regulations will not have a material adverse effect upon our ability to do business 
third party reimbursement successful sales of our products in the us and other markets will depend on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third party payers relative to our products 
in the us  health care providers  such as hospitals and physicians that purchase or utilize our products for treatment of their patients  generally rely on independent third party payers  such as private insurance companies or hmos  and governmental payers  such as medicare and medicaid  to reimburse all or part of the costs and fees associated with the provision of items and services 
table of contents using our products 
physicians  hospitals  and other health care providers may not purchase our products if they do not receive satisfactory reimbursement from these payers for the cost of procedures using our products 
each payer has its own process and standards for determining whether it will cover and reimburse a procedure or particular product 
private payers often rely on the lead of the governmental payers in rendering coverage and reimbursement determinations 
therefore  achieving favorable medicare coverage and reimbursement is usually a significant gating issue for successful introduction of a new product 
medicare is a federally funded program managed by the centers for medicare and medicaid services  through local fiscal intermediaries and carriers  that administers coverage and reimbursement for certain health care items and services furnished to the elderly and disabled 
medicaid is an insurance program for the poor that is both federally and state funded and managed by each state 
the federal government sets general guidelines for medicaid and each state creates specific regulations that govern their individual program 
medicare provides  among other things  health care benefits that cover  within prescribed limits  the major costs of most medically necessary care for such individuals  subject to certain deductibles and co payments 
the medicare program has established  and continues to establish  standards and guidelines for the coverage and reimbursement of certain procedures  equipment  supplies and other items and services 
generally  in order to be covered and reimbursed by medicare  a health care item or service furnished to a medicare beneficiary must be reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury or to improve the functioning of a malformed body part 
the methodology for determining the coverage status of our products  and the amount of medicare reimbursement for our products  varies based upon  among other factors  the setting in which a medicare beneficiary received health care items and services 
acute care hospitals are generally reimbursed by medicare for inpatient operating costs based upon prospectively determined rates 
under the prospective payment system pps  acute care hospitals receive a predetermined payment rate based upon the diagnosis related group  or drg  into which each medicare beneficiary stay is assigned  regardless of the actual cost of the services provided 
certain additional or outlier payments may be made to a hospital for cases involving unusually high costs 
accordingly  acute care hospitals generally do not receive direct medicare reimbursement under pps for the distinct costs incurred in purchasing our products 
rather  reimbursement for these costs is deemed to be included within the drg based payments made to hospitals for the services furnished to medicare eligible inpatients in which our products are utilized 
because pps payments are based on predetermined rates and may be less than a hospital s actual costs in furnishing care  acute care hospitals have incentives to lower their inpatient operating costs by utilizing equipment  devices and supplies  including those sold by us  that will reduce the length of inpatient stays  decrease labor or otherwise lower their costs 
our product revenue could be affected negatively if acute care hospitals discontinue product use due to insufficient reimbursement  or if other treatment options are perceived to be more cost effective 
medicare also reimburses most outpatient services based on a prospective or predetermined payment basis  subject to certain exceptions and limitations 
similarly  some states reimburse certain health care providers for inpatient services under their medicaid 
table of contents programs by using prospective rates for diagnosis related groups of illnesses 
therefore  health care providers may refuse to use our products if coverage or reimbursement is inadequate 
also  any changes in federal legislation  regulations and policy affecting medicare coverage and reimbursement relative to our products could have a material effect on our results of operations 
inadequate coverage or reimbursement by private insurance companies and government programs could significantly reduce usage of our products 
in addition  an increasing emphasis on managed care in the us has placed  and we believe will continue to place  greater pressure on medical device pricing 
such pressures could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our products profitably 
failure by hospitals and other users of our products to obtain favorable coverage or reimbursement from third party payers or changes in governmental and private third party payers policies toward coverage or reimbursement for procedures employing our products could reduce demand for our products 
member countries of the eu operate various combinations of centrally financed health care systems and private health insurance systems 
the relative importance of government and private systems varies from country to country 
the choice of devices is subject to constraints imposed by the availability of funds within the purchasing institution and by hospital and authority priorities 
medical devices are most commonly sold to hospitals or health care facilities at a price set by negotiation between the buyer and the seller 
a contract to purchase products may result from an individual initiative or as a result of a competitive bidding process 
in either case  the purchaser pays the supplier  and payment terms vary widely throughout the eu 
failure to obtain favorable negotiated prices with hospitals or health care facilities could adversely affect sales of our products 
health care fraud and abuse laws to the extent our products receive government reimbursements  we are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse  including anti kickback laws and false claims laws 
violations of these laws are punishable by criminal  civil and or administrative sanctions  including  in some instances  imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs  including medicare  medicaid and veterans health programs 
because of the far reaching nature of these laws  there can be no assurance that the occurrence of one or more violations of these laws would not result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
anti kickback laws 
to the extent that our products receive government reimbursement  our operations are subject to federal and state anti kickback laws 
certain provisions of the social security act prohibit entities such as us from knowingly and willingly offering  paying  soliciting or receiving any form of remuneration including any kickbacks  bribe or rebate in return for the referral of items or services for which payment may be made under a federal health care program  or in return for the recommendation  arrangement  purchase  lease or order of items or services for which payment may be made under a federal health care program 
violation of the federal anti kickback law is a felony  punishable by criminal fines and imprisonment for up to five years or both 
in addition  the department of health and human services may impose civil penalties and exclude violators from participation in federal health care programs such as 
table of contents medicare and medicaid 
many states have adopted similar prohibitions against payments intended to induce referrals of products or services paid by medicaid or other third party payors 
false claims 
the federal false claims act imposes civil and criminal liability on individuals or entities who submit or cause the submission of false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government 
violations of the federal false claims act may result in penalties equal to three times the damages which the government sustained  an assessment of between  and  per claim  civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs 
the federal false claims act also allows a private individual to bring a qui tam suit on behalf of the government against an individual or entity for violations of the false claims act 
in a qui tam suit  the private plaintiff is responsible for initiating a lawsuit that may eventually lead to the government recovering money of which it was defrauded 
after the private plaintiff has initiated the lawsuit  the government must decide whether to intervene in the lawsuit and become the primary prosecutor 
in the event the government declines to join the lawsuit  the private plaintiff may choose to pursue the case alone  in which case the private plaintiff s counsel will have primary control over the prosecution although the government must be kept apprised of the progress of the lawsuit 
in return for bringing the suit on the government s behalf  the statute provides that the private plaintiff is entitled to receive up to of the recovered amount from the litigation proceeds if the litigation is successful plus reasonable expenses and attorneys fees 
recently  the number of qui tam suits brought against entities in the health care industry has increased dramatically 
in addition  a number of states have enacted laws modeled after the false claims act that allow those states to recover money which was fraudulently obtained from the state 
other fraud and abuse laws 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of created  in part  two new federal crimes health care fraud and false statements relating to health care matters 
the health care fraud statute prohibits the knowing and willful execution of a scheme or artifice to defraud any health care benefit program 
a violation of the statute is a felony and may result in fines and or imprisonment 
the false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying  concealing or covering up a material fact by any trick  scheme or device or making any materially false  fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits  items or services 
a violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines and or imprisonment 
the countries of the eu have individual and varying legislative provisions governing health care fraud and abuse  including provisions governing inducement to purchase 
violation of these provisions can lead to action both against the provider of the device and against the health care provider 
product liability and insurance we manufacture medical devices used on patients in surgery  and we may be subject to product liability lawsuits 
we have experienced two product liability claims to date  which we have successfully defended 
there can be no assurance that other product liability claims will not be 
table of contents asserted against us in the future 
under certain of our agreements with our independent sales agencies  stocking distributors and hospital customers  we provide indemnification from product liability claims 
any product liability claim brought against us  with or without merit  could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates or the inability to secure coverage in the future 
in addition  we would have to pay any amount awarded by a court in excess of policy limits 
we maintain product liability insurance in the annual aggregate amount of up to  although our insurance policies have various exclusions 
thus  we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no insurance coverage  in which case we may have to pay the entire amount of any award 
employees as of december   we had full time employees  with employees at our malvern  pennsylvania headquarters  employees throughout the us and employees in europe 
we consider our relations with our employees to be good 
item a 
risk factors if our current products are not commercially successful  or if we do not increase our product portfolio and successfully commercialize new products  our operating results will be impaired and our viability jeopardized 
we are highly dependent on successfully selling our products for which we have received regulatory approval or clearance 
we do not expect to obtain regulatory approvals or clearances in the united states for any of our products under development  if obtained at all  prior to to date  we have received regulatory clearance or approval to market vitoss  cortoss and aliquot for specified uses in the european union  australia and countries adhering to the regulatory standards of the european union 
we have also received regulatory clearance or approval to market vitoss  imbibe  and vitagel in the united states 
revenues generated from sales of our approved or cleared products in their approved territories have not been and in the future may not be sufficient to fund operations 
there is no assurance that we can increase our product portfolio or that any additional products will be commercially successful and generate revenues sufficient to fund operations 
in particular  if our cortoss product is not cleared in the united states or does not become commercially successful  our long term viability may be jeopardized 
certain factors that may limit our ability to increase sales include the ability of our direct sales representatives to develop and retain a customer base and compete with larger sales forces with more extensive product portfolios  our dependence on the efforts of independent agents and distributors to promote the use of our products  over which we have limited control  the introduction of new products into the market by competing orthopedic companies based upon other competing technologies  our dependence on the continued publication of independent pre clinical and clinical data 
table of contents to support the use of our products  our need to train a sufficient number of surgeons to create demand for our products  and the need for payors to authorize insurance reimbursement for procedures using our products 
market acceptance of our products will largely depend on our ability to demonstrate their relative safety  efficacy  cost effectiveness and ease of use 
surgeons will not use our products unless they determine  based on experience  clinical data and recommendations from prominent surgeons and mentors that our products are safe and effective 
our products are based on newer technologies and must compete with more established treatments currently accepted as the standards of care 
the attributes of some of our products may require some changes in surgical techniques that have become standard within the medical community  and there may be resistance to change 
therefore  for these products  we must be able to convince surgeons who currently favor existing techniques to switch to new procedures that would use our products 
many surgeons will not purchase our products until there is sufficient  long term clinical evidence to convince them to alter their existing treatment methods 
in addition  surgeons may be slow to change their medical treatment practices because of perceived liability risks arising from the use of new products and the uncertainty of third party reimbursement for our products 
any failure to gain market acceptance of our products could result in lower sales and the inability to become profitable 
if losses continue in the long term  it could limit our growth in the orthopedic industry and jeopardize our viability 
we have experienced negative operating cash flows since our inception and have funded our operations primarily from proceeds received from sales of our stock 
in july  we raised approximately  in net proceeds from the sale of  shares of our common stock to angiotech 
in december  we raised an aggregate of approximately  in net proceeds from the sale of  shares of our common stock to institutional investors 
in november and december  we raised approximately  in net proceeds from the sale of  shares of our common stock to institutional investors 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents  and investments of  as of december  will be sufficient to meet our currently estimated operating and investing requirements at least into the second quarter of to date  we have not been profitable 
we have incurred substantial operating losses since our inception and at december   had an accumulated deficit of  these losses have resulted principally from the development and patenting of our technologies  pre clinical and clinical studies  preparation of submissions to the fda and foreign regulatory bodies  and the development of manufacturing  sales and marketing capabilities 
we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses in the future as we continue our product development efforts  expand our marketing and sales activities and further develop our manufacturing capabilities 
we may not ever successfully commercialize our products in development 
we may never be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future and our 
table of contents products may never be commercially accepted or generate sufficient product sales to fund operations 
we expect to raise additional capital 
if we are unable to raise additional capital in the future  our product development could be limited and our long term viability may be threatened  however  if we raise additional capital  your percentage ownership as a shareholder of orthovita will decrease and constraints could be placed on the operation of our business 
we plan to seek to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financings  or strategic alliances with third parties either alone or in combination with equity or debt financing investments 
there are factors that may cause our future capital requirements to be greater than anticipated or could accelerate our need for funds including  without limitation unforeseen developments during our pre clinical and clinical trials  delays in the timing of receipt of required regulatory approvals or clearances to make or sell products  unforeseen difficulties in operating an effective direct sales and distribution network  unanticipated expenditures in research and product development or manufacturing activities  delayed  insufficient or lack of market acceptance of our products  unanticipated expenditures in the acquisition and defense of intellectual property rights  the failure to develop strategic alliances for the marketing of some of our products  unforeseen changes in healthcare reimbursement for procedures using our products  inability to increase sales of our approved or cleared products  inability to train a sufficient number of surgeons to create demand for our products  lack of financial resources to adequately support our operations  difficulties in maintaining commercial scale manufacturing capacity and capability  unforeseen problems with our third party manufacturers and service providers or with our specialty suppliers of certain raw materials  unanticipated difficulties in operating in international markets  inability to meet our obligations under our revenue sharing agreement  the need to respond to technological changes and increased competition  unforeseen problems in attracting and retaining qualified personnel to market our products  enactment of new legislation or administrative regulation  the application to our business of new court decisions and regulatory interpretations  claims that might be brought in excess of our insurance coverage  any imposition of penalties for failure to comply with regulatory guidelines  or management s perception that uncertainties relating to these factors may be increasing 
in addition  although we have no present commitments or understandings to do so  we may seek to expand our operations and product line through acquisitions or joint ventures 
any such acquisitions or joint ventures may increase our capital requirements 

table of contents if we do not manage commercial scale manufacturing capability and capacity for our products in compliance with regulatory requirements and in a cost effective manner  our product sales may suffer 
the manufacture of our products is subject to regulation and periodic inspection by various regulatory bodies for compliance with current fda quality system regulation and requirements  and eu medical device directives requirements  international organization for standardization iso series standards  iso european norm en and equivalent requirements 
our  square foot vitoss  vitagel and cortoss fda registered manufacturing facilities located in malvern  pennsylvania produce our commercial products  are leased through july and are certified as meeting the requirements of iso and en for the period july  through july  these facilities are subject to inspection by the fda for compliance with fda device manufacture requirements 
the most recent fda inspection in june resulted in no fda form observations cited 

pursuant to our license agreement with angiotech  we assumed full responsibility for manufacturing vitagel in and cellpaker in after receiving the requisite approvals from the fda 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with fda requirements to continue to manufacture vitoss  vitagel  cortoss or cellpaker  which could result in delay or inability to manufacture and sell the products 
we believe our manufacturing facilities have the capacity to meet our commercial needs at least into and plan to expand our manufacturing capacity in to meet our commercial needs for the next several years 
our third party manufacturers are also regulated by governmental agencies and are required to be iso en certified or otherwise meet our quality system requirements 
we manufacture cellpaker  imbibe and aliquot through outside third party contract manufacturers 
our vitoss is converted to vitoss foam by kensey  our development partner 
our product sales depend upon  among other things  our ability to manufacture our products in commercial quantities  in compliance with regulatory requirements and in a cost effective manner 
the manufacture of our products is subject to regulation and periodic inspection by the fda and other regulatory bodies for compliance with quality standards 
there can be no assurance that the regulatory authorities will not  during the course of an inspection of existing or new facilities  identify what they consider to be deficiencies in meeting the applicable standards and request or seek remedial action 
failure to comply with such regulations or a delay in attaining compliance may result in warning letters  injunctions suspending the manufacture of products  civil and criminal penalties  
table of contents refusal to grant premarket approvals or clearances  ce certifications  ce certification renewals  or clearances to products that are subject to future or pending submissions  product recalls or seizures of products  and total or partial suspensions of production 
if we or any of our third party manufacturers cannot produce our products  our product sales may suffer 
if we are unable to operate an effective sales and distribution network  our ability to generate sales and become profitable will be impaired 
we have assembled a field sales network of independent sales agencies and direct sales representatives in the us in order to market vitoss  vitagel and imbibe 
outside of the us  we utilize a network of independent stocking distributors to market vitoss  cortoss and aliquot 
we seek to strengthen our field sales network through the addition of direct sales representatives in those us territories where we either do not have independent sales agency coverage or the territories are underserved 
we are dependent upon our distributors  sales agencies and direct sales representatives for the sale of our products 
any failure to maintain and effectively manage our distribution network will impair our ability to generate additional sales and become profitable 
there can be no assurance that the distributors and agencies will perform their obligations in their respective territories as expected  or that we will continue to derive any revenue from these arrangements 
we cannot assure that our interests will continue to coincide with those of our distributors and agencies 
in addition  we cannot assure that our distributors and agencies will not develop independently  or with other companies  other competitive products 
the independent us agencies selling vitoss generally sell products from other orthopedic companies 
a single agency may sell vitoss  as well as hardware manufactured by other orthopedic companies consisting of metal plates  screws and titanium spinal cages  to end user hospitals 
our sales could be adversely affected if  for any reason  one or more of our successful agencies lost their hardware product line provided by other orthopedic companies 
additionally  our independent agencies may be unable or unwilling to carry or effectively sell vitoss as a result of the introduction of new products into the market based upon other technologies that could compete with vitoss 
our sales could be adversely affected if one or more of our successful agencies eliminated vitoss from their product line for any other reason and terminated their agency arrangement with us 
our sales could also be adversely affected if our independent agencies become concerned that their agency arrangement with us could be eliminated as a result of another company s offer or threat to acquire us 
the complete product line represented by the distributors and agencies  including our products  is an important factor in the distributors or agencies ability to penetrate the market 
accordingly  our ability to penetrate the markets that we intend to serve is highly dependent upon the quality and breadth of the other 
table of contents product lines carried by our distribution network  the components of which may change from time to time  and over which we have little or no control 
in an effort to further accelerate the growth of sales  we continue to build our sales management team and add direct sales representatives to our organization for certain open or underserved territories in the us the addition of direct sales representatives will increase our operating expenses 
furthermore  there is no assurance that adding direct sales representatives will improve sales or that our direct sales representatives will be successful in generating sufficient sales to cover the cost of supporting their sales activities 
there is no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel to market or sell our products or that we will successfully implement this type of sales and distribution method 
we may incur significant liability if it is determined that we are promoting the off label use of our medical devices 
the unapproved or off label use of our products could also adversely affect the reputation of our products 
under the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act and other laws  we are prohibited from labeling  training  or promoting our products for off label uses 
this prohibition means that we may not proactively discuss or provide information or training on the use of our products outside of their cleared or approved uses  except in certain limited scientific and other settings 
in the practice of medicine  physicians may use devices for off label uses 
because the interpretation of these requirements is subjective  fda could deem some of our activities as promotional even when we believe in good faith that such activities were not promotional 
a company that is found to have improperly promoted off label uses may be subject to significant liability  including civil and administrative remedies as well as criminal sanctions 
enforcement measures taken against us could harm our business 
the medical devices that we manufacture and market  or intend to market  are subject to extensive regulation by the fda  the european union medical device directive and other worldwide regulatory agencies 
in order to market our products  we must apply for  receive and maintain all necessary regulatory approvals or clearances in each applicable jurisdiction for specified uses of the products 
under fda regulations and laws of other countries  we are only permitted to commercially distribute our products for approved indication s or use s  failure to comply with these regulations may subject us to fda and other enforcement action 
cortoss received ce certification  an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance with applicable european medical device directives  in january for use in repairing vertebral compression fractures 
however  surgeons may have attempted to use cortoss off label in procedures to repair vertebral compression fractures performed prior to the european union s approval of cortoss for this type of procedure 
furthermore  all surgeons have not been trained in the proper use of cortoss to repair vertebral compression fractures 
a surgeon who has not been properly trained to use cortoss in a procedure to repair vertebral compression fractures could pose a risk to the reputation of our cortoss product 
in addition  the occurrence of an adverse event while using our product off label in procedures other than the repair of vertebral compression fractures or screw augmentation could adversely affect the reputation of cortoss or any of our other products as well as us 

table of contents if we do not successfully train a sufficient number of surgeons  demand for our products could be adversely affected 
it is critical to the commercial success of our products that our independent distributors  agents and direct sales representatives succeed in training a sufficient number of surgeons and in providing them adequate instruction in the use of our products 
this training requires a commitment of time and money by surgeons that they may be unwilling to give 
even if surgeons are willing  if they are not properly trained  they may misuse or ineffectively use our products 
this may result in unsatisfactory patient outcomes  patient injury  negative publicity or lawsuits against us  any of which could damage our business and reduce product sales 
if health care providers cannot obtain third party reimbursement for procedures using our products  or if such reimbursement is inadequate  we may never become profitable 
successful sales of our products in the united states and other markets will depend on the availability of adequate reimbursement from third party payors 
healthcare providers  such as hospitals and surgeons that purchase medical devices for treatment of their patients  generally rely on third party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs and fees associated with the procedures performed with these devices 
both public and private insurance reimbursement plans are central to new product acceptance 
healthcare providers may refuse to use our products if reimbursement is inadequate 
we do not yet know how reimbursement will be handled for all of our products because some procedures that use our products are new and reimbursement policies regarding these procedures have not been finalized 
inadequate reimbursement by private insurance companies and government programs could significantly reduce usage of our products 
in addition  an increasing emphasis on managed care in the united states has placed  and we believe will continue to place  greater pressure on medical device pricing 
such pressures could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our products profitably 
we could be negatively impacted by future interpretation or implementation of federal and state fraud and abuse laws  including anti kickback laws and false claims laws 
to the extent that our products receive government reimbursement  we are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse  including anti kickback laws and false claims laws 
violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and or civil sanctions  including  in some instances  imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs  including medicare  medicaid  and veterans health programs 
we have not been challenged by a governmental authority under any of these laws and believe that our operations are in compliance with such laws 
health care fraud and abuse regulations are complex  and even minor  inadvertent irregularities can potentially give rise to claims that the law has been violated 
any violations of these laws could result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if there is a change in law  regulation or administrative or judicial interpretations  we may have to change our business practices or our existing business practices could be challenged as unlawful  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and 
table of contents results of operations 
we could become subject to false claims litigation under federal or state statutes  which can lead to civil money penalties  criminal fines and imprisonment  and or exclusion from participation in federal health care programs 
these false claims statutes include the federal false claims act  which allows any person to bring suit alleging the false or fraudulent submission of claims for payment under federal programs or other violations of the statute and to share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement 
such suits  known as qui tam actions  have increased significantly in recent years and have increased the risk that companies like us may have to defend a false claim action 
we could also become subject to similar false claims litigation under state statutes 
if we are unsuccessful in defending any such action  such action may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are dependent on a limited number of specialty suppliers of certain raw materials  and our business and financial results could be harmed if a specialty supplier no longer provides materials to us 
our ability to manufacture vitoss  vitagel and cortoss and to have vitoss foam manufactured by and for us is dependent on a limited number of specialty suppliers of certain raw materials 
we have a single source supplier for thrombin  a requisite raw material in our vitagel product 
the failure of a supplier to continue to provide us with these materials at a price or quality acceptable to us  or at all  would have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture these products 
moreover  our failure to maintain strategic reserve supplies of each significant single sourced material used to manufacture vitoss  cortoss and certain products that we may develop in the future may result in a breach of our material financing agreement with royalty trust 
although we believe that we maintain good relationships with our suppliers  we cannot assure that such supplies and services will continue to be available with respect to our current and future commercialized products 
we have a supply agreement which provides bovine collagen for the manufacture of vitagel 
the initial term of the supply agreement expires in august  however  we received notice in the first quarter of from our supplier of its intent to cease production of bovine collagen between january  and june  and either close or sell its collagen processing facility by december  while we are seeking to obtain a strategic collagen reserve for vitagel  there is no assurance that we will be successful 
the occurrence of any of the following could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture and sell vitagel and cellpaker  which is approved for use only in conjunction with vitagel our inability to find an alternative supplier with acceptable prices  quality and requisite regulatory approvals  our inability to obtain a strategic reserve of this collagen sufficient to meet our anticipated sales requirements  our inability to obtain collagen supply from this manufacturing facility if it is sold  or 
table of contents delays caused by the need to secure pma approval of a new manufacturing facility for the raw material 
if we are unable to sell vitagel and cellpaker for a period of time  our customers may seek alternative products and we may lose market share for vitagel and cellpaker 
further  there is no assurance that we will regain any vitagel and cellpaker market share that may be lost 
moreover  a delay or inability to sell vitagel and cellpaker could result in an impairment charge to our intangible asset represented by the then remaining balance of our original  prepayment of the profit sharing license royalties on sales of vitagel and cellpaker 
we prepaid the royalties on december  and the term of our license for these products is scheduled to expire july  we also cannot assure that supply agreements will be sufficient to meet our own needs and angiotech s needs if angiotech elects to be supplied by us under our license agreement with them 
under our license agreement with angiotech  in the future we may be obligated  under certain circumstances  to provide costasis an angiotech branded vitagel product and certain costasis materials to angiotech 
our current supply contract may not permit us to supply materials to angiotech or may otherwise be inadequate  and we may need to seek additional suppliers for costasis materials 
we are dependent on a limited number of specialized manufacturing suppliers for certain products  and our business and financial results could be harmed if a third party manufacturer fails to supply us with these products 
we are dependent upon kensey and other third party manufacturers for the supply of certain products 
our vitoss is converted to vitoss foam by kensey  our development partner 
we also manufacture certain delivery accessory products through third party specialty suppliers 
there is no assurance that these manufacturers will continue to supply our requirements 
if they fail to do so  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to engage another supplier for these products on a timely basis and on acceptable terms 
a delay in our ability to obtain adequate supplies of these products may negatively impact our product sales 
our pivotal cortoss trial may not yield supportive or sufficient data  which may delay or preclude fda clearance for commercial distribution of this product 
the fda granted approval to conduct our pivotal trial for cortoss in november in this trial we are studying cortoss for use in vertebral augmentation 
we began enrollment in and completed enrollment in the first quarter of the protocol for the trial contemplates a month follow up period for each patient  and we may be required to complete the follow up period for all enrolled patients in order to submit a k submission 
the completion of our pivotal trial and submission package for cortoss may be delayed or terminated for many reasons  including  but not limited to subjects are not followed up at the rate we currently expect  subjects experience an unacceptable rate or severity of adverse side effects  third party clinical investigators do not perform our pivotal trial on our anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol  good clinical practice and regulatory requirements  or other third party organizations do not perform data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner  inspections of our clinical trial sites by the fda or institutional review boards  or irbs  find regulatory violations that require us to undertake corrective action  suspend or terminate one or more sites  or prohibit us from using some or all of the data in support of our fda submission  
table of contents changes in laws  governmental regulations or administrative actions force us to modify the conduct of our trials or otherwise create unexpected burdens  the interim results of our clinical trials are inconclusive or negative  one or more of our irbs suspends or terminates our trial at an investigational site or withdraws its approval of our trial  one or more of our clinical investigators withdraws from our trial or deviates from our approved protocol  or third parties  investigators and service providers involved with our pivotal trial do not perform as contractually required or expected 
if one or more of the foregoing problems occur  it may delay or prevent us from obtaining clearance of the cortoss product 
if we fail to obtain and maintain the regulatory approvals or clearances necessary to make or sell our products  sales could be delayed or never realized 
the jurisdictions in which we seek to market our products will regulate these products as medical devices 
in most circumstances  we and our distributors and agents must obtain regulatory clearances  approvals and certifications and otherwise comply with extensive regulations regarding safety  quality and efficacy standards 
these regulations vary from country to country  and the regulatory review can be lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
we may not obtain or maintain the regulatory clearances  approvals and certifications necessary to make or market our products in our targeted markets 
moreover  regulatory clearances  approvals and certifications that are obtained may involve significant restrictions on the anatomic sites and types of procedures for which our products can be used 
in addition  we may be required to incur significant costs in obtaining or maintaining our regulatory clearances  approvals and certifications 
if we do not obtain or maintain regulatory clearances  approvals and certifications to enable us to make or market our products in the us or elsewhere  or if the clearances  approvals and certifications are subject to significant restrictions  we may never generate significant revenues 
the regulatory requirements in some of the jurisdictions where we currently market or intend to market our products are summarized below 
united states regulation by fda 
the fda regulates the clinical testing  manufacturing  labeling  distribution and promotion of medical devices 
to date  we have received k clearance from the fda to market our vitoss  vitoss foam and imbibe labels 
during and  we received approval from the fda to conduct two pilot clinical studies in the us to study the use of cortoss in vertebral augmentation 
the two pilot clinical studies are fully enrolled and we expect those trials to be completed by the third quarter of during  we received approval from the fda to conduct a pivotal clinical study in the us to further study the use of 
table of contents cortoss in vertebral augmentation using the vertebroplasty surgical technique 
we completed patient enrollment of the pivotal clinical study in february there can be no assurance that the data from these clinical trials will support fda clearance to market this product for the designated use 
we are currently manufacturing vitoss  vitagel  cellpaker and cortoss in the us  distributing vitoss  vitagel and imbibe in the us  and distributing vitoss  cortoss and aliquot outside the us we are manufacturing imbibe and aliquot in the us through outside third party contract manufacturers 
in addition  under our agreement with kensey  kensey has the exclusive right to manufacture any approved or cleared jointly developed products under the agreement 
this right extends until february for the vitoss foam product platform 
vitoss and vitagel  as well as any other products that we manufacture or distribute following their approval or clearance by the fda  will be subject to extensive regulation by the fda 
if safety or efficacy problems occur after the product reaches the market  the fda may impose severe limitations on the use of the product 
moreover  modifications to the approved or cleared product may require the submission of a new k notification or premarket approval application or premarket application supplement 
we may not be successful in obtaining approval to market the modified product in a timely manner  if at all 
noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in  among other things  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  failure of the government to grant premarket clearance or premarket approval for devices  withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecution 
medical devices may be marketed only for the indications for which they are approved or cleared 
the fda may not approve or clear indications that are necessary or desirable for successful commercialization 
indeed  the fda may refuse our requests for k clearance or premarket approval of new products  new intended uses or modifications to existing products 
our clearances can be revoked if safety or effectiveness problems develop 
european union and other international markets general 
international sales of medical devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country in which the products are sold 
accordingly  the introduction of our products in markets outside the united states will be subject to regulatory approvals or clearances in those jurisdictions 
the regulatory review process varies from country to country 
many countries also impose product standards  packaging and labeling requirements and import restrictions on medical devices 
in addition  each country has its own tariff regulations  duties and tax requirements 
the approval or clearance by foreign government authorities is uncertain and can be expensive 
our ability to market our products could be substantially limited due to delays in receipt of  or failure to receive  the necessary approvals or clearances 
requirement of ce certification in the european union 
to market a product in the european union  we must be entitled to affix a ce mark  an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance with applicable european medical device directives 
a ce 
table of contents certification enables us to market a product in all of the countries of the european union  as well as in other countries  such as switzerland and israel  that have mutual recognition agreements with the eu or have adopted the european union s regulatory standards 
to date  we have received a ce certification for the use of vitoss as a bone void filler and for the use of cortoss in screw augmentation and vertebral augmentation procedures 
there can be no assurance that we will receive ce certifications for cortoss for any other indications for use or that we will receive ce certifications for other products  including vitagel 
after clearance or approval of our products  we are subject to continuing regulation by the fda  and if we fail to comply with fda regulations  our business could suffer 
even after clearance or approval of a product  we are subject to continuing regulation by the fda  including the requirements that our facility be registered and our devices listed with the agency 
we are subject to medical device reporting regulations  which require us to report to the fda if our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunction in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur 
we must report corrections and removals to the fda where the correction or removal was initiated to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act caused by the device that may present a risk to health  and maintain records of other corrections or removals 
the fda closely regulates promotion and advertising 
the fda and state authorities have broad enforcement powers 
our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the fda or state agencies  which may include any of the following sanctions untitled letters  warning letters  fines  injunctions  consent decrees and civil penalties  repair  replacement  refunds  recall or seizure of our products  operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production  refusing or delaying our requests for k clearance or premarket approval of new products or new intended uses  withdrawing k clearance or premarket approvals that have already been granted  and criminal prosecution 
if any of these events were to occur  they could harm our business 

table of contents the difficulties of operating in international markets may harm sales of our products 
the international nature of our business subjects us and our representatives  agents and distributors to the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they operate  and in which our products are sold 
the types of risks that we face in international operations include the imposition of governmental controls  logistical difficulties in managing international operations  and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
our international sales and operations may be limited or disrupted if we cannot successfully meet the challenges of operating internationally 
if we fail to meet our obligations under a revenue sharing agreement  we may be required to repurchase from an investor its right to receive revenues on certain of our product sales  and the investor could foreclose on certain assets that are essential to our operations 
during october  we completed a  product development and equity financing with paul capital royalty acquisition fund  lp  which was subsequently assigned to royalty trust 
in this financing  we sold royalty trust a revenue interest and shares of our common stock 
the revenue interest agreement provides for royalty trust to receive on the first  of annual sales  reducing to of annual sales in excess of  of certain of our products  including vitoss  cortoss and any structural bioactive device  in north america and europe through  subject to certain adjustments 
this revenue interest percentage is subject to increase to a maximum rate of on that portion of product sales that specifically relates to vitoss and cortoss if we fail to meet contractually specified levels of annual net sales of products for which royalty trust is entitled to receive its revenue interest 
since we failed to meet the specified annual net sales levels  royalty trust received on that portion of product sales that specifically related to vitoss and cortoss during  and we do not currently expect that changes in the revenue interest percentage resulting from fluctuations in sales of products subject to the revenue interest will have a material effect on operating results for a period when considered relative to sales of the products for that period 
throughout the term of the royalty trust revenue interest agreement  we are required to make advance payments on the revenue interest obligation at the beginning of each year 
the amount of the advance payment is  in each of the years through while we believe that we will have sufficient cash at the end of to make the required  advance payment to royalty trust during  we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient cash to meet our advance payment obligations for the years through advance payments impact cash flow when made  and they affect earnings only as the advance payments are credited within each period against the revenue interest actually earned by royalty trust during that year  with any excess advance payments refunded to us shortly after the end of the year 
our obligation to pay the revenue interest is secured by our licenses  patents and trademarks relating to certain of our products  including vitoss  cortoss and any structural bioactive device  in north america and europe  the royalty interest we pay to one of our wholly owned subsidiaries on the sales of our products  and the shares of common stock of one 
table of contents of our wholly owned subsidiaries collectively  the pledged assets 
we are also required to maintain cash  cash equivalent and investment balances equal to or greater than the product of i and ii total operating losses  net of non cash charges  for the preceding fiscal quarter  and total shareholders equity of at least  provided  however  that under the provisions of the agreement with royalty trust  when calculating shareholders equity for the purposes of the financial covenants  the revenue interest obligation is included in shareholders equity at its carrying value 
as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants  and we do not expect to be out of compliance with the financial covenants within the next twelve months 
however  if we fail to maintain such balances and shareholders equity  royalty trust can demand that we repurchase its revenue interest 
in addition to the failure to comply with the financial covenants described above  the occurrence of certain events  including those set forth below  triggers royalty trust s right to require us to repurchase its revenue interest a judicial decision that has a material adverse effect on our business  operations  assets or financial condition  the acceleration of our obligations or the exercise of default remedies by a secured lender under certain debt instruments  a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy that involves us or our wholly owned subsidiary  vita special purpose corp  our insolvency  a change in control of our company  and the breach of a representation  warranty or certification made by us in the agreements with royalty trust that  individually or in the aggregate  would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business  operations  assets or financial condition  and such breach is not cured within days after notice thereof from royalty trust 
in addition  our failure to maintain strategic reserve supplies of each significant single source material used to manufacture vitoss  cortoss and certain products that we may develop in the future may result in a breach of our material financing agreement with royalty trust 
we may not have sufficient cash funds to repurchase the revenue interest upon a repurchase event 
the exact amount of the repurchase price is dependent upon certain factors  including when the repurchase event occurs 
if a repurchase event had been triggered and royalty trust exercised its right to require us to repurchase its revenue interest as of december   we would have owed royalty trust approximately the repurchase price for royalty trust s revenue interest as of a given date is calculated in three steps 
first  a specified annual rate of return effective october  is applied to royalty trust s  original purchase price from october  to the date of determination of the repurchase price 
second  the result obtained from the first step of the calculation is added to the original  purchase price 
third  the sum obtained from the 
table of contents second step of the calculation is reduced by both  and the actual amount of revenue interest paid during the specified period 
if we were unable to repurchase the revenue interest upon a repurchase event  royalty trust could foreclose on the pledged assets  and we could be forced into bankruptcy 
royalty trust could also foreclose on the pledged assets if we became insolvent or involved in a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy proceeding 
no repurchase events or foreclosures have occurred as of december  in the event that we repurchased royalty trust s revenue interest  royalty trust would have no obligation to surrender the shares of our common stock that it had purchased as part of the revenue interests assignment transaction 
our results of operations may fluctuate due to factors out of our control  which could cause volatility in our stock price 
vitoss  vitagel  cellpaker  imbibe  cortoss and aliquot are currently our only products that have received regulatory clearances or approvals for sale 
vitoss is cleared for sale in the us and the european union 
vitagel  cellpaker and imbibe are cleared for sale in the us cortoss and aliquot are cleared for sale in the european union 
we launched vitagel and cellpaker in after initially receiving rights to sell these products under a distribution agreement in we currently sell vitagel and cellpaker under a license agreement  the termination of which would have a material adverse effect on our sales revenues 
future levels of vitoss  vitagel  cortoss  aliquot  cellpaker and imbibe product sales are difficult to predict 
vitoss  vitagel and cellpaker product sales to date may not be indicative of future sales levels 
vitoss  cortoss and aliquot sales levels in europe may fluctuate due to seasonality of elective surgeries and the timing of any distributor stocking orders and vitoss  vitagel  imbibe and cellpaker sales levels may fluctuate in the us due to seasonality of elective surgeries and the timing of orders from hospitals 
our results of operations may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a number of additional factors  many of which are outside of our control 
these factors include  but are not limited to the timing of governmental approvals or clearances for our products and our competitors products  unanticipated events associated with clinical and pre clinical trials of our products  the medical community s acceptance of our products  the timing in obtaining adequate third party reimbursement of our products  the success of competitive products  our ability to enter into strategic alliances with other companies  expenses associated with development and protection of intellectual property matters  establishment of commercial scale manufacturing capabilities  events affecting logistics and elective surgery trends  the timing of expenses related to commercialization of new products  competitive disruptions to our distribution channels  the adequate training of a sufficient number of surgeons in the use of our products  pending or threatened offers to acquire us  and timing of governmental approvals or clearances for us to manufacture the products we sell 

table of contents the results of our operations may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and may not meet expectations of securities analysts and investors 
this may cause our stock price to be volatile 
our business will be damaged if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights to our products  and we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims by others 
we rely on patent protection  as well as a combination of copyright  trade secret and trademark laws  nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology 
however  these measures afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights 
for example  our patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented by third parties 
as of february   we own or control eighteen issued us patents and nineteen pending patent applications in the us  and several counterparts of certain of these patents and pending patent applications worldwide  including canada  europe  mexico and japan 
there can be no assurance that patents will issue from any of the pending patent applications 
moreover  we cannot be certain that we were the first creator of inventions covered by pending patent applications or we were the first to file patent applications for the relevant inventions for the following reasons patent applications filed prior to december in the us are maintained in secrecy until issued  patent applications filed after november in the us are maintained in secrecy until eighteen months from the date of filing  and the publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries 
if we do receive a patent  it may not be broad enough to protect our proprietary position in the technology or to be commercially useful to us 
in addition  if we lose any key personnel  we may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or other trade secrets by those former employees 
furthermore  the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us finally  even if our intellectual property rights are adequately protected  litigation or other proceedings may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  which could result in substantial costs to us and result in a diversion of management attention 
if our intellectual property is not adequately protected  our competitors could use the intellectual property that we have developed to enhance their products and compete more directly with us  which could damage our business 
in addition to the risk of failing to adequately protect our proprietary rights  there is a risk that we may become subject to a claim that we infringe upon the proprietary rights of others 
although we do not believe that we are infringing the rights of others  third parties may claim that we are doing so 

table of contents there is a substantial amount of litigation over patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry generally  and in the spinal market segments particularly 
if the holder of patents brought an infringement action against us  the cost of litigating the claim could be substantial and divert management attention 
in addition  if a court determined that one of our products infringed a patent  we could be prevented from selling that product unless we could obtain a license from the owner of the patent 
a license may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
modification of our products or development of new products to avoid infringement may require us to conduct additional clinical trials for these new or modified products and to revise our filings with the fda  which is time consuming and expensive 
if we were not successful in obtaining a license or redesigning our product  our business could suffer 
we have obtained certain of our intellectual property rights and our rights to develop and commercialize certain products  and made certain commitments regarding our intellectual property and these rights  through license and development agreements with third parties 
these agreements generally may be terminated by our counterparty if we materially breach any of our obligations under the agreement 
we may disagree with outside parties as to our and their obligations under the agreement or the interpretation of provisions in the agreement 
any such disagreements could cause the other party to seek to terminate our rights under the particular agreement 
if any of our agreements were terminated  we could lose the rights to the product  product candidate or intellectual property covered by the agreement  reducing our potential revenues and significantly harming our business 
whether or not such a termination were proper  if a dispute arises under any of our agreements  the need to resolve the dispute could take significant resources and divert management s time and attention 
if we cannot keep up with technological changes and marketing initiatives of competitors  sales of our products may be harmed 
extensive research efforts and rapid technological change characterize the market for products in the orthopedic market 
we anticipate that we will face intense competition from medical device  medical products and pharmaceutical companies 
for instance  the use of bone morphogenic proteins  or bmps  in orthopedic surgery has increased significantly in the past five years 
in addition  several pmma bone cements have received k clearance since for vertebral augmentation of vcfs 
further  in  the spinal bone grafting market saw the introduction of total disk replacement devices tdrs as treatment alternative for degenerative disc disease designed to preserve the motion of the vertebrae of the spine 
our products could be rendered noncompetitive or obsolete by these and other competitors technological advances 
we may be unable to respond to technological advances through the development and introduction of new products 
moreover  many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  sales  distribution  manufacturing and technological resources than us 
these competitors may be in the process of seeking fda or other regulatory approvals or clearances  or patent protection  for competitive products 
our competitors could  therefore  commercialize competing products in advance of our products 
they may also enjoy substantial advantages over us in terms of research and development expertise  experience in conducting clinical trials  
table of contents experience in regulatory matters  manufacturing efficiency  name recognition  sales and marketing expertise  established distribution channels  and established relationships with health care providers and payors 
these advantages may adversely affect our plans for market acceptance of our products 
we may acquire technologies or companies in the future  and these acquisitions could result in dilution to our shareholders and disruption of our business 
entering into an acquisition could divert management attention 
we also could fail to assimilate the acquired company  which could lead to higher operating expenses 
finally  our shareholders could be diluted if we issue shares of our stock to acquire another company or technology 
provisions of pennsylvania law or our articles of incorporation may deter a third party from seeking to obtain control of us or may affect your rights as a shareholder 
certain provisions of pennsylvania law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  or could discourage a third party from attempting to acquire us 
these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
in addition  our articles of incorporation enable our board of directors to issue up to  shares of preferred stock having rights  privileges and preferences as are determined by the board of directors 
accordingly  our board is empowered  without shareholder approval  to issue preferred stock with dividend  liquidation  conversion  voting or other rights superior to those of our common shareholders 
for example  an issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of the common shareholders  make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of us  discourage bids for our common stock at a premium  or otherwise adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
our stock price may be volatile 
our stock price  like that of many small cap medical technology companies  may be volatile 
in general  equity markets  including nasdaq  have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the following factors could also cause our stock price to be volatile or decrease fluctuations in our results of operations  under performance in relation to analysts estimates or financial guidance provided by us  changes in the financial guidance we provide to the investment community  changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding our stock  
table of contents announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  issues in establishing commercial scale manufacturing capabilities  disruptions with the manufacturing of our products  including with respect to our third party manufacturers and suppliers of raw materials  unanticipated events associated with clinical and pre clinical trials  fda and international regulatory actions regarding us or our competitors  determinations by governments and insurance companies regarding reimbursement for medical procedures using our or our competitors products  the medical community s acceptance of our products  product sales growth rates  difficulties in establishing and expanding our sales and distribution channels  disruptions to our sales and distribution channels as a result of competitive market changes  product recalls  developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights  public concern as to the safety of products developed by us or by others  changes in health care policy in the united states and internationally  acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors  business conditions affecting other medical device companies or the medical device industry generally  general market conditions  particularly for companies with small market capitalizations  and pending or threatened offers to acquire us 
if we are sued in a product liability action  we could be forced to pay substantial damages and the attention of our management team may be diverted from operating our business 
we manufacture medical devices that are used on patients in surgery  and we may be subject to a product liability lawsuit 
in particular  the market for spine products has a history of product liability litigation 
under certain of our agreements with our distributors  sales agencies and hospital customers  we indemnify the distributor  sales agency or hospital from product liability claims 
any product liability claim brought against us  with or without merit  could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates or the inability to secure coverage in the future 
in addition  we would have to pay any amount awarded by a court in excess of policy limits 
we maintain product liability insurance in the annual aggregate amount of up to  although our insurance policies have various exclusions 
thus  we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no insurance coverage  in which case we may have to pay the entire amount of any award 
even in the absence of a claim  our insurance rates may rise in the future to a point where we may decide not to carry this insurance 
a meritless or unsuccessful product liability claim would be time consuming and expensive to defend and could result in the diversion of management s attention from our core business 
a successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us in excess of our coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business could suffer if we cannot attract and retain the services of key employees 
we depend substantially upon the continued service and performance of our existing executive officers 
we rely on key personnel in formulating and implementing our product research  
table of contents development and commercialization strategies 
our success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees 
we compete for such personnel with other companies  academic institutions  government entities and other organizations 
we may not be successful in hiring or retaining qualified personnel 
if one or more of our key employees resigns  the loss of that employee could harm our business 
if we lose any key personnel  we may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or other trade secrets by those former employees  despite our use of confidentiality agreements 
we have modified some of our products without fda clearance 
the fda could retroactively determine that the modifications were improper and require us to stop marketing and recall the modified products until such clearance was obtained 
any modification to an fda cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness  or that would constitute a major change in its intended use  requires a new k clearance  any change that affects the safety or effectiveness of a pma approved device requires a premarket approval supplement 
we have made modifications to some of our products in the past  and may make additional modifications in the future that we believe  based upon fda s regulations and guidance  do not or will not require additional clearances or approvals 
if the fda disagrees  we could be required to obtain new clearances or approvals for the modifications 
we also may be required to recall and to stop marketing modified products until such clearance or approval is obtained  which could harm our operating results 
we may be required to submit extensive pre clinical and clinical data to support these supplementary submissions  depending on the nature of the changes 
we may not be able to obtain additional k clearances or premarket approvals for modifications to  or additional indications for  our existing products in a timely fashion  or at all 
delays in obtaining future clearances or approvals would adversely affect our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner  which in turn would harm our revenue and operating results 
if we fail to comply with the fda s quality system regulation  our manufacturing operations could be halted  and our business would suffer 
we are currently required to demonstrate and maintain compliance with the fda s quality system regulation  or qsr 
the qsr is a complex regulatory scheme that covers the methods and documentation of the design  testing  control  manufacturing  labeling  quality assurance  packaging  storage and shipping of our products 
the fda enforces the qsr through periodic unannounced inspections 
we have been  and anticipate in the future being  subject to such inspections 
our failure to comply with the qsr or to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse qsr inspection could result in enforcement actions  including a public warning letter  a shutdown of or restrictions on our manufacturing operations  delays in approving or clearing a product  refusal to permit the import or export of our products  a recall or seizure of our products  fines  injunctions  civil or criminal penalties  or other sanctions  any of which could cause our business and operating results to suffer

advance payment to royalty trust 
throughout the term of the royalty trust revenue interest agreement  we are required to make advance payments to royalty trust on the revenue interest obligation at the beginning of each year 
the amount of the advance payment is  in each of the years through we paid the  advance payment in january we believe that we will have sufficient cash at the end of to make the required  advance payment to royalty trust for see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information

see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information on future minimum rental payments under operating leases 
in addition  we may hire additional direct sales representatives to support not only the growth of our existing products  but to plan ahead for the possible clearance and commercial launch of cortoss in the us while we believe that our investment in our sales force may also bring opportunities to in license or distribute additional products  we expect to continue spending for research and development for new products 
we expect to raise additional capital from external sources in order to support the expansion of our sales force and fund operations 
cortoss clinical study and research and development we expect to incur approximately million in external costs during and in the completion of the cortoss pivotal clinical study in the us following completion of patient enrollment for the study in february  we will monitor the patients and collect  consolidate and analyze the clinical data in preparation for our submission of the cortoss k filing to the fda

expansion of manufacturing capacity we expect to spend approximately million for plant renovations and equipment during to expand our capacity to manufacture vitagel and ancillary products such as aliquot  imbibe and cellpaker  at sites we currently lease 
we plan to finance the renovations and equipment through cash on hand  borrowings and capital leases under an equipment line of credit 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents  and investments of  as of december  will be sufficient to meet our currently estimated operating and investing requirements into at least the second quarter of we plan to seek to obtain additional funds at any time through equity or debt financings  or strategic alliances with third parties either alone or in combination with equity or debt financings 
we will consider a variety of factors  such as availability of capital  opportunity to raise capital  the business goals of potential strategic partners and other third parties  and market conditions  in determining when to seek to raise these additional funds 
on february   we sold our assets associated with the endoskeleton ta vertebral body replacement structural device product line for  as a result of the sale  we no longer manufacture or sell endoskeleton products 
we recorded revenues for the years ended december   and of   and  respectively  for sales of endoskeleton products 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
by their nature  these assumptions  estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we use authoritative pronouncements  historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the critical accounting policies addressed below have been reviewed with the audit committee and reflect our most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is not recognized until persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  performance has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
in the us  product sales revenue is recognized upon either receipt of documentation from the customer indicating their consumption of product from consigned inventory or shipment of purchased product to the customer 
outside the us  revenue from product sales is primarily recognized upon receipt of our product by our independent stocking distributors 
outside of the us  we do not allow product returns or exchanges 
we have no obligations to our customers once title has been transferred 
both our us customers and our independent stocking distributor 
table of contents customers outside of the us are generally required to pay on a net day basis and payment discounts are not offered 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an accounts receivable allowance for an estimated amount of losses that may result from a customer s failure to pay for product purchased 
we analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations and changes in customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate and result in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value using the first in first out basis  or fifo 
a provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventories to the estimated net realizable values  if required 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs  the costs of producing inventory in the reporting periods prior to the receipt of regulatory approval or clearance are recorded as research and development expense 
revenue interest obligation during october  we completed a  product development and equity financing with paul capital royalty acquisition fund  lp  which was subsequently assigned to royalty securitization trust i royalty trust 
in march  we amended the original financing  which resulted in a one time increase to the revenue interest obligation of  increasing the balance of the revenue interest obligation to  the revenue interest obligation is accounted for in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issues no 
 sales of future revenues 
the products that are subject to the revenue interest have only been approved or cleared and marketed for the past several years or are still under development 
for these reasons  as of december  and for the foreseeable future  we cannot currently make a reasonable estimate of future revenues and payments that may become due to royalty trust under this financing 
therefore  it is premature to estimate the expected impact of this financing on our results of operations  liquidity and financial position 
accordingly  given these uncertainties  we have charged and  for the foreseeable future  we will continue to charge revenue interest expense for the revenue interest due to royalty trust as revenues subject to the revenue interest obligation are recognized see note 
revenue interest expense of   and  has been recorded for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the revenue interest under this agreement is treated as interest expense in accordance with eitf no 

table of contents income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with an asset and liability approach requiring the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded without consideration as to their ability to be realized 
the deferred tax asset includes net operating loss and credit carry forwards  and the cumulative temporary differences related to certain research and patent costs  which have been charged to expense in our consolidated statements of operations but have been recorded as assets for tax return purposes 
the portion of any deferred tax asset  for which it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized  must then be offset by recording a valuation allowance against the asset 
since it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized against all of our deferred tax assets due to our history of operating losses  a valuation allowance has been established against all of our deferred tax assets 
accounting for stock options issued to employees in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r 
this statement revised sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
 and required companies to expense the value of employee stock options and similar awards 
the effective date of this standard for the company was january  under sfas no 
r  we are required to expense stock options in our consolidated statements of operations 
we have selected the black scholes option pricing model  on a modified prospective transition method  as permitted by sfas no 
r  and therefore have not restated our financial results for prior periods 
under this transition method  stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  includes the remaining compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  january  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
these amounts are being amortized based upon a graded vesting schedule in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans 
stock based compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted to employees subsequent to january  is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r and amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we applied the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
 and related interpretations to account for our stock option plans 
under this method  compensation expense was computed and recorded on the date of grant for the intrinsic value related to stock options granted  reflected by the difference between the option exercise price and the fair market value of the underlying shares of common stock on the date of grant 
accordingly  because the exercise price of our employee stock options equaled the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense was recognized 
the company s board of directors approved the acceleration of vesting for all out of the money unvested stock options held by current employees  officers or directors on november  under the company s stock option plan and amended and restated equity 
table of contents compensation plan 
an option was considered out of the money if the stated exercise price was greater than per share  the closing sale price of the company s common stock on november  as a result of this action  vesting of options to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock were accelerated 
the decision to accelerate the vesting of these options was made primarily to reduce compensation expense that might be recorded in future periods following our adoption of sfas no 
r 
the pro forma table for the years ended december  and set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements includes this acceleration 
if vesting of these options had not been accelerated  expense related to these options would have been as follows  in   in   in and  in accounting for derivative liability associated with non employee stock options historically  the common stock purchase options that we granted to non employee consultants as compensation for services rendered were fully vested on the date of the grant 
upon adoption of sfas no 
r  during the service and vesting period  these options are accounted for under sfas no 
r 
however  once the service period terminates  these options are then accounted for in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for derivative instruments eitf no 
 from the date the service vesting period terminates through the expiration of the option or until it is exercised  whichever is earlier 
in certain circumstances  these awards may have to be settled in cash 
accordingly  effective january   we reclassified from equity to liabilities the aggregate black scholes value of our fully vested non employee consultant stock options that were outstanding as of january  in addition  we are required to record a fair value adjustment at the end of each quarter for the change in the black scholes value of our fully vested non employee consultant stock options outstanding 
our stock price may be volatile and may fluctuate 
since we cannot determine what our stock price will be at the end of future quarters  we cannot estimate the impact of eitf no 
on our consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statements of operations in the future 
an increase to our stock price as of the last day of a given quarter  as compared to our stock price as of the last day of the prior quarter  may result in an increase to the liability recorded to our consolidated balance sheet and an increase to operating expenses recorded in our consolidated statements of operations 
conversely  a decrease to our stock price as of the last day of a given quarter  as compared to our stock price as of the last day of the prior quarter  may have the opposite effect 
additionally  any subsequent changes to the assumptions used in the black scholes model to estimate the fair value of these non employee consultant options will impact the effect of eitf no 
on our consolidated balance sheet and consolidated results of operations 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have experienced negative operating cash flows since our inception and we have funded our operations primarily from the proceeds received from sales of our stock and other securities 
cash  cash equivalents and investments were  at december   and include  in net proceeds received in november and december from the sale of  shares of our common stock in a registered underwritten offering

table of contents operating cash outflows our operating cash outflows for the year ended december  have primarily been used to fund operations 
operational cash outflows include i headcount related costs to expand our field sales team  ii increased payment of sales commissions on growing product sales  iii purchases of product inventory from kensey nash corporation kensey  iv payment of the contractually required advance payment of  to paul royalty  and v the production of vitagel and cortoss inventory  and v expenses related to our clinical trial in the us for cortoss 
operating cash flow requirements outlook we expect to continue to focus our efforts on sales growth under our vitoss and vitagel product platforms in we launched vitoss cancellous chips and the vitagel spray set during the first quarter of in an effort to further increase sales of our new vitoss and vitagel product lines in future quarters  we may add direct sales representatives to our organization for those territories in the us where we either do not currently have independent sales agency coverage or the territory is underserved 
in addition  we intend to fund additional studies to collect and publish post clinical data relating to the performance of vitoss to support our marketing and sales efforts and to fund the expansion of our manufacturing capability 
additionally  we expect to continue to use cash  cash equivalents and investments to fund our operations until we are profitable  if ever 
we anticipate that our product sales will remain insufficient to support our present operations at expected spending levels 
we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for at least the next several years as we plan to continue to expand our sales and marketing activities  pursue product development efforts and further develop our manufacturing capabilities 
during  we expect our primary use of cash  cash equivalents and investments for research development activities will relate to costs associated with clinical trials in the us and research and development for cortoss 
we expect to incur approximately  in external costs during and in the completion of the cortoss pivotal clinical study in the us following completion of patient enrollment for the study in february  we will incur costs to monitor the patients and collect  consolidate and analyze the clinical data in preparation for our submission of the cortoss k filing to the fda 
we expect the expense for this clinical program to decrease significantly after the submission  if any  of an application to the fda for clearance to market cortoss in the us for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures 
however  the overall level of our research development expense in future periods will depend upon the development status and costs of products currently in our pipeline and any new products that we may determine to pursue 
we may also incur additional expense to support the launch of cortoss if it receives fda clearance 
our operating cash requirements are heavily dependent upon our product sales mix allocation among higher and lower margin products  the timing of receipt of fda k clearance for new products  the timing of inventory builds to support product launches and related inventory valuations  the timing of subsequent launches and acceptance of our new product lines  the rate 
table of contents at which we add new direct sales representatives and the rate at which our field sales network generates sales in their respective territories 
accordingly  in  our operating cash requirements will continue to be subject to quarterly volatility 
until such time that sales levels are sufficient to sustain operations  if ever  we expect to continue to use cash  cash equivalents and investments to fund operating activities and we expect to continue to need to sell securities to fund our operating activities 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to sell securities at a price that fully reflects the long term value  if any  of the investments we may make in building our sales force  expanding our manufacturing capability  creating manufacturing efficiencies  or developing and commercializing new products 
agreement with kensey 
as of december   we owed kensey  for manufactured product inventory and royalties  which are included in accounts payable and other accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet

as of december   we owed angiotech  for royalties  which is included in accounts payable and other accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet 
revenue interest 
the revenue interest agreement provides for royalty trust to receive on the first  of annual sales  reducing to of annual sales in excess of  of certain of our products  including vitoss  cortoss and any structural bioactive device  in north america and europe through  subject to certain adjustments 
this revenue interest percentage is subject to increase to a maximum rate of on that portion of product sales that specifically relates to vitoss and cortoss  if we fail to meet contractually specified levels of annual net sales of products for which royalty trust is entitled to receive its revenue interest 
since we failed to meet the specified annual net sales levels  royalty trust received on that portion of product sales that specifically related to vitoss and cortoss during  and throughout the term of the royalty trust revenue interest agreement  we are required to make advance payments on the revenue interest obligation at the beginning of each year 
in february  the revenue interest agreement with royalty trust was amended by mutual agreement to reduce the advance payment for from  to  in december  the revenue interest agreement with royalty trust was again amended by mutual agreement to reduce the advance payment for from  to  which was paid to royalty trust during january in january  we paid royalty trust the advance payment for of  the amount of the advance payment remains  in each of the years through while we believe that we will have sufficient cash at the end of to make the required  advance payment to royalty trust during  we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient cash to meet our advance payment obligations for the years through advance payments impact cash flow when made  and they affect earnings only as the advance payments are credited within each period against the revenue interest actually earned by royalty trust during that year  with any excess advance payments refunded to us shortly after the end of the year 
the products that are subject to the revenue interest agreement have been approved and launched at various times over the last four years or are still under development 
for these reasons  as of 
table of contents december   and for the foreseeable future  we cannot currently make a reasonable estimate of future revenues and payments that may become due to royalty trust under this financing 
our obligation to pay the revenue interest is secured by i licenses  patents and trademarks relating to certain of our products  including vitoss  cortoss and any structural device  in north america and europe  ii the royalty interest we pay to vita licensing  inc  our wholly owned subsidiary  on the sales of our products pursuant to a licensing arrangement  and iii the shares of common stock of vita special purpose corp 
owned by vita licensing  inc if we default under our agreement with royalty trust  vita special purpose corp 
cannot pay any dividends or make any distributions to us or vita licensing  inc as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the revenue interest agreement and do not expect to fall out of compliance for at least the next twelve months 
however  if we fail to maintain certain specified balances and shareholders equity  royalty trust can demand that we repurchase its revenue interest 
we may not have sufficient cash funds to repurchase the revenue interest upon a repurchase event 
the exact amount of the repurchase price is dependent upon certain factors  including when the repurchase event occurs 
if a repurchase event had been triggered and royalty trust exercised its right to require us to repurchase its revenue interest as of december   we would have owed royalty trust approximately  net cash used in investing activities investing cash inflows during and  we received proceeds of  and  respectively  from the sale of investments 
investing cash outflows in  we purchased the profit sharing royalty rights for vitagel and cellpaker for  accordingly  we will no longer pay angiotech royalties for vitagel product sales in and thereafter 
the  payment has been recorded as a license right intangible on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  this amount will be amortized based upon the greater of a straight line amortization through july   or b actual units sold in a given period in relation to the total estimated units to be sold over the expected life of the applicable patent  which is july  we have invested    for the years ended december    and  respectively  primarily for the purchase of equipment  leasehold improvements  and research and development equipment in order to further expand our product development and manufacturing capabilities relating to vitagel and vitoss

table of contents financing requirements outlook we do not expect sales to generate cash flow in excess of operating expenses for at least the next several years  if ever 
until such sales levels are achieved  we expect to continue to use cash  cash equivalents  and investments to fund operating and investing activities 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents  and investments of  as of december  will be sufficient to meet our currently estimated operating and investing requirements at least into the second quarter of we will seek to finance new capital investments through borrowings or capital leases under an equipment line of credit 
in addition  we may seek to finance our working capital needs through a line of credit  and plan to seek additional funds through equity or debt financings  or strategic alliances with third parties either alone or in combination with equity or debt financings 
we have an effective form s universal shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission for the potential additional issuance of up to approximately  of our securities  and plan to file another shelf registration statement 
the existing registration statement provides us with the flexibility to determine the type of security we choose to sell  including common stock  preferred stock  warrants and debt securities 
however  the filing of a registration statement does not insure that securities covered by the registration statement will  in fact  be sold  and we could sell securities in other transactions not registered on that registration statement 
moreover  if we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  the terms and prices for these financings may be more favorable to the new investors than the terms obtained by our existing shareholders 
these financings also may significantly dilute the ownership of existing shareholders 
if we raise additional capital by accessing debt markets  the terms of these financings may require liens on certain of our assets that may limit our flexibility 
additional equity or debt financing  however  may not be available on acceptable terms from any source
