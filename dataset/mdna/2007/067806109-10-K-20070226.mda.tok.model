these agreements further expanded barnes aerospace s long term position on oem and aftermarket aircraft engine parts 
the company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement in june which increased its available bank credit from million to million and permits borrowings in currencies other than the us dollar 
management objectives management is focused on three areas of development employee  process and strategy which in combination will generate long term value for its stockholders 
the company s strategies for growth include both organic growth from new products  services  markets and customers and growth from acquisitions 
our business barnes group consists of three operating segments barnes distribution  an international  full service vmi distributor of maintenance  repair  operating and production supplies  associated spring  a global provider of precision components for critical applications and one of the world s largest manufacturers of precision mechanical and nitrogen gas products  and barnes aerospace  a specialized manufacturer and repairer of highly engineered components and assemblies for aircraft engines  airframes and land based industrial gas turbines 
in each of these businesses  barnes group is among the leaders in the market niches it serves  and has highly recognized brands for many of the products it sells or manufactures 
key performance indicators management evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on the operating profit of the respective businesses  which includes net sales  cost of sales  selling and administrative expenses and certain 
table of contents components of other income and other expenses  as well as the allocation of corporate overhead expenses 
management also uses an internal measurement tool called ppat  or performance profit after tax 
ppat is an economic value added eva like metric that calculates operating profit after tax  less a charge for the capital employed by the business 
management utilizes ppat in economic decision making  such as capital expenditures  investments in growth initiatives  customer pricing decisions  and evaluation of acquisitions 
the goal of utilizing ppat is to create a mindset among all employees to use capital in the most efficient way possible and to link decisions to stockholder value creation 
in addition to ppat  which is a measurement tool common among each of the operating groups  each business has its own key performance indicators kpis  a number of which are focused on customer satisfaction 
in barnes distribution  kpis include daily sales average  or dsa  average order size  and fill rate  which is the percentage of order lines filled on the first pass from the distribution center assigned to that customer 
at associated spring  kpis include sales and orders per day  which together provide visibility on sales in the next days 
management tracks inventory turns and sales per employee to gauge efficiency  and measures on time delivery and the number of defective parts per million as means of evaluating quality and customer fulfillment 
at barnes aerospace  important kpis are customer orders and backlog  which are utilized to forecast how sales will develop over the next months 
in the oem operations  management closely tracks quality measurements and on time delivery to its customers 
in the aftermarket operations  management measures quality and turnaround time of overhauled or repaired parts returned to the customers 
key industry data in each business  management also tracks a variety of economic and industry data as indicators of the health of a particular sector 
at barnes distribution  the data includes the institute for supply management s pmi composite index the pmi and the federal reserve s industrial production index the ipi  which are monthly indicators of the health of us manufacturing activity 
management tracks similar indices in canada  france and the united kingdom and also utilizes the business conditions report of the precision metalforming association  which correlates well with demand for barnes distribution s raymond products 
for associated spring  key data include the ipi  durable goods orders  tooling build schedules  compressor build forecasts  the production of light vehicles  both in the us and globally  and capital investments in the telecommunications and electronics industries 
at barnes aerospace  for its oem operations  management regularly tracks orders and deliveries for each of the major aircraft manufacturers  as well as engine purchases made for new aircraft 
in the aftermarket operations  management monitors the number of aircraft in the active fleet  the number of planes temporarily or permanently taken out of service  aircraft utilization rates for the major airlines  shop visits  and traffic growth 
management also monitors annual appropriations for the us military related to new aircraft purchases and maintenance

table of contents other matters inflation inflation generally affects the company through its costs of labor  equipment and raw materials 
increases in the costs of these items have historically been offset by price increases  operating improvements  and other cost saving initiatives 
the company has periodically experienced inflation in raw material prices 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant accounting policies are disclosed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below 
actual results could differ from such estimates 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost  determined on a first in  first out fifo basis  or market 
provisions are made to reduce excess or obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable value 
loss provisions  if any  on contracts are established when estimable 
loss provisions are based on the projected excess of manufacturing costs over the net revenues of the products or group of related products under contract 
the process for evaluating the value of excess and obsolete inventory often requires the company to make subjective judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels  quantities and prices at which such inventory will be sold in the normal course of business 
accelerating the disposal process or incorrect estimates of future sales potential may necessitate future adjustments to these provisions 
business acquisitions assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination are recorded at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
at december   the company had million of goodwill  representing the cost of acquisitions in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired companies 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing annually or earlier testing if an event or change in circumstances indicates that the fair value of a reporting unit has been reduced below its carrying value 
the assessment of goodwill involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting units  as defined by sfas no 
management completed this annual assessment during the second quarter of based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment  which incorporated management assumptions about expected future cash flows 
based on this assessment  there was no goodwill impairment in future cash flows can be affected by changes in the global economy and local economies  industries and markets in which the company sells products or services  and the execution of management s plans  particularly with respect to integrating acquired companies 
there can be no assurance that future events will not result in impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets 
revenue sharing programs the company participates in aftermarket rsps under which the company receives an exclusive right to supply designated aftermarket parts over the life of the related aircraft engine program 
as consideration  the company pays participation fees  which are recorded as long lived intangible assets  and are recognized as a reduction to sales over the life of the program 
the recoverability of the intangible asset is subject to significant estimates about future revenues related to the program s aftermarket parts 
management updates revenue projections periodically  which includes comparing actual experience against projected revenue and obtaining industry projections 
the potential exists that actual revenues will not meet expectations due to a change in market conditions 
a shortfall in future revenues may indicate an impairment of the intangible asset 
the company evaluates the remaining useful life of this asset to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 
the intangible asset is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable

the company does not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 
the company s long term debt portfolio consists of fixed rate and variable rate instruments and is managed to reduce the overall cost of borrowing while also minimizing the effect of changes in interest rates on near term earnings
