item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a the company s md a is comprised of significant accounting estimates made in the normal course of its operations  overview of the company s business conditions  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources and contractual obligations 
the company did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and the company s significant accounting estimates identified are  revenue recognition  accounts receivables and inventory valuation 
the company is disclosing segment information for two segments 
the company has historically considered its operations to be comprised of one business segment 
however  due to the significance of its external sales of prepreg in the first quarter of  a trend which management believes will continue  the company believes its business to be comprised of two operating segments  composite products and composite materials 
the company began reporting two segments for the first quarter of composite products is comprised sales of golf shafts  hockey sticks and other composite products 
composite materials is comprised of external sales of prepreg products in the forms of uni tapes  fabrics and film adhesives along with contributions from its interest in cft 
significant accounting estimates the consolidated financial statements of the company are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  the company is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies  which the company believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  include the following revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from product sales at the time of shipment and passage of title 
we also offer certain of our customers the right to return shafts for breakage within a limited time after delivery 
we track such shaft returns  and we record a provision for the estimated amount of such future returns  based on historical experience and any notification we receive of pending returns at the time sales are made 
the company believes that any shafts returned for breakage will be returned within three years of the initial sale of the shaft 
the company estimates in regards to total actual returns  that will be returned in the first year after sale  in the second year after sale and the remaining in the third year after sale  assuming a mid year convention 
the company s breakage return rate has been between 
and breakage returns divided by sales dollars for the past ten years 
the company has historically utilized a four year moving average of the breakage return rate to record its estimated liability 
the four year average utilized in the accrual estimate as of december  is 
the company s breakage return rate has declined over the past years 
the highest four year average over the past ten years has been 
if the company were to use in estimating its liability as of december   it would have the effect of increasing the liability by approximately million  which would be recorded in cost of goods sold 
while such returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we have in the past 
any significant increase in product failure rates and the resulting returns could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns materialize 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within ou r expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
since our accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively few number of customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results 
the company estimates its allowance for doubtful accounts on a monthly basis  by reviewing all amounts owed to the company and focusing on those amounts that are greater than days past due 
the company reviews the customers that have amounts greater than days past due and where appropriate reserves for the receivable amount 
as of december   the company estimated this amount to be approximately  if the company were to reserve for the total amount greater than days past due  it would increase the allowanc e by approximately  which would be recorded in administrative expense 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
management of the company  including but not limited to  representatives from manufacturing  sales  acco unting and officers review the inventory reserve methodology quarterly and when appropriate  establish additional reserves or reduce existing reserves 
the company s reserve methodology consists of the following reviewing on hand inventories of our top customers and comparing inventories to historical sales trends and anticipated sales forecasts 
a reserve is established for all shafts that are deemed to be obsolete 
raw materials are reviewed based upon estimated future production and when appropriate  reserves are established 
shafts that are designated for rework parts that need additional work are reviewed and when appropriate reserves are established 
the final analysis is to review inactive inventory  and apply reserves to parts that were not included in the other analyses and have been inactive in the system for a period of twelve months 
 the company s average reserve percentage compared to gross inventory has been approximately for the past five years 
in the past five years  the highest reserve percentage was approximately and the lowest reserve percentage was approximately 
the company s reserve percentage as of december  is 
see the estimated impact below to cost of goods sold  utilizing the different reserve rates above amounts below in thousands highest average lowest gross inventory as of reserve rate a estimated reserve recorded reserve as of impact to costs of goods sold a this was the company s highest rate  the second highest rate in the past five years was 
in the future  if our inventory were determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventory is determined to be undervalued  we may have over reported our costs of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure that our forecasts of future product demands are reasonable  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
the increase in inventory in the current year was attributed to an increase in finished goods  with the majority of that increase being aldila branded shafts 
however  the company s reserve percentage as compared to gross inventories has remained consistent with prior year 
the company continues to look at ways of minimizing its inventory levels and to be more efficient 
as the company continues to try and reduce its carrying levels of its work in process and finished goods inventory  it should have the effect of further reducing the amount of its inventory reserves 
overview business conditions composite products the composite products segment is mainly comprised of graphite golf shafts and  to a lesser extent  hockey sticks 
the graphite shaft market consists of customized oem production shafts  both premium and value and aldila branded and co branded shafts 
the company sells customized oem production and co branded shafts directly to its oem customers and sells aldila branded shafts through the oem custom stock and custom fit programs and to distributors 
the company has re emerged over the past couple of years as an innovator in the branded segment of the business  in which shafts tend to sell at higher prices and gross margins than the customized oem production shafts sold to club manufacturers 
the company introduced the aldila nvtm in  featuring the company s exclusive micro laminate technology 
the nvtm has had numerous tour victories 
the company introduced nv line extensions in  including the nvs  nv protopype  pink nv  nv irons and nv hybrid shafts 
the company began shipping its newest shaft offering the vs prototm and the vs prototm hybrid in the vs prototm was used by the winner of the us open and is quickly becoming aldila s single most popular shaft model on tour 
as with the nv protopypetm  the vs prototm is a high performance shaft featuring carbon nanotubes as well as aerospace carbon fibers and aldila s exclusive high performance resin system 
in addition  the company unveiled the new vs prototm hybrid shaft for high end hybrid clubs 
the company s sales of the vs prototm shaft line have exceeded the first year sales of our nvtm shaft line over a comparable period of time 
in  pga tour  lpga tour and nationwide tour professionals using aldila nvtm or vs prototm shafts in their clubs have won a total of tour events 
the aldila vs prototm and nvtm hybrid shafts combined have been the number one hybrid shafts at every event this year on the pga tour  according to the darrell survey company 
in addition  aldila hybrid shafts won the annual golf magazine club test for forty club testers evaluated hybrid clubs for golf magazine and clubs featuring aldila hybrid shafts received the highest rating in every category for hybrid clubs 
overall the aldila shafts helped give the testers the best feel  playability  forgiveness and distance with their hybrids compared to the competition 
as the pga tour has began  aldila was once again the leading shaft manufacturer represented at the mercedes championship  winning both the wood and hybrid shaft count 
the company also recorded its first win of the year at the recent sony open with the winner using an aldila nvtm shafted driver 
paula creamer  who is a member of the aldila advisory staff  won the sbs open playing her customary pink nvtm 
the company believes that it will continue to be successful in the branded segment and has focused its marketing and advertising effort in support of this business 
the company continues to maintain a broad customer base in both the oem production shaft and branded shaft market segments and competes aggressively with both united states and foreign based shaft manufacturers for oem production shafts and branded shafts 
however  the company s sales have tended to be concentrated among a limited number of major club companies  thus making the company s results of operations dependent on those customers  their continued willingness to purchase a significant portion of their shafts from the company  and their success in selling clubs containing the company s shafts to their customers 
in  net sales to ping  acushnet company and callaway golf represented  and of the company s net sales  respectively  and the company anticipates that these companies will continue  collectively  to represent the largest portion of its sales in although it is generally difficult to predict in advance the success of any particular club or of any particular manufacturer  the company believes that it is protected to some extent from normal periodic fluctuations in sales among the various golf club companies by virtue of the broad range of its club manufacturer customers 
golf club companies regularly introduce new clubs  frequently containing innovations in design 
sometimes these new clubs achieve dramatic success in the marketplace  thus increasing the overall volatility of club sales among the major companies 
while the company seeks to have its shafts represented on as many major product introductions as possible  it can provide no assurance that its shafts will be included in any particular hot club or that sales of a hot club that does not include the company s shafts will not have a negative impact on the sales of those clubs that do 
the company s sales could also suffer a significant drop off from period to period to the extent that they may be dependent in any period on sales of one or more hot clubs  which then tail off in subsequent periods when no other club offers a high level of new sales to replace the lost sales 
during the s  the graphite golf shaft industry became increasingly competitive  placing extraordinary pressure on the selling prices of the company s golf shafts and adversely affecting its gross profit margins and level of profitability 
the company s average selling price decreased by from december  through december  the pressure was mainly attributed to the increased competition for oem production shafts  and a shift of our customers away from branded shafts to customized oem production shafts 
beginning in  the company was able to achieve higher average selling prices as it enjoyed increasing success in the branded segment of the business 
in late  the company began to see its oem customers choose co branded shafts for their stock offerings 
the introduction of co branded shafts and the continued success in the branded segment had the effect of increasing the company s average selling prices over the last few years 
the company s average selling price increased by approximately for the year ended december  as compared to the comparable period in however  the company s average selling price decreased by for the year ended december  as compared to the comparable period in the percentage of the total branded and co branded shaft revenue to total composite products revenue decreased to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  as the company s branded and co branded shafts typically sell at higher selling prices than oem production shafts  a significant change in product mix in any one period will have the effect of increasing or decreasing the average selling price of shafts sold 
in addition  increases in carbon fiber prices passed on to its customers will also have the effect of increasing average selling prices in the future 
the company s response to the pricing pressure it faced during the s  and continues to face in the oem production shaft segment  has been to vertically integrate  reduce its cost structure and to focus on continued penetration of the branded and co branded shaft segments 
the vertical integration began in when the company started manufacturing prepreg  the principal raw material in the manufacture of graphite golf shafts  at its facility in poway  california 
see composite materials 
in addition to the company s efforts to reduce its costs through vertical integration  the company also reduced its cost structure by shifting more of its shaft production to lower cost labor markets  such as mexico  china and in  vietnam 
in addition to golf shafts  the company also manufactures hockey sticks for one customer 
the company began manufacturing and selling hockey sticks in the company has not seen a significant increase in sales of hockey sticks and is not satisfied with current status of its hockey business 
the company does not see the hockey business as being material to the company in the future 
the percentage of hockey shaft revenue to total composite products revenue was for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  composite materials the composite materials segment is comprised of external sales of prepreg  film adhesives  fabrics and other materials and the contribution provided by the company s owned interest in cft 
the company has never tracked inter segment sales and has always looked at the contribution provided by composite materials based upon the external sales of materials 
the company records all shared cost to composite products and allocates certain costs for segment reporting  such as shipping  purchasing and other administrative costs based upon the net revenues of each segment 
costs that are specific to one segment are charged directly to the respective segment 
the company began the manufacture of composite materials in initially  the prepreg produced was mainly consumed by the composite products segment 
the company s external sales of prepreg and other materials have increased over the past several years 
sales of prepreg as a percentage of net sales were year ended december  as compared to for in the second half of  the company purchased a second resin filmer 
the addition of a second resin filmer provides additional supply of resin film  which is one of the key raw materials in the production of prepreg 
the increase in resin film capacity enables the company to add additional capacity to the company s prepreg composite manufacturing operations as well as provide increased capacity for film products 
in addition  it provides capacity protection should the company encounter problems with its other resin filmer 
the company has completed the installation of its sixth prepreg tape line  which enables it to support anticipated growth for shaft and prepreg sales 
in addition  an additional wide prepreg tape line will be installed late this year to add further capacity to support anticipated growth in this business segment 
the company continues to look for opportunities to sell its prepreg and film adhesive products to other fabricators of products manufactured from composite materials 
the company has achieved some success in these areas and management believes that growth opportunities in these areas will continue to exist 
in addition  management believes that vertical integration through its prepreg operation has been successful to date and is allowing the company to maintain  or in some cases enhance  its competitive position with respect to the major united states golf club companies that are its principal customers 
in addition to vertical integration through prepreg  the company established a manufacturing facility in evanston  wyoming for the production of carbon fiber in  which is a significant raw material used in the prepreg production process 
during and through the first ten months of  the company used the material from this facility to satisfy a significant portion of its internal demand for carbon fiber in the manufacturing of prepreg used for graphite shaft production 
during  the company also produced and sold carbon fiber from this facility to other unrelated entities for the manufacture of other carbon based products 
on october   sgl purchased a interest in the company s carbon fiber manufacturing operation 
the company and sgl entered into an agreement to operate the facility as a limited liability company with equal ownership interests between the venture members 
the company and sgl also entered into supply agreements with the new entity  cft  for the purchase of carbon fiber at cost plus an agreed upon mark up 
the company and sgl are each responsible to bear of the fixed costs to operate the facility as a term of this supply agreement 
the partners share profits and losses of cft equally 
the joint venture partners primarily consume the carbon fiber manufactured from this facility 
if the carbon fiber facility is not operated at high production levels  either because of production difficulties or because there is not enough demand by the joint venture owners to justify that level of production  the cost per unit of carbon fiber consumed by the company and thus the cost of producing the company s golf shafts and other products is increased due to spreading the fixed costs of production over smaller volumes 
if demand is lower than production capacity  cft also runs the risk of building up excess inventory 
given the relatively low costs historically in the market for carbon fiber and the highly competitive market for graphite golf shafts  the failure to operate at high levels could adversely affect the company s gross margins or its ability to maintain profitable competitive prices for its products 
although selling prices of carbon fiber had been depressed for the through mid period based on a surplus of supply in the market for carbon fiber  in the second half of the company began to see increases in carbon fiber prices and a constriction of supply of all types of carbon fiber not manufactured at cft 
if the prices continue to increase or if the company cannot obtain an adequate supply at a reasonable price  it could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
the company does not expect third party sales at cft to have a significant effect on either the company s profitability 
cft purchased substantially all of its raw acrylic fibers for the carbon fiber operation from one supplier for the years through previous to  the company purchased raw acrylic fibers from another supplier who in may  filed bankruptcy and announced its intention to cease producing acrylic fibers  which left cft in a true sole source position 
the assets of this previous supplier are now owned by china bluestar who continues to operate the business 
there is no certainty that china bluestar will be successful 
cft is continuing to pursue alternate sources of supply for this material and has run several trials with results that are encouraging 
the current supplier of precursor has recently notified cft that it does not intend to continue to supply precursor beyond late october cft management projects that precursor in inventory when supply ends from the current supplier should carry the operation through the first half of however  if the current supplier is unable to deliver and cft cannot qualify and source material from a new supplier prior to this event  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
until recently  the company believed that the cost saving benefits of its efforts to vertically integrate through the manufacture of carbon fiber had not benefited the company 
market prices for golf shaft raw materials  which are primarily based on carbon fiber costs  have been historically low with carbon fiber readily available at attractive prices when compared to the company s cost to purchase it from cft 
the company s gross margins and profitability were adversely affected when the market prices of carbon fiber were low 
however  in the second half of  the availability of carbon fiber began to tighten and prices began to increase 
the shortage of carbon fiber in the world markets today is real and appears to be long term 
the company believes that cft is now a valuable strategic asset 
results of operations compared to net sales chg chg composite products composite materials total net sales net sales decreased by million for from the decrease in sales was attributed to a decrease in composite product sales  which were partially offset by an increase in composite materials sales 
the decrease in the composite product sales is mainly attributed to a change in product mix in as compared to the company s average selling price of golf shaft sales decreased by for the year and overall units declined by 
there were decreases in sales of branded and co branded products  which were partially offset by increases in oem products 
branded golf shaft sales declined by and co branded golf shaft sales declined by  which were partially offset by an increase in oem stock type shaft sales of

this deferred tax asset represented net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and other basis differences  which give rise to future tax deductions in excess of book deductions 
realization of these tax benefits is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income 
during the fourth quarter of  management determined that based on its then current outlook and existing circumstances that it was not likely that the tax benefits associated with its deferred tax assets would be realized 
accordingly  the company placed a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset as of december  based upon the company s results in  the company re addressed the appropriateness of its valuation allowance and the circumstances that led to the establishment of its valuation allowance
