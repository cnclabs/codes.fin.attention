valuation of intangible assets is generally based on the estimated cash flows related to those assets  while the value assigned to goodwill is the residual of the purchase price over the fair value of all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
useful lives are determined based on the expected future period of benefit of the asset  the assessment of which considers various characteristics of the asset  including historical cash flows 
asset impairments long lived assets  including plant and equipment  and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that a diminution in value may have occurred  based on a comparison of undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying amount of the intangible asset
