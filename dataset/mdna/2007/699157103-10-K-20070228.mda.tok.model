item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our financial position and results of operations for each year in the three year period ended december  you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements 
for a description of limitations inherent in forward looking statements  see cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements on page ii 
overview and strategy our primary objective is to increase stockholder value by increasing reserves  production  cash flow and earnings 
we have shifted the balance of our investments from properties having high rates of production in early years to properties expected to produce more consistently over a longer term 
we attempt to reduce our financial risks by dedicating a smaller portion of our capital to high risk projects  while reserving the majority of our available capital for acquisitions  exploitation and development drilling opportunities 
obtaining positions in long lived oil and natural gas reserves are given priority over properties that might provide more cash flow in the early years of production  but which have shorter reserve lives 
we also attempt to further reduce risk by emphasizing acquisition possibilities over high risk exploration projects 
during the latter part of  we reduced our emphasis on high risk exploration efforts and started focusing on established geologic trends where we can utilize the engineering  operational  financial and technical expertise of our entire staff 
although we do participate in exploratory drilling activities  reducing financial  reservoir  drilling and geological risks and diversifying our property portfolio are important criteria in the execution of our business plan 
in summary  our current business plan focuses on projects having less geologic risk  emphasizes acquisition  exploitation  development and enhancement activities  includes the utilization of horizontal and fracture stimulation technologies on certain types of reservoirs  
table of contents focuses on acquiring producing properties  and expands the scope of operations by diversifying our exploratory and development efforts  both in and outside of our current areas of operation 
we continue our efforts to maintain low general and administrative expenses relative to the size of our overall operations  utilize advanced technologies  serve as operator in appropriate circumstances  and reduce operating costs 
the extent to which we are able to implement and follow through with our business plan will be influenced by the prices we receive for the oil and natural gas we produce  the results of reprocessing and reinterpreting our d seismic data  the results of our drilling activities  the costs of obtaining high quality field services  our ability to find and consummate acquisition opportunities  and our ability to negotiate and enter into work to earn arrangements  joint venture or other similar agreements on terms acceptable to us 
significant changes in the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas  or the occurrence of unanticipated events beyond our control may cause us to defer or deviate from our business plan  including the amounts we have budgeted for our activities 
operating performance our operating performance is influenced by several factors  the most significant of which are the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas and the quantities of oil and natural gas that we are able to produce 
the world price for oil has overall influence on the prices that we receive for our oil production 
the prices received for different grades of oil are based upon the world price for oil  which is then adjusted based upon the particular grade 
typically  light oil is sold at a premium  while heavy grades of crude are discounted 
natural gas prices we receive are influenced by seasonal demand  weather  hurricane conditions in the gulf of mexico  availability of pipeline transportation to end users  proximity of our wells to major transportation pipeline infrastructures  and world oil prices 
additional factors influencing our overall operating performance include production expenses  overhead requirements  and costs of capital 

table of contents our oil and natural gas exploration  development and acquisition activities require substantial and continuing capital expenditures 
historically  the sources of financing to fund our capital expenditures have included cash flow from operations  sales of our equity securities  bank borrowings  and industry joint ventures 
depletion per boe in was  as compared to in and in the increase per boe in was a result of increased drilling costs and recent acquisitions of producing properties 
results of operations as described under item business about our strategy and business  we changed our business model in at the beginning of  our total proved reserves were approximately mmboe with a reserves to production ratio of approximately to through the execution of this business model  our reserves at the end of were approximately mmboe with a reserves to production ratio of approximately to as described on page of this annual report on form k  the failure to replace oil and natural gas reserves may negatively affect our business 
we monitor this risk by comparing the quantity of our oil and natural gas reserves at the end of each year to our production for that year 
this comparison  which is made in the form of a reserves to production ratio  helps us measure our ability to offset produced volumes with new reserves that will be produced in the future 
the reserves to production ratio is calculated by dividing the total proved reserves at the end of a year by the actual production for the same year 
the annual change in this ratio provides us with an indication of our performance in replenishing annual production volumes 
the reserves to production ratio is a statistical indicator that has limitations 
the ratio is limited because it can vary widely based on the extent and timing of new discoveries and property acquisitions 
in addition  the ratio does not take into account the cost or timing of future production of new reserves 
for that reason  the ratio does not  and is not intended to  provide a measurement of value 
at the end of  our production was natural gas and oil  as compared to approximately natural gas and oil at the end of the production stream changed from shorter lived gulf coast natural gas to longer lived permian basin oil production and has increased our lease operating expense primarily due to increased utilities and chemicals associated with the operation of oil properties

critical accounting policies and practices full cost and impairment of assets 
we account for our oil and natural gas exploration and development activities using the full cost method of accounting 
under this method  all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties are capitalized 
costs of non producing properties  wells in process of being drilled and significant development projects are excluded from depletion until such time as the related project is developed and proved reserves are established or impairment is determined 
at the end of each quarter  the net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties  as adjusted for asset retirement obligations  is limited to the lower of unamortized cost or a ceiling  based on the present value of estimated future net revenues  net of income tax effects  discounted at  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of our unproved properties 
estimated future net revenues are measured at unescalated oil and natural gas prices at the end of each quarter  with effect given to our cash flow hedge positions 
if the net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties exceed the ceiling  we are subject to a ceiling test write down to the extent of the excess 
a ceiling test write down is a non cash charge to earnings 
it reduces earnings and impacts stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and may result in lower depreciation  depletion and amortization expense in future periods 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties increases when oil and natural gas prices decline 
if commodity prices deteriorate  it is possible that we could incur an impairment in future periods 

table of contents depletion 
provision for depletion of oil and natural gas properties under the full cost method is calculated using the unit of production method based upon estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves with oil and natural gas production being converted to a common unit of measurement based upon relative energy content 
investments in unproved properties and major development projects are not amortized until proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined or until impairment occurs 
oil and natural gas properties included million and million for and  respectively  for unevaluated properties not included in depletion 
the cost of any impaired property is transferred to the balance of oil and natural gas properties subject to depletion 
proved reserve estimates 
the discounted present value of our proved oil and natural gas reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation  and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments 
estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data  projected future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves requires substantial judgment  resulting in imprecise determinations  particularly for new discoveries 
different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same data 
our reserve estimates are prepared by independent petroleum engineers 
the passage of time provides more qualitative information regarding estimates of reserves  and revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect updated information 
however  there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future 
if future revisions significantly reduce previously estimated reserve quantities  it could result in a full cost ceiling write down 
at december   our ceiling was in excess of our capitalized costs 
in addition to the impact of the estimates of proved reserves in calculating the ceiling test  estimates of proved reserves are also a significant component of the calculations of depreciation  depletion and amortization 
while estimates of the quantities of proved reserves require substantial subjective judgment  the associated prices of oil and natural gas reserves that are included in the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require that prices and costs in effect as of the last day of the period are held constant indefinitely 
accordingly  the resulting value is not indicative of the true fair value of the reserves 
oil and natural gas prices have historically been cyclical and  on the last day of a quarter  can be either substantially higher or lower than prices we actually receive in the long term  which are a barometer for true fair value 
use of estimates 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported assets  liabilities  expenses  and some narrative disclosures 
hydrocarbon reserves  future development costs and certain hydrocarbon production expenses are the most critical estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
derivatives 
the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 that requires all derivative instruments to be recorded on the balance sheet at their respective fair values 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  during the period from january  to june   new derivative contracts were designated as cash flow hedges 
these contracts remained designated as cash flow hedges through their settlement 
accordingly  the effective portion of the unrealized gains or losses was recorded in other comprehensive loss until the settlement of the contract position occurred 
at settlement of these contracts  the cash value paid was recorded in revenue along with oil and natural gas sales  or in interest expense along with the interest expense that we incurred under our credit facilities 
as of december   we had no remaining contracts which were designated as hedges 
for periods prior to and for periods after july   derivative contracts entered into were not designated as cash flow hedges 
accordingly  the unrealized gain or loss on these derivative contracts was recorded in other income 
at settlement of these contracts  the realized gain or loss remains in other income and is not offset against oil and natural gas sales or interest expense 
although we have designated our derivative contracts differently in different periods  the purpose of all of our derivative contracts is to provide a measure of stability in our oil and natural gas receipts and interest rate payments and to manage exposure to commodity price and interest rate risk under existing sales contracts

the increase in natural gas volumes increased revenue approximately million for average realized wellhead natural gas prices decreased  or per mcf  to per mcf 
the decrease in natural gas prices had a negative effect on revenues of approximately million for the year ended december  
table of contents the negative effect on oil revenues of oil hedges decreased approximately  or  for  as compared to  because contracts settled in had relatively higher strike prices in relation to the related market price at settlement

our increase in lease operating expenses is due to mechanical  ad valorem and utility costs which increased our related lifting costs to per boe in  as compared to per boe in we experienced a increase in our per boe lifting costs primarily due to higher lifting costs associated with non operated wells and newly acquired operated wells for the year ended december  the lifting costs per boe are expected to be reduced by further development of our natural gas properties 
production taxes increased  or  million in  which was associated with an increase in revenues of million 
production taxes in future periods will continue to be a function of product mix  production volumes and product prices 
total general and administrative expenses increased  or million  in over during the second quarter of  we determined that stock options to purchase  shares of common stock had been granted in to four of our employees under our stock option plan  but which were not available for issuance under the plan 
in june  the board of directors authorized us to enter into settlement and release agreements with the four employees 
under these agreements  we made a one time lump sum cash payment to each employee in an amount equal to the spread between the exercise price of the options and the closing price of our stock on june  the total cash payments were approximately  this amount was charged to general and administrative expense during the second quarter of general and administrative expenses capitalized to the full cost pool were million for  compared to million for on a boe basis  general and administrative costs were per boe in compared to per boe in  while public reporting costs were per boe and per boe for the same period 
included in our total general and administrative expenses are public reporting costs which increased  or million 
increased public reporting costs included  but were not limited to  increases in road show expenses  corporate counseling and oil and natural gas reserve analysis 
in addition  we incurred additional public reporting costs associated with the stock options granted to our board of directors in late depreciation and depletion expense increased or million for compared to depletion per boe was for and for this increase is attributable to increased drilling costs  recent producing property purchases and reserve revisions as a result of decreased natural gas prices 
we anticipate fiscal year depletion costs will increase with increased production volumes

prior to  we designated our derivative contracts as cash flow hedges 
beginning in july  we ceased designating our derivative contracts as cash flow hedges 
as a result  changes in the fair value of these contracts were recorded in this account 
the loss also increased because of large increases in commodity prices for oil contracts 
future gains or losses on derivatives not classified as hedges are impacted by the volatility of commodity prices and interest rates  as well as by the terms of any new derivative contracts 
the loss associated with the ineffective portion of our hedges decreased  or  for  compared to commodity prices increased in  resulting in the ineffective portion being recorded in other expense 
the ineffective hedge gain or loss fluctuates until settlement of our contracts

capital resources and liquidity our capital resources consist primarily of cash flows from our oil and natural gas properties  bank borrowings supported by our oil and natural gas reserves and equity offerings 
our level of earnings and cash flows depends on many factors  including the prices we receive for oil and natural gas we produce 
working capital decreased approximately million as of december  compared with december  current liabilities exceeded current assets by at december  the working capital decrease was due to increased obligations associated with our accelerated drilling program in the following table summarizes our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities year ended december  in thousands operating activities investing activities financing activities 
table of contents cash provided from operating activities in increased million over largely due to increased net income from an increase in our production and a million earnings distribution from equity method investments that resulted from our sale of the pipeline assets 
cash used in investing activities increased in compared to  primarily as a result of our accelerated drilling activities in cash provided by financing activities increased due to additional bank borrowings to fund our acquisitions and increased drilling activities 
proceeds from our equity offering were utilized for general corporate purposes  including debt repayment and the acceleration of our drilling and completion operations in certain core areas 
historically  we have funded our operations  capital requirements and interest expense requirements with cash flows from our oil and natural gas properties  bank borrowings and proceeds from sales of our equity securities 
although we expect these same capital resources to support our future activities  we continually review and consider alternative methods of financing 
credit facilities we have two separate credit facilities 
our third amended and restated credit agreement or  the revolving credit agreement with a group of bank lenders provides us with a revolving line of credit having a borrowing base limitation of million at december  the total amount that we can borrow and have outstanding at any one time is limited to the lesser of million or the borrowing base established by the lenders 
at december   the principal amount outstanding under our revolving credit facility was million  excluding  reserved for our letters of credit 
our second credit facility is a five year term loan facility provided to us under a second lien term loan agreement or  the second lien agreement  with a group of banks and other lenders 
at december   our term loan under this facility was fully funded in the principal amount of million  which was outstanding on that same date 
revolving credit facility the revolving credit agreement allows us to borrow  repay and reborrow amounts available under the revolving credit facility 
the amount of the borrowing base is based primarily upon the estimated value of our oil and natural gas reserves 
the borrowing base amount is redetermined by the lenders semi annually on or about april and october of each year or at other times required by the lenders or at our request 
if  as a result of the lenders redetermination of the borrowing base  the outstanding principal amount of our loans exceeds the borrowing base  we must either provide additional collateral to the lenders or repay the outstanding principal of our loans in an amount equal to the excess 
except for the principal payments that may be required because of our outstanding loans being in excess of the borrowing base  interest only is payable monthly 
loans made to us under this revolving credit facility bear interest at the base rate of citibank  na or the libor rate  at our election 
generally  citibank s base rate is equal to its prime rate as announced from time to time by citibank 
the libor rate is generally equal to the sum of a the rate designated as british bankers association interest settlement rates and offered in one  two  three  six or twelve month interest periods for deposits of million  and b a margin ranging from to  depending upon the outstanding principal amount of our loans 
if the principal amount outstanding is equal to or greater than of the borrowing base  the margin is 
if the principal amount outstanding is equal to or greater than  but less than of the borrowing base  the margin is 
if the principal amount outstanding is less than of the borrowing base  the margin is the interest rate we are required to pay on our borrowings  including the applicable margin  may never be less than 
at december   our weighted average base rate and libor rate  plus the applicable margin  was on million  the outstanding principal amount of our revolving loan on that same date 
in the case of base rate loans  interest is payable on the last day of each month 
in the case of libor loans  interest is payable on the last day of each applicable interest period 

table of contents if the total outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility are less than the borrowing base  we are required to pay an unused commitment fee to the lenders in an amount equal to 
of the daily average of the unadvanced portion of the borrowing base 
the fee is payable quarterly 
if the borrowing base is increased  we are also required to pay a fee of 
on the amount of any such increase 
all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest under the revolving credit facility is due and payable on october  the maturity date of our outstanding loans may be accelerated by the lenders upon the occurrence of an event of default under the revolving credit agreement 
the revolving credit agreement contains various restrictive covenants  including i maintenance of a minimum current ratio  ii maintenance of a maximum ratio of funded indebtedness to earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation  depletion and amortization  iii maintenance of a minimum net worth  iv prohibition of payment of dividends and v restrictions on incurrence of additional debt 
we have pledged substantially all of our producing oil and natural gas properties to secure the repayment of our indebtedness under the revolving credit agreement 
as of december  we were in compliance with all of the covenants in our revolving credit agreement 
second lien term loan facility we also have a million term loan made available to us under our second lien term loan agreement or  the second lien agreement 
similar to our revolving credit agreement  loans made to us under this credit facility bear interest  at our election  at an alternate base rate or a rate designated in the agreement as the libo rate 
the alternate base rate is the greater of a the prime rate in effect on any day and b the federal funds effective rate in effect on such day plus of  plus a margin of per annum 
the libo rate is generally equal to the sum of a a rate appearing in the dow jones market service for the applicable interest periods offered in one  two  three or six month periods and b an applicable margin rate per annum equal to 
our producing oil and natural gas properties are also pledged to secure payment of our indebtedness under this facility  but the liens granted to the lender under the second lien agreement are second and junior to the rights of the first lienholders under the revolving credit agreement 
at december   our libo interest rate  plus the applicable margin  was on million  the outstanding principal amount of our term loan on that same date 
in the case of alternate base rate loans  interest is payable the last day of each march  june  september and december 
in the case of libo loans  interest is payable on the last day of the interest period applicable to each tranche  but not to exceed intervals of three months 
the second lien agreement contains various restriction covenants  including i maintenance of a maximum ratio of debt to earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation  depletion and amortization  ii maintenance of a minimum ratio of oil and natural gas reserve value to debt  iii prohibition of payment of dividends  and iv restrictions on incurrence of additional debt 
all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest under the second lien agreement is due and payable on november  the maturity date may be accelerated by the lenders upon the occurrence of an event of default under the second lien agreement 
as of december  we were in compliance with all of the covenants in our second lien agreement 
interest accrued for the year ended december   for both of our credit facilities  was approximately million 
of this amount  approximately  was capitalized 

table of contents preferred stock at december  we had  shares of convertible preferred stock outstanding 
the preferred stock required us to pay dividends of 
per annum  semi annually on june and december of each year  was convertible into common stock at any time  at the option of the holder  into shares of common stock at an initial conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment in certain events  was redeemable at our option  in whole or in part  for per share  plus accrued dividends  had no voting rights  except as required by applicable law  was senior to the common stock with respect to dividends and on liquidation  dissolution or winding up of parallel  had a liquidation value of per share  plus accrued and unpaid dividends 
as of june   all  outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock had been converted into  shares of common stock 
commodity price risk management transactions and effects of derivative instruments the purpose of our derivative transactions is to provide a measure of stability in our cash flows 
the derivative trade arrangements we have employed include collars  costless collars  floors or purchased puts  and oil  natural gas and interest rate swaps 
in  we designated our derivative trades as cash flow hedges under the provisions of sfas  as amended 
although our purpose for entering into derivative trades has remained the same  contracts entered into after june  have not been designated as cash flow hedges 
at december   we had no derivatives in place that were designated as cash flow hedges 
all commodity derivative contracts at december  are accounted for by mark to market accounting whereby changes in fair value are charged to earnings 
changes in the fair values of derivatives are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations as these changes occur in the other income expense  net 
to the extent these trades relate to production in and beyond  and oil prices increase  we will report a loss currently  but if there is no further change in prices  our revenue will be correspondingly higher than if there had been no price increase when the production is sold 
all interest rate swaps that we have entered into for and beyond are accounted for by mark to market accounting as prescribed in sfas we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our derivative trade instruments 
however  we periodically assess the creditworthiness of the counterparties to mitigate this credit risk 
for additional information about our price risk management transactions  see item a of this annual report on form k  beginning on page future capital requirements our capital expenditure budget for is approximately million and is highly dependent on future oil and natural gas prices and the availability of funding 
in addition to the impact that oil and natural gas prices will have on our budget  these expenditures will also be subject to our internally generated cash flows  the availability of additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility  the availability of supplies and services  
table of contents additional sources of funding  and our future drilling successes 
contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements we have contractual obligations and commitments that may affect our financial condition 
the following table is a summary of our significant contractual obligations obligation due in period contractual cash obligations after years total in thousands revolving credit facility secured term loan facility secured office lease dinero plaza andrews and snyder field offices asset retirement obligations derivative obligations drilling contract total the snyder office lease expires upon the cessation of production from the diamond m area wells 
the andrews field office lease expires in december the lease cost for these two office facilities are billed to nonaffiliated third party working interest owners under our joint operating agreements with these third parties 
asset retirement obligations of oil and natural gas assets  excluding salvage value and accretion 
deferred taxes are not included in the table above 
the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards combined with our plans for development and acquisitions may offset any major cash outflows 
however  the ultimate timing of the settlements cannot be precisely determined 
the amounts above include principal payment obligations under the revolving credit facility and second lien term loan facility noted in the table above  and interest payments on such indebtedness 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have no off balance sheet financing arrangements or any unconsolidated special purpose entities 
outlook the oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive 
we make  and anticipate that we will continue to make  substantial capital expenditures in the exploration for  development and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves 
historically  our capital expenditures have been financed primarily with internally generated cash from operations  proceeds from bank borrowings  and proceeds from sales of equity securities 
the continued availability of these capital sources depends upon a number of variables  including our proved reserves  
table of contents the volumes of oil and natural gas we produce from existing wells  the prices at which we sell oil and natural gas  and our ability to acquire  locate and produce new reserves 
each of these variables materially affects our borrowing capacity 
we may from time to time seek additional financing in the form of increased bank borrowings  sales of our debt and equity securities  sales of non core properties  and other forms of financing 
except for our existing revolving credit facility  we do not have any agreements for future financing and there can be no assurance as to the availability or terms of any such financing 
inflation our drilling costs have escalated and we would expect this trend to continue 
however  over the past several years our commodity prices have increased to offset the effects of cost inflation

since our interest rates are variable and reflect current market conditions  the carrying value of our bank debt approximates the fair value

market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in oil and natural gas prices 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing domestic price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to the region in which we produce natural gas 
historically  prices received for oil and natural gas production have been volatile and unpredictable 
we expect pricing volatility to continue 
oil prices we received during ranged from a low of per barrel to a high of

natural gas prices we received during ranged from a low of per mcf to a high of per mcf 
a significant decline in the prices of oil or natural gas could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

as of december   we had employed costless collars  collars and swaps in order to protect against this price volatility 
although all of the contracts that we have entered into are viewed as protection against this price volatility  all contracts are accounted for by the mark to market accounting method as prescribed in sfas as of december   we had one commodity swap contract with bnp paribas that was designated as a cash flow hedge 
this contract covered a total of  barrels of crude oil production in at a nymex swap price of per bbl

generally  swaps are an agreement to buy or sell a specified commodity for delivery in the future  but at an agreed fixed price 
swap transactions convert a floating or market price into a fixed price 
for any particular swap transaction  the counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the reference price for any settlement period is less than the swap or fixed price for the applicable derivative contract  and we are required to make a payment to the counterparty if the reference price for any settlement period is greater than the swap or fixed price for the applicable derivative contract
