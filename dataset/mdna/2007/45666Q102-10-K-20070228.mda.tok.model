the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a leading provider of enterprise data integration software 
we generate revenues from sales of software licenses for our enterprise data integration software products and from sales of services  which consist of maintenance  consulting  and education services 
we receive revenues from licensing our products under perpetual licenses directly to end users and indirectly through resellers  distributors  and oems in the united states and internationally 
we also receive a small amount of revenues under subscription based licenses from companies making our technology available as part of their own on demand offerings 
most of our international sales have been in europe  and revenue outside of europe and north america has comprised or less of total consolidated revenues during the last three years 
we receive service revenues from maintenance contracts  consulting services  and education services that we perform for customers that license our products either directly or indirectly 
we license our software and provide services to many industry sectors  including energy and utilities  financial services  insurance  government and public sector  healthcare  high technology  manufacturing  retail  services  telecommunications  and transportation 
in  our total revenues grew to million and we generated net income of million  or per diluted share 
the increase in license revenues was a result primarily of an increase in the average size of our transactions and  to a lesser extent  an increase in volume of transactions and an increase in international license revenues 
the increase in service revenues was primarily from increased maintenance revenues driven by strong renewals from our expanding customer base  coupled with contribution from the new releases of existing products 
on january   we acquired similarity systems limited similarity  a provider of a software product suite that includes data profiling  data standardization  data cleansing  data matching  and data quality monitoring 
we have extended our enterprise data integration platform by working to incorporate certain components of similarity s product suite  including its patented data quality technology 
on march   we issued and sold convertible senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of million due in notes 
we used approximately million of the net proceeds from the offering to fund the purchase of shares of our common stock concurrently with the offering of the notes  and we intend to use the balance of the net proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes  which may include the acquisition of businesses  products  product rights or technologies  strategic investments  or additional purchases of common stock 

table of contents on december   we acquired itemfield  inc itemfield  a private company  pursuant to a merger agreement 
under the merger agreement  itemfield stockholders  non employee option holders and certain employees are entitled to receive million in cash 
in addition  the options held by itemfield employees were assumed by informatica and converted into options to purchase approximately  shares of informatica common stock valued on the date of close at approximately million 
itemfield s data transformation technologies enable near universal access to unstructured and semi structured data 
incorporation of such technology extends our data integration platform to allow customers to integrate these data sources with traditional structured data sources 
with the acquisition of itemfield  informatica gained employees  based primarily in israel and the united states 
because our market is a dynamic one  we face both significant opportunities and challenges 
as such  we focus on several key factors competition inherent in our industry are risks arising from competition with existing software solutions  technological advances from other vendors  and the perception of cost savings by solving data integration challenges through customer hand coded development 
our prospective customers may view these alternative solutions as more attractive than our offerings 
additionally  the consolidation activity in our industry including business objects acquisition of firstlogic  and oracle s acquisition of sunopsis could pose challenges as competitors could potentially offer our prospective customers a broader suite of software products or solutions 
new product introductions to address the expanding data integration and data integrity needs of our customers and prospective customers  we continue to introduce new products and technology enhancements on a regular basis 
for example  in may  we delivered the generally available release of powercenter  which included new products  informatica data quality and informatica data explorer that deliver advanced data quality capabilities 
in september  we delivered general availability of the powercenter connect for salesforce 
com to enable joint customers to integrate data managed by salesforce 
com 
also  in november  we announced general availability of new versions of informatica data quality and informatica data explorer 
new product introductions and or enhancements have inherent risks including  but not limited to  product availability  product quality and interoperability  and customer adoption or the delay in customer purchases 
given the risks and new nature of the products  we cannot predict their impact on overall sales and revenues 
quarterly and seasonal fluctuations historically  purchasing patterns in the software industry have followed quarterly and seasonal trends and they are likely to do so in the future 
we typically recognize a substantial portion of our new license orders in the last month of each quarter and sometimes in the last few weeks of each quarter although such fluctuations are mitigated by backlog orders entering into a quarter 
seasonally  in recent years  the fourth quarter has generated the highest level of license revenue and order backlog  and we have generally had lower levels of demand for our software products and services in the first and third quarters 
additionally  our consulting and education services have sometimes been negatively impacted in the fourth quarter and first quarter due to the holiday season and internal meetings  which result in fewer billable hours for our consultants and fewer education classes 
to address these potential risks  we have focused on a number of key initiatives  including the strengthening of our partnerships  the broadening of our distribution capability worldwide and the targeting of our sales force and distribution channel on new products 
we are concentrating on expanding and extending our relationships with our existing strategic partners and building relationships with additional strategic partners 
these partners include systems integrators  resellers and distributors  as well as strategic technology partners  including enterprise application providers  database vendors  and enterprise information integration vendors  in the united states and internationally 
in addition to becoming a global oem partner with hyperion solutions and partnering with salesforce 
com  we expanded and extended our oem relationship with oracle 
see risk factors we rely on our relationships with our strategic partners 
if we do not maintain and strengthen these relationships  our ability to generate revenue and control expenses could be adversely affected  which could cause a decline in the price of our common stock in item a 
additionally  our alliance managers have developed and continue to add new strategic partnerships with vendors in the on demand market 
in  we formalized our relationship with deloitte consulting and jointly went to market with its enterprise risk services practice and our data quality products 
we also expanded our market reach with new reseller agreements with teradata and sun microsystems 
we have also broadened our distribution efforts 
in  we continued to expand our sales both in terms of selling data warehouse products to the enterprise level and of selling more strategic data integration solutions beyond data warehousing  including data quality  data migrations  data consolidations  data synchronizations  data hubs and cross enterprise data 
table of contents integration to our customers enterprise architects and chief information officers 
we have also continued expanding our international sales presence by opening new offices and increasing headcount 
this included opening sales offices in brazil  china  india  japan  south korea and taiwan 
we also established training partnerships in india  latin america and the united states to provide hands on product training for customers and partners 
as the result of this international expansion  as well as the increase in our direct sales headcount in the united states during  our sales and marketing expenses have increased accordingly during and we expect these investments to result in increased revenues and productivity and ultimately higher profitability 
however  if we experience an increase in sales personnel turnover  do not achieve expected increases in our sales pipeline  experience a decline in our sales pipeline conversion ratio  or do not achieve increases in productivity and efficiencies from our new sales personnel as they gain more experience  then we may not achieve our expected increases in revenue  productivity  or profitability 
while we have experienced some increases in revenue and productivity in the united states  we have not yet achieved such increases in productivity internationally 
to address the risks of introducing new products  we have continued to invest in programs to help train our internal sales force and our external distribution channel on new product functionalities  key differentiations  and key business values 
these programs include informatica world for customers and partners  our annual sales kickoff conference for all sales and key marketing personnel  webinars for our direct sales force and indirect distribution channel  in person technical seminars for our pre sales consultants  the building of product demonstrations  and creation and distribution of targeted marketing collateral 
we have also invested in partner enablement programs  including product specific briefings to partners and the inclusion of several partners in our beta programs 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make assumptions  judgments  and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
we base our assumptions  judgments  and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions  judgments  and estimates and make changes accordingly 
we also discuss our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
we believe that the assumptions  judgments  and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition  facilities restructuring charges  accounting for income taxes  accounting for impairment of goodwill  acquisitions  and share based payment compensation expense have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
we discuss below the critical accounting estimates associated with these policies 
historically  our assumptions  judgments  and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
for further information on our significant accounting policies  see the discussion in note summary of significant accounting policies in notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
revenue recognition we follow detailed revenue recognition guidelines  which are discussed below 
we recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states that have been prescribed for the software industry 
the accounting rules related to revenue recognition are complex and are affected by interpretations of the rules  which are subject to change 
consequently  the revenue recognition accounting rules require management to make significant judgments  such as determining if collectibility is probable 
we derive revenues from software license fees  maintenance fees which entitle the customer to receive product support and unspecified software updates  and professional services  consisting of consulting and education services 
we follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenue 
the basis for recognizing software license revenue is determined by the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop software revenue recognition  together with other authoritative literature 
for other authoritative literature  see the subsection revenue recognition in note summary of significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
substantially all of our software licenses are perpetual licenses under which the customer acquires the perpetual right to use the software as provided and subject to the conditions of the license agreement 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
in applying these criteria to revenue transactions  we must exercise judgment and use estimates to determine the amount of software  maintenance  and professional services revenue to be recognized each period 

table of contents our judgment in determining the collectibility of amounts due from our customers impacts the timing of revenue recognition 
we assess credit worthiness and collectibility  and  when a customer is not deemed credit worthy  revenue is recognized when payment is received 
we assess whether fees are fixed or determinable prior to recognizing revenue 
we must make interpretations of our customer contracts and exercise judgments in determining if the fees associated with a license arrangement are fixed or determinable 
we consider factors including extended payment terms  financing arrangements  the category of customer end user customer or reseller  rights of return or refund  and our history of enforcing the terms and conditions of customer contracts 
if the fee due from a customer is not fixed or determinable due to extended payment terms  revenue is recognized when payment becomes due or upon cash receipt  whichever is earlier 
if we determine that a fee due from a reseller is not fixed or determinable upon shipment to the reseller  we defer the revenue until the reseller provides us with evidence of sell through to an end user customer or upon cash receipt 
our software license arrangements include multiple elements software license fees  maintenance fees  consulting  and or education services 
we use the residual method to recognize license revenue upon delivery when the arrangement includes elements to be delivered at a future date and vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists to allocate the fee to the undelivered elements of the arrangement 
vsoe is based on the price charged when an element is sold separately 
if vsoe does not exist for any undelivered element of the arrangement  all revenue is deferred until all elements have been delivered  or vsoe is established 
we are required to exercise judgment in determining if vsoe exists for each undelivered element 
consulting services  if included as part of the software arrangement  generally do not require significant modification or customization of the software 
if  in our judgment  the software arrangement includes significant modification or customization of the software  software license revenue is recognized as the consulting services revenue is recognized 
consulting revenues are primarily related to implementation services and product configurations performed on a time and materials basis and  occasionally  on a fixed fee basis 
revenue is generally recognized as these services are performed 
if uncertainty exists about our ability to complete the project  our ability to collect the amounts due  or in the case of fixed fee consulting arrangements  our ability to estimate the remaining costs to be incurred to complete the project  revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is resolved 
facilities restructuring charges during the fourth quarter of  we recorded significant charges the restructuring plan related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters to take advantage of more favorable lease terms and reduced operating expenses 
in addition  we significantly increased the restructuring charges the restructuring plan in the third and fourth quarters of due to changes in our assumptions used to calculate the original charges as a result of our decision to relocate our corporate headquarters 
the accrued restructuring charges represent gross lease obligations and estimated commissions and other costs principally leasehold improvements and asset write offs  offset by actual and estimated gross sublease income  which is net of estimated broker commissions and tenant improvement allowances  expected to be received over the remaining lease terms 
these liabilities include management s estimates pertaining to sublease activities 
inherent in the assessment of the costs related to our restructuring efforts are estimates related to the most likely expected outcome of the significant actions to accomplish the restructuring 
we will continue to evaluate the commercial real estate market conditions periodically to determine if our estimates of the amount and timing of future sublease income are reasonable based on current and expected commercial real estate market conditions 
our estimates of sublease income may vary significantly depending  in part  on factors that may be beyond our control  such as the time periods required to locate and contract suitable subleases and the market rates at the time of such subleases 
currently  we have subleased our excess facilities in connection with our and facilities restructuring but for durations that are generally less than the remaining lease terms 
if we determine that there is a change in the estimated sublease rates or in the expected time it will take us to sublease our vacant space  we may incur additional restructuring charges in the future and our cash position could be adversely affected 
for example  we increased our restructuring plan charges in and based on the continued deterioration in the san francisco bay area and dallas  texas real estate markets 
see note facilities restructuring charges in notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
future adjustments to the charges could result from a change in the time period that the buildings will be vacant  expected sublease rates  expected sublease terms  and the expected time it will take to sublease 
we have periodically updated the original restructuring charges based on current real estate market information and trend analysis and executed sublease agreements 

table of contents accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expenses or benefits are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
we also account for any income tax contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of currently enacted tax laws 
the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not contemplated 
as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes and tax contingencies in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in net deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be realizable and to the extent we believe that realizability is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or adjust such allowance in a period  we must include a tax expense or benefit within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to adjust our valuation allowance  which could impact our results of operations in the quarter in which such determination is made 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fas  accounting for income taxes fin  to create a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt fin as of january   as required 
the cumulative effect of adopting fin will be recorded in retained earnings and other accounts as applicable 
we have not determined the effect  if any  that the adoption of fin will have on our financial position and results of operations 
as a result of fin  we could have greater volatility in our effective tax rate in the future 
accounting for impairment of goodwill we assess goodwill for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level reporting unit at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events  as defined by sfas no 
consistent with our determination that we have only one reporting segment  we have determined that there is only one reporting unit  specifically the license  implementation  and support of our software products 
goodwill was tested for impairment in our annual impairment tests on october in each of the years   and using the two step process required by sfas no 
first  we reviewed the carrying amount of the reporting unit compared to the fair value of the reporting unit based on quoted market prices of our common stock 
if such comparison reflected potential impairment  we would then prepare the discounted cash flow analyses 
such analyses are based on cash flow assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates being used to manage the business 
an excess carrying value compared to fair value would indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
finally  if we determined that goodwill may be impaired  then we would compare the implied fair value of the goodwill  as defined by sfas no 
 to its carrying amount to determine the impairment loss  if any 
based on these estimates  we determined in our annual impairment tests as of october of each year that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount and  accordingly  goodwill was not impaired 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including such external factors as industry and economic trends and such internal factors as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 
accordingly  future changes in market capitalization or estimates used in discounted cash flows analyses could result in significantly different fair values of the reporting unit  which may impair goodwill 

table of contents acquisitions we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  liabilities assumed  as well as purchased in process research and development ipr d based on their estimated fair values 
we engage independent third party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
this valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to long lived and intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer contracts  customer lists  distribution agreements  trade names  non compete agreements  and acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the ipr d into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
share based payments we account for share based compensation related to share based transactions in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment expense is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based awards requires judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  forfeiture rates  and expected life 
we have estimated the expected volatility as an input into the black scholes valuation formula when assessing the fair value of options granted 
our current estimate of volatility was based upon a blend of average historical and market based implied volatilities of our stock price 
to the extent volatility of our stock price increases in the future  our estimates of the fair value of options granted in the future could increase  thereby increasing share based payment expense in future periods 
for instance  an estimate in volatility percentage points higher would have resulted in a million increase in the fair value of options granted during the year ended december  in addition  we apply an expected forfeiture rate when amortizing share based payment expense 
our estimate of the forfeiture rate is based primarily upon historical experience of employee turnover 
to the extent we revise this estimate in the future  our share based payment expense could be materially impacted in the quarter of revision  as well as in following quarters 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined that the estimated forfeiture rate for unvested options required an adjustment due to changes in retention rates  changes in the stock price  and other factors that generally increase an employee s expected length of service 
we lowered our forfeiture rate from during the nine months period ended december  to in the three months ended december   primarily due to changes in historical employee termination rates 
as a result of this change  our stock based compensation increased approximately million for the three months ended december  our expected term of options granted was derived from the historical option exercises  post vesting cancellations  and estimates concerning future exercises cancellations of vested unvested options that remain outstanding 
in the future  as empirical evidence regarding these input estimates is able to provide more directionally predictive results  we may change or refine our approach of deriving these input estimates 
these changes could impact our fair value of options granted in the future

table of contents our license revenues increased to million in compared to million in and million in  representing growth of million  or  in from  and million  or  in from the increase in license revenues in from was primarily due to an increase in the average size of our transactions and to a lesser extent was due to an increase in volume of transactions and an increase in international license revenues 
the increase in license revenues in from was primarily due to an increase in both the volume and the average size of our transactions  and an increase in international license revenues 
previously  we did not include upgrades  which were not part of the post contract services  in the determination of the average transaction amount 
we provide the upgrades that are part of the post contract services to our customers at no additional charge 
given the increased value and breadth of upgrades especially related to powercenter  we are now including upgrades in the calculation of the average transaction amount 
the average transaction amount for orders greater than  in  including upgrades  increased to  from  and  in and  respectively 
the number of transactions greater than million increased to in from in and in we believe that the increase in average transaction amount is primarily the result of larger deployments by customers and continued growth in the broader data integration market 
service revenues maintenance revenues maintenance revenues increased to million in from million in and million in  representing growth of million  or in from and million  or in from these increases in maintenance revenues in and were primarily due to consistently strong renewals of maintenance contracts in and  coupled with the continually increasing size of our customer base

the million  or increase in over was primarily due to million write off of licensed technology and higher transaction volumes for sales of royalty bearing products 
the million  or  increase in from was primarily due to higher transaction volumes for sales of royalty bearing products 
for  we expect the cost of license revenues as a percentage of license revenues to return to pre levels at approximately of license revenues 
cost of service revenues our cost of service revenues is a combination of costs of maintenance  consulting  and education services revenues 
our cost of maintenance revenues consists mainly of costs associated with customer service personnel expenses and royalty fees for maintenance related to third party software providers 
cost of consulting revenues consists primarily of personnel costs and expenses incurred in providing consulting services at customers facilities 
cost of education services revenues consists primarily of the costs of developing course curriculum and providing training classes and materials at our headquarters  sales and training offices  and customer locations

as a percentage of service revenues  we expect the cost of service revenues to remain relatively consistent with levels 
amortization of acquired technology amortization of acquired technology is the amortization of technologies acquired through business combinations 
amortization of acquired technology totaled million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the million or increase in from was primarily due to certain developed technology acquired in our acquisition of similarity 
the million or decrease in from was primarily due to certain developed technology acquired in our acquisition of striva being fully amortized as of december  for  we expect amortization of acquired technology to be approximately million including the amortization resulting from the similarity and itemfield acquisitions 
we may incur additional amortization expense beyond these expected future levels to the extent we make additional acquisitions 

table of contents operating expenses research and development years ended december  percentage change to to in thousands  except percentages research and development our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  consulting services  facilities  and related overhead costs associated with the development of new products  enhancement and localization of existing products  quality assurance  and development of documentation for our products 
the million or increase in from was primarily due to million increase in personnel related cost including travel related and equipment related expense  as a result of headcount increasing from in to in most of the headcount increase was related to the acquisitions of similarity and itemfield 
also contributing to this increase was an increase of million in legal expenses related to the business objects lawsuit  a million increase in stock based compensation  and a million increase in consulting services 
the million or decrease in from was primarily due to a million decrease in facilities and related overhead costs in connection with the restructuring plan and a million decrease in stock based compensation and was partially offset by a million increase in personnel related costs including travel related and equipment related expenses  as a result of headcount increasing from in to in research and development expenses represented   and of total revenues in   and  respectively 
to date  all software and development costs have been expensed since they were incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility

these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in deferred stock based compensation 
sales and marketing expenses represented   and of total revenues in   and  respectively 
for  we expect the sales and marketing expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  to slightly decrease from the levels 
we also expect the percentage of total revenues represented by sales and marketing expenses to fluctuate from period to period due to the timing of hiring of new sales and marketing personnel  our spending on marketing programs  and the level of the commission expenditures  in each period 
general and administrative years ended december  percentage change to to in thousands  except percentages general and administrative our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for finance  human resources  legal  and general management  as well as professional service expenses associated with recruiting  legal  and accounting services

the ipr d charges were associated with software development efforts in process at the time of the acquisition that had not yet achieved technological feasibility  and no future alternative uses had been identified 
the purchase price allocated to in process research and development was determined  in part  by a third party appraiser through established valuation techniques 
we did not incur any ipr d charges in relation to the itemfield acquisition 
we may further incur ipr d expense in the future to the extent we make additional acquisitions

table of contents facilities  there are changes to the time period that facilities are vacant  or the actual sublease income is different from current estimates 
our results of operations has been positively affected since by a significant decrease in rent expense and decreases to non cash depreciation and amortization expense for the leasehold improvements and equipment written off 
these combined savings were approximately to million annually compared to  after accretion charges  and we anticipate that they will continue in  and in addition  we will continue to evaluate our current facilities requirements to identify facilities that are in excess of our current and estimated future needs  as well as evaluate the assumptions related to estimated future sublease income for excess facilities 
accordingly  any changes to these estimates of excess facilities costs could result in additional charges that could materially affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations

liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations primarily through cash flows from operations and public offerings of our common stock 
as of december   we had million in available cash and cash equivalents and short term investments and million of restricted cash under the terms of our pacific shores property leases 
in january  pursuant to the purchase agreement  similarity stockholders were entitled to receive approximately million in cash and approximately  shares of informatica common stock which were fully vested but subject to escrow valued on the date of close at approximately million 
in addition  the options of similarity option holders were assumed by informatica and converted into options to purchase approximately  shares of informatica common stock valued on the date of close at approximately million 
in december  pursuant to a merger agreement  itemfield stockholders  non employee option holders and certain employees were entitled to receive approximately million in cash and the outstanding options held by itemfield employees were converted into approximately  shares of informatica stock options with a fair value of million  of which the company paid million prior to december  our primary sources of cash are the collection of accounts receivable from our customers and proceeds from the exercise of stock options and stock purchased under our employee stock purchase plan 
our uses of cash include payroll and payroll related expenses and operating expenses such as marketing programs  travel  professional services  and facilities and related costs 
we have also used cash to purchase property and equipment  repurchase common stock from the open market to reduce the dilutive impact of stock option issuances  and acquire businesses and technologies to expand our product offerings 
operating activities cash provided by operating activities in was million  representing an increase of million from this increase primarily resulted from an increase in net income  after adjusting for non cash expenses and increases in deferred revenue  accrued compensation and related expenses  and income taxes payable  offset by an increase in accounts receivable  prepaid expense and other assets primarily for insurance and third party software maintenance  payments to our vendors  and payments on our lease obligations under our facilities restructuring accrual 
our days sales outstanding in accounts receivable days outstanding increased from days at december  to days at december  due to higher sales toward the end of deferred revenues increased primarily due to increased customer support contracts and assumed deferred revenue in connection with the acquisition of itemfield in december cash provided by operating activities in was million  representing an increase of million from this increase primarily resulted from an increase in net income  after adjusting for non cash expenses and increases in deferred revenue  accrued compensation and related expenses  and income taxes payable  offset by an increase in accounts receivable and prepaid expense and other assets primarily for insurance and third party software maintenance  payments to our vendors  and payments on our lease obligations under our facilities restructuring accrual 
our days sales outstanding in accounts receivable decreased from days at december  to days at december  deferred revenues increased primarily due to increased customer support contracts and increase in deferred license revenues 
days outstanding at december  were primarily impacted by improvements to our collection program 
cash provided by operating activities in was million  representing an increase of million from this increase primarily resulted from adding back accrued facilities restructuring charges and non cash expenses to our net loss and an increase in deferred revenues  accrued compensation and related expenses  and income taxes payable 
the cash provided by operating activities in was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable  prepaid expenses  and other assets and payments against accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the increase in the facilities restructuring accrual resulted from the abandonment of our former corporate headquarters associated with our restructuring plan and the re evaluation of sublease prospects for our excess facilities 
deferred revenues increased due to increased customer support contracts 
our days outstanding increased to days at december  from days at december  investing activities we anticipate that we will continue to purchase necessary property and equipment in the normal course of our business 
the amount and timing of these purchases and the related cash outflows in future periods depend on a 
table of contents number of factors  including the hiring of employees  the rate of change of computer hardware and software used in our business  and our business outlook 
we have classified our investment portfolio as available for sale  and our investment objectives are to preserve principal and provide liquidity while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
we may sell an investment at any time if the quality rating of the investment declines  the yield on the investment is no longer attractive  or we are in need of cash 
because we invest only in investment securities that are highly liquid with a ready market  we believe that the purchase  maturity  or sale of our investments has no material impact on our overall liquidity 
we have used cash to acquire businesses and technologies that enhance and expand our product offerings  and we anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future 
the nature of these transactions makes it difficult to predict the amount and timing of such cash requirements 
financing activities we receive cash from the exercise of common stock options and the sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan espp 
net cash provided by financing activities in was million including issuance of convertible debt for million and issuance of common stock to option holders and participants of espp for million 
net cash provided by financing activities in and was million and million  respectively  and was due to issuance of common stock to option holders and participants of espp 
although we expect to continue to receive some proceeds from the issuance of common stock to option holders and participants of espp in future periods  the timing and amount of such proceeds are difficult to predict and are contingent on a number of factors  including the price of our common stock  the number of employees participating in our stock option plans and our employee stock purchase plan  and general market conditions 
on march   we issued and sold convertible senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of million due in notes 
we used approximately million of the net proceeds from the offering to fund the purchase of  shares of our common stock concurrently with the offering of the notes 
in  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program for up to million shares of our common stock 
in  the board approved an extension of this program to december  these purchases could be made from time to time in the open market  and they were funded from available working capital 
the purpose of our stock repurchase program is  among other things  to help offset the dilution caused by the issuance of stock under our employee stock option plans 
the number of shares acquired and the timing of the repurchases are based on several factors  including general market conditions and the trading price of our common stock 
in april  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to million of our common stock at any time until april as of december   we repurchased  of our common stocks for million 
under this program  we purchased  shares at a cost of million and  shares at a cost of million in and  respectively 
these shares were retired and reclassified as authorized and unissued shares of common stock 
the share repurchase program expired at december  see item of this report for more information regarding the stock repurchase plan 
we may continue to repurchase shares from time to time  as determined by management under programs approved by the board of directors 
the timing and terms of the transactions will depend on market conditions  our liquidity  and other considerations 
we believe that our cash balances and the cash flows generated by operations will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
given our cash balances  it is less likely but still possible that we may require or desire additional funds to support our operating expenses and capital requirements or for other purposes  such as acquisitions  and may raise such additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing or from other sources 
we may not be able to obtain adequate or favorable financing at that time  and any financing we obtain might be dilutive to our stockholders 

table of contents contractual obligations and operating leases the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands payment due by period and and and total beyond operating lease obligations operating lease payments future sublease income net operating lease obligations debt obligations principal payments interest payments other obligations other purchase obligations and commitments include minimum royalty payments under license agreements and do not include purchase obligations discussed below 
our contractual obligations for include the lease term for our headquarters office in redwood city  california  which is from december  to december  we have a three year option to renew this lease to december  at fair market value 
if we decide to exercise our renewal option  the renewal rate may not be comparable to our current rate 
the minimum contractual lease payment is million for contractual obligations purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of certain goods and services are not included in the preceding table 
we cannot determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations because purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum  or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones are not included in the table above 
we base our estimates of the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
operating leases we lease certain office facilities and equipment under non cancelable operating leases 
during   and  we recorded facilities restructuring charges related to the consolidation of excess leased facilities in the san francisco bay area and texas 
operating lease payments in the table above include approximately million  net of actual sublease income  for operating lease commitments for those facilities that are included in restructuring charges 
see note facilities restructuring charges and note commitments and contingencies of notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
of these future minimum lease payments  we have million recorded in the restructuring and excess facilities accrual at december  this accrual  in addition to minimum lease payments of million  includes estimated operating expenses of million  is net of estimated sublease income of million  and is net of the present value impact of million recorded in accordance with sfas no 
we estimated sublease income and the related timing thereof based 
table of contents on existing sublease agreements and current market conditions  among other factors 
our estimates of sublease income may vary significantly from actual amounts realized depending  in part  on factors that may be beyond our control  such as the time periods required to locate and contract suitable subleases and the market rates at the time of such subleases 
in relation to our excess facilities  we may decide to negotiate and enter into lease termination agreements  if and when the circumstances are appropriate 
these lease termination agreements would likely require that a significant amount of the remaining future lease payments be paid at the time of execution of the agreement  but would release us from future lease payment obligations for the abandoned facility 
the timing of a lease termination agreement and the corresponding payment could materially affect our cash flows in the period of payment 
the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different 
we have sublease agreements for leased office space in palo alto  san francisco  scotts valley  and at the pacific shores center in redwood city  california 
in the event the sublessees are unable to fulfill their obligations  we would be responsible for rent due under the leases 
however  we expect the sublessees will fulfill their obligations under these leases 
in february  we entered into two lease agreements for two buildings at the pacific shores center in redwood city  california our former corporate headquarters  which we occupied from august through december the lease expires in july as part of these agreements  we have purchased certificates of deposit totaling million as a security deposit for lease payments 
in connection with our january acquisition of similarity and december acquisition of itemfield  we have assumed leases located primarily in dublin  ireland  and tel aviv  israel 
other uses of cash in january and december  in connection with the similarity and itemfield acquisitions  we used approximately million and million cash  respectively  as part of the consideration 
a portion of our cash may be further used to acquire or invest in other complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use other complementary technologies 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we may evaluate potential acquisitions of such businesses  products  or technologies 
the nature of these transactions makes it difficult to predict the amount and timing of such cash requirements 
we may also be required to raise additional financing to complete future acquisitions 
letter of credit we have a million letter of credit issued by a financial institution that is required as collateral for our former corporate headquarter leases at the pacific shores center until the leases expire in these certificates of deposit are classified as long term restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet 
the letter of credit currently bears interest of 
there are no financial covenant requirements under our line of credit 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements  or transactions  arrangements or relationships with special purpose entities

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non trading purposes 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure to offset the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
as of december   we did not hold derivative financial instruments 

table of contents interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer  or type of investment 
our investments consist primarily of us government notes and bonds  auction rate securities  corporate bonds  commercial paper and municipal securities 
all investments are carried at market value  which approximates cost 
see note cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
the following table presents the fair value of cash equivalents and short term investments that are subject to interest rate risk and the average interest rate as of december  and dollars in thousands years ended december  cash and short term investments average rate of return our cash equivalents and short term investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
as of december   we had net unrealized losses of million associated with these securities 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by basis points from levels as of december   the fair market value of the portfolio would decline by approximately million 
additionally  we have the ability to hold our investments until maturity and  therefore  we would not necessarily expect to realize an adverse impact on income or cash flows 
foreign currency risk we market and sell our software and services through our direct sales force and indirect channel partners in north america  europe  asia pacific  and latin america 
accordingly  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
to date  the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on revenue and operating expenses has not been material 
operating expenses incurred by our foreign subsidiaries are denominated primarily in local currencies 
we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge these operating expenses 
we will continue to assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis 
the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is their local currency  except for informatica cayman ltd  which is in euros 
our exposure to foreign exchange risk is related to the magnitude of foreign net profits and losses denominated in foreign currencies  in particular the euro and british pound  as well as our net position of monetary assets and monetary liabilities in those foreign currencies 
these exposures have the potential to produce either gains or losses within our consolidated results 
our foreign operations  however  in most instances act as a natural hedge since both operating expenses as well as revenues are generally denominated in their respective local currency 
in these instances  although an unfavorable change in the exchange rate of foreign currencies against the us dollar will result in lower revenues when translated into us dollars  the operating expenditures will be lower as well 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes
