in may  we completed our acquisition of tacit for an initial purchase price of million in cash  including acquisition costs of million 
in addition  we assumed all the then outstanding options to purchase tacit common stock  and converted those into options to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock 
in addition to the cash paid that is included in the initial purchase price  the merger agreement required that million of cash be placed in an escrow account to secure tacit s obligations under certain representation and warranty provisions 
the escrow funds will be released fifteen days following the later of days after completion of the audit of our financial statements or one year from the closing date of the acquisition  at which time the final purchase price will be adjusted 
in connection with the acquisition  we have recorded million of goodwill  million of other intangible assets  and million of net tangible assets 
in addition  we wrote off acquired in process research and development  or ipr d  of million because the acquired technologies had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative uses 
the financial information presented for includes the results of tacit subsequent to the acquisition date

table of contents we believe that our current value proposition  which enables our enterprise customers to get more value out of existing network resources and improved performance of their critical applications  should allow us to grow our business again in our growth rate and net revenues depend significantly on continued growth in the wan application delivery market  our ability to develop and maintain strong partnering relationships with our indirect channel partners and our ability to expand or enhance our current product offerings or respond to technological change 
our growth in service revenues is dependent upon increasing the number of units under maintenance  which is dependent on both growing our installed base and renewing existing maintenance contracts 
our future profitability and rate of growth  if any  will be directly affected by the continued acceptance of our product in the marketplace  as well as the timing and size of orders and shipments  product mix  average selling price of our products and general economic conditions 
our failure to successfully convince the market of our value proposition and maintain strong relationships with our indirect channel partners to ensure the success of their selling efforts on our behalf  would adversely impact our net revenues and operating results 
our future revenue and profitability may also be impacted by future acquisitions 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns  inventory valuation  rebate and warranty reserves  valuation of long lived assets  including intangible assets and goodwill  income taxes and stock based compensation  among others 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  we believe the accounting policies below are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
revenue recognition 
we apply the provisions of statement of position  or sop   software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  to all transactions involving the sale of hardware and software products 
revenue is generally recognized when all of the following criteria are met  as set forth in paragraph of sop persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
receipt of a customer purchase order is persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
sales through our distribution channel are evidenced by an agreement governing the relationship together with purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
delivery generally occurs when product is delivered to a common carrier from packeteer or its designated fulfillment house 
for certain destinations outside the americas  delivery occurs when product is delivered to the destination country 
for maintenance contracts  delivery is deemed to occur ratably over the contract period 
our fees are typically considered to be fixed or determinable at the inception of an arrangement and are negotiated at the outset of an arrangement  generally based on specific products and quantities to be delivered 
in the event payment terms are provided that differ significantly from our standard business practices  which are generally ninety days or less  the fees are deemed to not be fixed or determinable and revenue is recognized as the fees become due and payable 

table of contents we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including credit worthiness of the customer and past transaction history of the customer 
generally  product revenue is recognized upon delivery 
however  product revenue on sales to major new distributors are recorded based on sell through to the end user customers until such time as we have established significant experience with the distributor s product exchange activity 
additionally  when we introduce new product into our distribution channel for which there is no historical customer demand or acceptance history  revenue is recognized on the basis of sell through to end user customers until such time as demand or acceptance history has been established 
we defer recognition of revenue on inventory in the distribution channel in excess of a certain number of days 
on the same basis  we reduce the associated cost of revenues  which is primarily related to materials  and include this amount in inventory 
we recognize these revenues and associated cost of revenues when the inventory levels no longer exceed expected supply 
no amounts were deferred under this policy as of december  or we have analyzed all of the elements included in our multiple element arrangements and have determined that we have sufficient vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value to allocate revenue to the maintenance component of our product and to training 
vsoe of fair value is based upon separate sales of maintenance renewals and training to customers 
accordingly  assuming other revenue recognition criteria are met  revenue from product sales is recognized upon delivery using the residual method in accordance with sop revenue from maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term and revenue from training is recognized when the training has taken place 
to date  training revenues have not been material 
inventory valuation 
inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
we record inventory write downs for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical usage and forecasted demand 
factors which could cause our forecasted demand to prove inaccurate include our reliance on indirect sales channels and the variability of our sales cycle  the potential of announcements of our new products or enhancements to replace or shorten the life cycle of our current products  or cause customers to defer their purchases  loss of sales due to product shortages  and the potential of new or alternative technologies achieving widespread market acceptance and thereby rendering our existing products obsolete 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we test goodwill for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level reporting unit at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events  as defined by sfas consistent with our determination that we have only one reporting segment as defined in sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  we have determined that we have only one reporting unit 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually on december in a two step process 
first  we determine if the carrying amount of our reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  which would indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
if we determine that goodwill may be impaired  we compare the implied fair value of the goodwill  as defined by sfas  to our carrying amount to determine if there is an impairment loss 
we do not have any goodwill that we consider to be impaired 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluate long lived assets  including intangible assets other than goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset 
sales return reserve 
in accordance with sfas  revenue recognition when right of return exists  management must use judgment and make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
when providing for sales return reserves  we analyze historical return rates  as we believe they are the primary indicator of possible future returns 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our 
table of contents revenues if for any period actual returns differ from our judgments or estimates 
the sales return reserve balances at december  and were million and million  respectively 
rebate reserves 
certain distributors and resellers can earn rebates under several of our programs 
the rebates earned are recorded in accordance with emerging issues task force  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendors products 
for established programs  our estimates for rebates are based on historical usage rates 
for new programs  rebate reserves are calculated to cover our maximum exposure until such time as historical usage rates are developed 
when sufficient historical experience is established  there may be a reversal of previously accrued rebates if actual rebate claims are less than the maximum exposure 
additionally  there may be a reversal of previously accrued rebate reserves if rebates are not claimed before the expiration dates established for each program 
rebate reserves at december  and were million and million  respectively 
warranty reserves 
upon shipment of products to our customers  we provide for the estimated cost to repair or replace products that may be returned under warranty 
our warranty period is typically months from the date of shipment to the end user customer 
for existing products  the reserve is estimated based on actual historical experience 
for new products  the warranty reserve is based on historical experience of similar products until such time as sufficient historical data has been collected on the new product 
factors that may impact our warranty costs in the future include our reliance on our contract manufacturer to provide quality products and the complexity of our products which may contain undetected defects  errors or failures in either the hardware or the software 
to date  these problems have not materially adversely affected us 
warranty reserves amounted to  and  at december  and  respectively 
stock based compensation 
effective january   we began accounting for stock options and espp shares under the provisions of sfas r  which requires the recognition of the fair value of equity based compensation 
the fair value of stock options and espp shares was estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
this model requires the input of subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility and estimated life of each award 
the fair value of equity based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award  net of estimated forfeitures  and we have elected to use the graded option method 
we make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of the tax credit pool to determine if there are any deficiencies that require recognition in the consolidated statements of operations 
prior to the implementation of sfas r  we accounted for stock options and employee stock purchase plan  or espp  shares under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and made pro forma footnote disclosures as required by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amended sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share disclosed in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements were estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
the fair value of restricted shares issued in connection with an acquisition was calculated based upon the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information and related disclosures 
accounting for income taxes 
we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes pursuant to sfas accordingly  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  including assessing the risks associated with tax audits  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
due to the evolving nature of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate  it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability could change in the future  which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
sfas provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that those deferred tax assets will be realized 
management reviews deferred tax assets periodically for recoverability and makes estimates and judgments regarding the expected geographic sources of taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value 

table of contents factors such as our cumulative profitability in the us and our projected future taxable income were the key criteria in deciding to release a portion of the valuation allowance 
if the estimates and assumptions used in our determination change in the future  we could be required to revise our estimates of the valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets and adjust our provisions for additional income taxes 
quantification of errors 
in september  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  which addresses how uncorrected errors in previous years should be considered when quantifying errors in current year financial statements 
sab requires companies to consider both a rollover method which focuses primarily on the income statement impact of misstatements and the iron curtain method which focuses primarily on the balance sheet impact of misstatements when quantifying errors in current year financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures 
the transition provisions of sab permit a company to adjust retained earnings accumulated deficit for the cumulative effect of immaterial errors relating to prior years 
in the three months ended december  we determined that errors had been made in our financial statements related to the recording of rebate reserves  resulting in an overstatement of rebate reserves of  net of taxes of  historically  we have evaluated uncorrected differences utilizing the rollover approach 
we believe the impact of these errors were immaterial to prior years under the rollover method 
however  under sab  which we were required to adopt for the year ended december   we must assess materiality using both the rollover method and the iron curtain method 
under the iron curtain method  the cumulative impact of the errors are material to our financial statements and  therefore  we have recorded an adjustment to our opening accumulated deficit balance in the amount of  in accordance with the implementation guidance in sab the impact on accumulated deficit is comprised of the following amounts in thousands years ended december  total accumulated deficit net revenues provision for income taxes total  net of tax results of operations the following table includes selected consolidated statements of operations data for all quarters of the periods indicated in thousands  except per share amounts quarter ended december  september  june  march  net revenues gross profit income loss from operations net income loss basic net income loss per share diluted net income loss per share

our overhead costs consist primarily of personnel related costs for our product operations and order fulfillment groups and other product costs such as warranty and fulfillment charges 
service support costs consist primarily of personnel related costs for our customer support and training groups  as well as fees paid to third party service providers to facilitate next business day replacement for end user customers located outside the united states 
additionally  we allocate overhead such as facilities  depreciation and it costs to all departments based on headcount and usage 
as such  general overhead costs are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category 
we must continue to work closely with our contract manufacturers as we develop and introduce new products and try to reduce production costs for existing products

we expect service costs to continue at the higher levels reflected in as a result of the increase in the number of units under maintenance contracts 
in connection with the acquisition of tacit  we recorded million of purchased intangible assets related to developed technology that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of three years 
in  amortization expense of  related to these intangibles was included in cost of revenues 
in connection with the acquisition of mentat in  we recorded million of purchased intangible assets that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of one to six years

in process research and development our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to acquisitions to ipr d was determined through established valuation techniques in the high technology networking product industry 
ipr d expense for was million for acquired ipr d related to the acquisition of tacit 
ipr d was expensed upon the closing of the acquisition during the three months ended june  because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed 
the fair value of the existing purchased technology  as well as the technology under development  was determined using the income approach  which estimates the present value of future economic benefits such as cash earnings  cost savings  tax deductions  and proceeds from disposition 
the present value calculations were developed by discounting expected cash flows to the present value at a rate of return that incorporates the risk free rate for the use of funds  the expected rate of inflation  and risks associated with the particular investment 
the discount rate of selected was generally based on rates of return available from alternative investments of similar type and quality 
the ipr d expense for related primarily to projects associated with tacit s ishared wan optimization technology including the hardware appliance and the related software enhancements and upgrades 
the projects identified as in process technology are those that were underway at the time of the tacit acquisition and  at the date of acquisition  required additional effort to establish technological feasibility 
the successful completion of these projects was a significant risk at the date of acquisition due to the remaining efforts to achieve technical viability  rapidly changing customer markets  uncertain standards for new products  and significant competitive threats 
if an identified project is not successfully completed  there is no alternative future use for the project and the expected future income will not be realized 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  consists primarily of investment income from our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
interest and other income  net increased to million in from million in and from million in the increase in from was due to increased investment yields  partially offset by lower average balances of invested funds 
the increase in from was due to increases in yields and higher balances of invested funds 
income tax provision benefit we recorded a tax provision of  for  reflecting an effective tax rate for the year of

table of contents revision of original estimates of the prior year tax provision upon preparation of the related tax return  partially offset by other adjustments 
absent these items  we would have recorded a tax benefit of approximately million  which is primarily related to the utilization of tax credits 
for  we recorded a tax provision of  reflecting the release of million of our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
without the release  our effective rate would have been approximately instead of the provision that we reported 
our tax provision in was also impacted by a relative decrease in earnings subject to taxation in countries that have lower statutory tax rates and an increase in non deductible stock compensation  compared to for  we realized a tax benefit of  reflecting the release of a portion of our valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
without the release  our effective rate would have been approximately instead of the benefit that we reported 
our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors  such as tax legislation  the geographic composition of our pre tax income  and non tax deductible stock compensation expenses 
we carefully monitor these factors and timely adjust the effective income tax rate accordingly 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return that results in a tax benefit 
additionally  fin provides guidance on de recognition  statement of operations classification of interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are evaluating the effect that the adoption of fin will have on our results of operations and financial condition and are not yet in a position to determine such effects 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurement  sfas 
this standard defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years

net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities net change in cash and cash equivalents the decrease was primarily due to million used in the acquisition of tacit  net of cash and investments acquired  including million held in escrow  partially offset by net cash provided by operating activities of million and proceeds from the issuance of stock through option exercises and the espp totaling million 
in addition  million was used for purchases of property and equipment 
in  although we recorded net income of million  we generated million in cash from operations primarily due to adjustments for non cash items primarily depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation 
our uses of cash for net working capital included increases of accounts receivable  partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue 
we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors  including fluctuations in our operating results  shipment linearity  accounts receivable collections  and excess tax benefits from stock based compensation 
shipment linearity is a measure of the level of shipments throughout a particular quarter 
accounts receivable  net 
the following table summarizes our accounts receivable  net in thousands 
december  increase decrease accounts receivable  net the increase in net accounts receivable was due to increased sales and a decreased shipment linearity in the three months ended december  days sales outstanding dso as of december  and was days and days  respectively 
our dso is primarily impacted by shipment linearity and collections performance 
a steady level of shipments and good collections performance will result in reduced dso compared with a higher level of shipments toward the end of a quarter  which will result in a shorter amount of time to collect the related accounts receivable and increased dso 
deferred revenue 
the following table summarizes our deferred revenue  net in thousands 
december  increase decrease current deferred revenue long term deferred revenue total the increase in deferred service revenue reflects the impact of the increase in the number of units under maintenance contract and renewals  partially offset by the ongoing amortization of deferred maintenance revenue 
contractual obligations we have contractual obligations in the form of operating leases 
these are described in further detail in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
additionally  we have purchase obligations reflecting open purchase order commitments  including  of third party licensing contract commitments 

table of contents the following chart details our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than contractual obligations total year years years cash obligations not reflected in consolidated balance sheet operating lease obligations purchase obligations total in january  we entered into an amendment to extend the term of the lease of our cupertino  california facilities through december and to expand the premises subject to the lease 
the lease payments under the amended lease  which will begin in december  will be approximately million per year  with a total commitment of million over the extended lease term 
this amount is not reflected in the above chart 
liquidity and capital resource requirements during the past three years  we have had sufficient financial resources to meet our operating requirements  to fund our capital spending and to repay our bank line of credit 
we expect to experience growth in our working capital needs for at least the next twelve months in order to execute our business plan 
we anticipate that operating activities  as well as planned capital expenditures  will constitute a partial use of our cash resources 
in addition  we may utilize cash resources to fund additional acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses  technologies or products 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and investments of million at december  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
however  we may need to raise additional funds if our estimates of revenues  working capital or capital expenditure requirements change or prove inaccurate or in order for us to respond to unforeseen technological or marketing hurdles or to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities 
these funds may not be available at the time or times needed  or available on terms acceptable to us 
if adequate funds are not available  or are not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities to develop new products or to otherwise respond to competitive pressures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk fixed income investments our exposure to market risks for changes in interest rates and principal relates primarily to investments in debt securities issued by us government agencies and corporate debt securities 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of the credit exposure to any one issuer 
our investment securities are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
in general our policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk 
all highly liquid investments with less than three months to maturity from date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents  investments with maturities between three and twelve months are considered to be short term investments  and investments with maturities in excess of twelve months from the balance sheet date are considered to be long term investments 
at december   our investment portfolio included fixed income securities with a fair value of approximately million  having an average duration of years 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
based on our investment portfolio at december   an immediate increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of the portfolio of approximately  while an increase in interest rates reduces the fair value of the investment portfolio  
table of contents we will not realize the losses in the consolidated statements of operations unless the individual fixed income securities are sold prior to recovery or the loss is determined to be other than temporarily impaired 
foreign exchange we develop products in the united states and sell in north america  asia  europe and the rest of the world 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in worldwide markets 
all sales are currently made in us dollars  and as a result  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
all operating costs outside the united states are incurred in local currencies  and are remeasured from the local currency to us dollars upon consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these operating costs  when remeasured  may differ from our prior performance and our expectations 
we have no foreign exchange contracts  option contracts or other foreign currency hedging arrangements
