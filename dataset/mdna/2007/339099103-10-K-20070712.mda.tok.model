units sold by the retail business were retail single section multi section includes sales of slide in truck camper units in fiscal year ended overview fleetwood is one of the nation s leaders in producing both recreational vehicles and manufactured housing 
the rv group sold  and  recreational vehicles in fiscal and  respectively 
in calendar  we had a share of the overall recreational vehicle retail market  consisting of a share of the motor home market  a share of the travel trailer market and a share of the folding trailer market 
the housing group produced and shipped  and  manufactured homes in fiscal and  respectively  including intercompany sales 
in calendar  we had a share of the manufactured housing wholesale market  making us the third largest producer of hud code homes in the u 
s 
based upon shipments to dealers 
the supply group operates two fiberglass manufacturing operations  a lumber brokerage business  and an imports sales and distributions operation that provide components for our manufactured housing and recreational vehicle operations  while also generating outside sales 
our business began in producing travel trailers and quickly evolved to what are now termed manufactured homes 
we re entered the recreational vehicle business with the acquisition of a travel trailer operation in our manufacturing activities are conducted in states within the us  and to a much lesser extent in mexico 
we distribute our manufactured products primarily through a network of independent dealers throughout the united states and canada 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
this requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and notes 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience factors and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following is a list of the accounting policies that we believe reflect our more significant judgments and estimates  and that could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
reclassifications certain amounts previously reported have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal presentation 
revenue recognition revenue for manufacturing operations is generally recorded when all of the following conditions have been met an order for a product has been received from a dealer  written or oral approval for payment has been received from the dealer s flooring institution  a carrier has signed the delivery ticket accepting responsibility for the product as agent for the dealer  and the product has been removed from fleetwood s property for delivery to the dealer who placed the order 
most manufacturing sales are made on cash terms  with most dealers financing their purchases under flooring arrangements with banks or finance companies 
products are not ordinarily sold on consignment  dealers do not generally have the right to return products  and dealers are responsible for interest costs to floorplan lenders 
on average  we receive payments from floorplan lenders on products sold to dealers within approximately days of the invoice date 
warranty we typically provide customers of our products with a one year warranty covering defects in material or workmanship with longer warranties on certain structural components 
this warranty period typically commences upon delivery to the end user of the product 
we record a liability based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to resolve future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
factors we use in estimating the warranty liability include a history of units sold to customers  the average cost incurred to repair a unit  and a profile of the distribution of warranty expenditures over the warranty period 
a significant increase in dealer shop rates  the cost of parts  or the frequency of claims could have an adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such claims or additional costs materialize 
insurance reserves generally  we are self insured for health benefits  workers compensation  and products liability insurance 
liabilities are recognized for claims incurred including those incurred but not reported  changes in the reserves related to prior claims  and an administration fee 
the liability for workers compensation claims is guided by state statute 
factors considered in establishing the estimated liability for products liability claims are the nature of the claim  the geographical region in which the claim originated  loss history  severity of the claim  the professional judgment of our legal counsel  and inflation 
any material change in these factors could have an adverse impact on our operating results 
we generally maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers to minimize our risks related to catastrophic claims or unexpectedly large cumulative claims 
deferred taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between income and expenses reported for financial reporting and tax reporting 
we are required to record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we historically had considered relevant positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  prudent and feasible tax planning strategies  projected future taxable income  and recent financial performance 
since we have had cumulative losses in recent years  the accounting guidance suggests that we should not look to future earnings to support the realizability of the net deferred tax asset 
beginning in fiscal  we concluded that a partial valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset was appropriate and have since made adjustments to the allowance as necessary  generally to give effect to changes in the amount of asset that can be supported by available tax planning strategies 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded a net adjustment to the deferred tax asset of million with a corresponding provision for income taxes 
the primary reason for this reduction was the realization of the deferred tax asset associated with the net gain of approximately million from the purchase and cancellation of  shares of the convertible trust preferred securities at per share compared to the book value of per share 
the potential to realize taxable income from the repurchase of the remaining securities outstanding is a tax planning strategy that continues to support a portion of the deferred tax asset 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a net adjustment to the deferred tax asset of million  with a corresponding provision for income taxes 
following a decision to market for sale certain real estate properties  these assets are no longer available as part of our tax planning strategy to support the realizability of the deferred tax asset 
the book value of the net deferred tax asset continues to be supported by tax planning strategies  which  if executed  are expected to generate sufficient taxable income to realize the book value of the remaining asset 
although we continue to believe that the combination of relevant positive and negative factors will enable us to realize the full value of the deferred tax assets  it is possible that the extent and availability of tax planning strategies will change over time and impact this evaluation 
if  after future assessments of the realizability of our deferred tax assets  we determine that further adjustment is required  we will record the provision or benefit in the period of such determination 
legal proceedings we are regularly involved in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business 
insurance covers all or part of fleetwood s liability under some of this litigation 
in the majority of cases  including products liability cases  we prepare estimates based on historical experience  the professional judgment of our legal counsel  and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to pending litigation and revise our estimates 
such revisions and any actual liability that greatly exceeds our estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
repurchase commitments producers of recreational vehicles and manufactured housing customarily enter into repurchase agreements with lending institutions that provide wholesale floorplan financing to independent dealers 
our agreements generally provide that  in the event of a default by a dealer in its obligation to these credit sources  we will repurchase product 
with most repurchase agreements  our obligation ceases when the amount for which we are contingently liable to the lending institution has been outstanding for more than  or months  depending on the terms of the agreement 
the contingent liability under these agreements approximates the outstanding principal balance owed by the dealer for units subject to the repurchase agreement less any scheduled principal payments waived by the lender 
although the maximum potential contingent repurchase liability approximated million for inventory at manufactured housing dealers and million for inventory at rv dealers as of april   the risk of loss is reduced by the potential resale value of any products that are subject to repurchase  and is spread over numerous dealers and financial institutions 
the gross repurchase obligation will vary depending on the season and the level of dealer inventories 
typically  the fiscal third quarter repurchase obligation will be greater than other periods due to higher rv dealer inventories 
losses and related repurchase reserves under these agreements have not been significant and lender repurchase demands have been funded out of working capital 
a summary of recent repurchase activity is set forth below dollars in millions units repurchase amount loss recognized business outlook recreational vehicles favorable demographics suggest that sustainable growth in the number of rv buyers will likely be realized in at least the next several years as baby boomers reach the age brackets that historically have accounted for the bulk of retail rv sales 
additionally  in recent years  younger buyers have also shown greater interest in the rv lifestyle 
these conclusions received strong support from the university of michigan national survey of recreational vehicle owners  sponsored by the recreation vehicle industry association 
industry conditions during calendar year  and so far in calendar  were adversely affected by concerns about interest rates  fuel prices and diminished home equity financings 
industry motor home retail sales posted a second year of decline in calendar  with most of the continued weakness in the higher end class a gas and mid and high priced class c segments 
recent market conditions and demand have been mixed  and a firm recovery has yet to materialize 
travel trailer retail sales were down slightly for the industry in calendar due to significant falloff in the latter part of the year and have shown continuing signs of weakness  combined with more competitive pricing thus far in calendar after briefly stabilizing in early calendar  the market for folding trailers is also showing weakness so far in calendar our overall market position in motor homes has been slightly impacted by lower industry demand in product segments that have traditionally been an area of relative strength for us 
we are  however  seeing a benefit from recent introductions of low end class a gas products and improvements made to several diesel brands 
in the class c category  we have introduced a completely new product in the currently popular entry level category and intend to introduce a fuel efficient model later this year 
our market share for travel trailers had been in decline for several years but began to stabilize during the middle of calendar following the launch of a number of new model year products 
these new products introduced last spring and summer have been well received by our dealers and appear to have gained shelf space on dealer lots 
industry retail demand for travel trailers was down towards the end of the year  however  causing dealers to reduce orders of new products until their inventories get back in balance with demand 
beginning in the third quarter  we rationalized our travel trailer plants and their respective products with an emphasis on achieving manufacturing efficiencies  improving quality and reducing the number of brands and floorplans produced at each factory location 
this process evolved in conjunction with our evaluation of plant capacity requirements given the recent downturn in the travel trailer market 
as a result  we closed four travel trailer plants during or shortly after our fourth fiscal quarter 
we will close a fifth plant before the end of the first fiscal quarter in fiscal we expect to see improved efficiencies in the remaining facilities as a result of higher production volume 
we may also see reduced market share in segments and regions in which we choose to no longer compete but expect to be more competitive in markets in which we place emphasis 
we are the dominant producer of folding trailers and our market share improved during calendar our focus will be on improving the efficiency and financial results of this operation in fiscal although our processes associated with manufacturing quality and service continue to improve for our entire rv business  the full benefits will only be realized over the longer term through lower warranty and service costs and a strong competitive advantage over other manufacturers 
housing we expect longer term demand for affordable housing to grow as a result of the rebuilding requirements in the gulf states  greater numbers of baby boomers reaching retirement age  and the continuing high cost of site built homes  notwithstanding the pricing pressures placed on conventional homes in certain regions due to the recent retrenchment by the subprime financing industry 
we believe that improvements in engineering and design will continue to position manufactured and modular homes as viable options in meeting the demand for affordable housing in new markets  such as suburban tracts and military sites  as well as in existing markets such as rural areas and manufactured housing communities and parks  especially over the longer term if retail financing for manufactured homes becomes more competitive versus financing for conventional housing 
despite these improvements  the manufactured housing market has experienced a steep decline that began in  and a year low in shipments was established in the industry has been adversely affected by a shortage of retail financing  relatively high retail interest rates especially when compared to low mortgage rates on conventional homes  more stringent lending standards for manufactured housing  and competition from repossessed manufactured homes and  more recently  foreclosed upon conventional homes 
many of the factors that have historically affected manufactured housing volumes have been in flux recently 
positive trends include a normalized inventory level of repossessed manufactured homes  improving performance of manufactured housing loan portfolios  tightening of credit for site built homes  and higher rents and lower vacancies in apartments 
on the other hand  the overall slowing of the housing market and an increase in conventional housing inventories may negatively impact manufactured housing conditions in the near term 
altogether  we anticipate that manufactured housing industry conditions may improve over the course of calendar  albeit modestly 
manufactured housing industry shipments decreased by percent in calendar  but were down nearer to excluding sales of homes that were built to fema specifications for disaster relief  which were estimated at  in calendar year and  in market conditions are mixed by region 
some smaller markets in the central states have shown improvement but other regions have softened 
california  arizona and florida  which traditionally have been some of our strongest markets  are down sharply in recent months 
the outlook in most areas continues to be uncertain 
our own market position was adversely affected by the sale of our retail operations in august this impact on our market position was expected given the immediate closure of approximately stores combined with reduced purchases by the remaining operating stores 
this situation will continue to affect our sales volume and market share until we fully replace or augment the closed outlets 
we also had fewer sales to national operators of manufactured home communities  which have significantly reduced their activity over the last months 
in response to these conditions  we have reduced manufacturing capacity by consolidating four plants into two during fiscal current activity in the gulf coast region by builders and developers is increasing with a substantial portion of the rebuilding efforts likely to include modular products  which we are prepared to provide 
development of this new distribution channel  combined with a longer sales cycle for these types of projects  will temper our progress in this area 
the sale of our network of company owned stores  which had a high concentration in the gulf coast region  may lessen our ability to fully participate in the upswing in more traditional dealer sales of manufactured housing until we can rebuild our independent dealer distribution network in the area 
in response to the weak market conditions  our dealers throughout the country are maintaining low inventory levels  and dealers in previously stronger markets such as arizona  california  and florida are continuing to reduce their inventories 
although this reduction of inventories impacts current order levels  it typically enables the dealers to continue to operate more profitably  albeit at a reduced level of activity 
the inventory reduction also enables dealers to dispose of older units so that when market conditions improve  they can quickly add new products 
despite this effort  dealer failures and losses from repurchase commitments are likely to increase in the current market climate and increased competition among manufacturers may squeeze margins 
we continue to initiate programs designed to increase our product representation by creating incentives for our sales personnel and dealers to sell aged inventory and replace it with new products on their lots 
in addition  we continue to focus on adding new distribution points 
we will also continue to pursue other opportunities to supplement our business  such as increased emphasis on sales of modular homes to builder developers and military projects 
summary we continue to place emphasis on new products in all areas of our business that are feature rich  innovative  and price competitive 
as a result  we generally expect to improve our market share position over the course of the next fiscal year 
restructuring actions  which were primarily focused on reducing corporate and other general and administrative expenses  have resulted in a more cost effective management structure that has been in full effect since the beginning of calendar market conditions in all segments remain at or below prior year levels and continue to slow our progress toward sustainable profitability 
also  the extent to which we are successful in our restructuring and turnaround of the travel trailer business will be a key element to our financial progress in fiscal at current sales volumes and gross margins  the recently completed plant and product rationalization will not be sufficient to generate profitable operations without further improvements in the efficiencies and or effectiveness of our manufacturing and service operations 
the travel trailer business is unlikely to see a profitable quarter of operations until such improvements have taken full effect  which we expect to occur over the next months 
overall  with the help of a seasonal uplift  new model year product introductions  lower costs  and capacities that are more in line with current demand  we expect operating income before interest and tax expense to be close to breakeven in the first quarter of fiscal results of operations the following table sets forth certain statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated fiscal years ended april net sales cost of products sold gross profit operating expenses other operating expenses  net operating income loss other income expense investment income interest expense other  net income loss from continuing operations before income taxes provision for income taxes net loss from continuing operations discontinued operations net loss consolidated results in fiscal year compared to fiscal year consolidated results the following table presents net loss and diluted loss per share for fiscal and amounts in thousands  except per share data amount of net sales amount of net sales change change net loss from continuing operations nm net loss diluted loss per share nm not meaningful the substantial increase to the net loss from continuing operations during fiscal stems from lower sales in all areas of our operations  partially offset by lower operating and other expenses net 
losses from discontinued operations following the sale of our retail and financial services businesses in calendar were significantly lower in fiscal and consisted of ongoing general and administrative expenses 
net sales the following table presents consolidated net sales by group for fiscal and amounts in thousands amount of net sales amount of net sales change change rv group housing group supply group intercompany sales net sales the prior year period included operating weeks rather than the typical weeks for the current year 
rv sales in fiscal were negatively impacted by the absence of travel trailer sales of emergency living units 
in addition  a softer motor home market early in the fiscal year affected the rest of the rv market segments late in our fiscal year 
housing group sales suffered from the loss of disaster relief sales  community park developer business that did not recur in the current year  decreased sales to the formerly company owned retail business  and general weakness in the housing market 
consolidated net sales  cost of sales  and gross profit the following table presents consolidated net sales  cost of sales  and gross profit for fiscal and amounts in thousands amount of net sales amount of net sales change change net sales cost of sales gross profit gross margin declined from a prior year level that was elevated by higher production volumes and manufacturing efficiencies associated with the disaster relief sales 
additionally  competitive markets and a shift away from higher margin products reduced consolidated gross margin 
operating expenses the following table presents operating expenses for fiscal and amounts in thousands amount of net sales amount of net sales change change selling warranty and service general and administrative operating expenses lower operating expenses  which include selling  warranty and service  and general and administrative expenses  were attributable to headcount and expense reductions from restructuring initiatives and lower incentive compensation costs 
also  lower warranty expense resulted from lower sales and a return to a more cost effective factory based service  rather than a centralized service operation 
other operating expenses  net other operating expense  net  in fiscal included approximately million for one time employee separation costs related to several plant closings and restructuring efforts  and million of impairment charges on idle facilities  partially offset by million of gains from the sale of idle facilities 
other operating expenses in fiscal consisted of million of severance costs  million of impairment charges on idle facilities  and a million gain on sales of fixed assets 
other income expense other income expense consisted of investment income  interest expense  and miscellaneous other income 
investment income increased to million from million in the prior year due to higher average interest rates earned on invested funds 
interest expense declined to million from million due to lower borrowings  the effect of the repayment of the deferred distributions on the convertible trust preferred securities in february  and the redemption of million in face value of the same securities in june  partially offset by interest expense of million recorded on the coleman judgment  pending the outcome of an appeals process 
the redemption also generated other income of million representing a pre tax gain on the purchase and resulted in the cancellation of one million shares or of the previously outstanding convertible trust preferred securities at a discount to par value 
provision for income taxes the current year tax provision was principally due to million of non cash adjustments to the carrying amount of the deferred tax asset as a result of changes in our tax planning strategies 
our decision to market for sale certain appreciated real estate properties reduced remaining unrealized gains that would be available to realize the carrying value of the deferred tax asset by million 
earlier in fiscal  the realization of gains from the repurchase of the convertible trust preferred securities at a discount to book value resulted in a similar adjustment in the amount of million 
the income tax provision also included state tax liabilities in several states  with no offsetting tax benefits in others 
the prior year tax provision resulted primarily from the effect of an increase in the partial valuation allowance attributed to our deferred tax assets of million 
this change resulted from a reduction in the estimated benefit of various available tax strategies  which  if executed  are intended to generate sufficient taxable income to realize the remaining net deferred tax asset 
recreational vehicles the following table presents rv group net sales by division for fiscal and amounts in thousands amount of net sales amount of net sales change change motor homes travel trailers folding trailers net sales recreational vehicle sales for the year fell  mainly due to the absence this year of million of travel trailer emergency shelter unit sales to fema 
the decline in motor home revenues was mainly due to a weak market as consumer concerns regarding volatile fuel prices and rising interest rates negatively affected the market 
the retail market for motor homes for calendar year was down compared to a drop of for our retail activity caused mainly by the lack of low priced and fuel efficient class c units in our product line 
we introduced two low priced class c models in the spring and expect to introduce a more fuel efficient class c product later in calendar travel trailer sales to independent dealers  which exclude million of fema sales to the gulf coast region in the prior year  were off  reflecting softer industry conditions that began in the latter part of the calendar year the retail market for travel trailers for calendar year was off after being positive for most of the year 
our retail sales for the same period were down by  mainly due to a lack of competitive products in several product segments in the early part of the year 
subsequently  we introduced new products and brands and  in the last six months through april  industry shipments declined versus our shipments declining only  providing strong evidence that our new products are being positively received by our dealers 
folding trailer revenues were up from the prior year despite a decrease of in unit sales  which reflects a shift in product mix to higher priced products 
the folding trailer retail market was off about for the calendar year  while sales of fleetwood s products were down only  resulting in market share growth from to for the year 
gross margin for the rv group declined from to reflecting elevated margins in the prior year generated by efficiencies from the production of  disaster relief units 
current year inefficiencies and incremental costs related to the introduction of a significant number of new products also contributed to the negative comparison 
motor home and folding trailer gross margins were favorably influenced by lower labor costs stemming from improved efficiencies in the current year 
operating expenses for the rv group were million  million lower than the prior year but higher as a percentage of sales  rising from in the prior year to for the current period 
the decrease in expenses was due to improved warranty costs and lower general and administrative expenses related to restructuring initiatives  partially offset by higher selling costs for the national dealer meeting and marketing materials for major new model introductions 
other operating expenses of million were up million from the prior year related mostly to restructuring costs from the closure of five travel trailer plants

in the current presentation  revenues for the retail business are included in the results of discontinued operations 
in addition to the continued effects of difficult industry conditions  the negative sales comparison reflects prior year sales of million in sales for hurricane disaster relief  million in sales to community park operators and million of intercompany sales to the sold retail business 
in the current year  those sales were substantially less or in the case of disaster relief  non existent 
manufactured homes are sold as single section or multi section units 
multi section units typically are built in two  three or four sections 
the average selling price per home increased over the prior year from  to  most of this change was attributable to abnormally low prices in the prior year related to a large number of shipments of special single section homes to assist in hurricane disaster relief 
excluding these special units  the average price per home increased  which more closely approximates material cost increases 
year over year  manufactured housing industry shipments for calendar were down to  a year low 
our unit volume for the similar period declined with single section sales off by and multi section homes down 
our overall market share  based on wholesale shipments for the calendar year  fell to from in calendar year the group s market share for multi section homes also fell from to  while its share of the single section market declined from to 
this loss of market share was principally attributed to the sale of company owned stores in august of the stores that were sold  approximately half were subsequently closed or are no longer buying fleetwood products 
additionally  sales to community and park operators were lower in the current period 
despite substantial sales related to the impact of hurricanes in and  the underlying manufactured housing market continued to be adversely affected by the limited availability of retail financing  as well as competition from conventional builders benefiting from low mortgage rates and more liberal financing 
in addition  traditionally strong manufactured housing markets  such as california  arizona  and parts of the southeast  particularly florida  developed weakness in calendar gross profit margins decreased from to  reflecting higher margins in the prior year associated with efficiencies from the production of  disaster relief units  aggressive pricing necessary to compete in a tightening market  higher labor costs from operating for partial weeks  and fixed manufacturing overheads being spread over fewer units 
operating expenses declined million or to million

a significant focus was placed on more effectively managing production schedules and improving plant efficiencies 
the additional unit volume from the production of emergency shelter units also enabled plants to operate with higher capacity utilization  particularly those in the travel trailer business  where margins had previously been negatively impacted from producing lower volumes of a wide variety of unique products 
also  the prior year margins were impacted by inefficiencies associated with vacillating rv production rates during the second half of fiscal to align inventories and supply with weakening demand 
certain areas of our business continued to experience rising raw material costs as prices for oil  aluminum  copper  and other commodities increased 
higher fuel prices also contributed to an increase in shipping costs 
operating expenses the following table presents operating expenses for fiscal and amounts in thousands amount of net sales amount of net sales change change selling warranty and service general and administrative operating expenses a restructuring of the housing sales organization contributed to a reduction in selling costs combined with lower overall expenditures on strategic ventures and marketing initiatives 
warranty expenses for both groups declined due to lower incurred warranty costs combined with lower reserves 
responsibility for service and warranty work was transitioned back to the manufactured housing and travel trailer plants during the year and this  combined with initiatives to manage quality issues  had a positive impact on costs in this area 
general and administrative expenses decreased due to lower workers compensation costs  consulting costs  and headcount reductions  partially offset by higher variable compensation costs

this was largely in line with the experience of the industry  which was impacted by adverse trends in consumer confidence stemming mostly from volatile fuel prices 
in calendar  we experienced market share growth in the class c and diesel segments with market erosion in the class a gas segment  primarily in the entry level and high line gas products 
travel trailer sales were up in fiscal compared to fiscal wholesale shipments benefited from the sale of emergency living units  which generated million of additional revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal sales to our traditional dealer network  in terms of units  decreased by approximately and underlying retail unit sales were down by in calendar compared to the previous year 
this continued a trend of eroding market share particularly in the higher priced fifth wheel travel trailer class to and conventional travel trailers to  that can be attributed to a mismatch of value and features in our products relative to the competition

we purchased and cancelled one million shares or of our previously outstanding convertible trust preferred securities in july the transaction price of per share represented a discount of approximately from the par value of per share  taking into account accrued and unpaid interest 
long term debt was reduced by million and we recorded a pre tax gain of approximately million in other income 
net cash used by discontinued operations was million compared to cash provided of million in the prior year 
the cash used in fiscal related mostly to administrative costs incurred in connection with the wind down of operations 
net cash generated by discontinued operations in the prior year generally related to the sale of company owned retail housing stores  partially offset by the repayment of related debt and operating losses for that period 
as a result of the above mentioned changes  cash and marketable investments decreased by million from million as of april   to million as of april  credit agreements in january  the agreement governing our credit facility with a syndicate of lenders led by bank of america was renewed and extended until july  we originally entered into the agreement in july  and it was amended on several occasions prior to the most recent renewal 
the new amended and restated agreement incorporates prior amendments and makes additional changes  but continues to provide for a revolving credit facility  a term loan  and a real estate sub facility to the revolver 
in the january renewal  at our request  gross loan commitments for the three components of the facility were reduced to million from may through november  with a seasonal uplift to million from december through april 
the reduced size of the commitments  in part  reflects our exit from the manufactured housing retail and financial services businesses  which were designated as discontinued operations and subsequently sold in the second quarter of fiscal the size of the new facility more closely matches the availability provided by the current borrowing base 
the commitments to the term loan and real estate sub facility  which had been reduced through quarterly amortization to net values of million and million  respectively  at the end of our fiscal year were subsequently increased by million and million  respectively  with the completion of updated real estate appraisals in june in addition  when appraisals were updated and the term loan was increased  the maturity date of the term loan was extended from july  to july  on the first day of each fiscal quarter beginning january   we are required to repay  in principal on the term loan and the ability to borrow under the real estate sub facility is reduced by the amended facility continues to include restrictions regarding additional indebtedness  business operations  liens  guaranties  transfers and sales of assets  and transactions with subsidiaries or affiliates 
the amended facility also contains customary events of default that would permit the lenders to accelerate repayment of borrowings under the amended facility if not cured within applicable grace periods  including the failure to make timely payments under the amended facility or other material indebtedness and the failure to meet certain covenants 
under the prior facility  real estate with an approximate appraised value of million was pledged as security  which included excess collateral of million 
under the amended facility  total real estate collateral was reduced to approximately million  and the excess collateral component reduced to million 
the reduction of over million in collateral was driven by the lower loan commitments under the amended facility 
in may  the credit facility was further amended to reset the financial performance covenant at levels that more closely approximate our expectations of future operating results 
as part of the amendment  we agreed to restore million in real estate collateral to the excess collateral pool for the benefit of the syndicate  increasing the total of such excess collateral to million 
after giving effect to the extended maturity date of the term loan  the aggregate short term balance outstanding on the revolver and term loan was million as of april  and million as of april  an additional million of the term loan was included in long term borrowings as of april   and an additional million of the term loan was included in long term borrowings as of april  the revolving credit line and term loan bear interest  at our option  at variable rates based on either bank of america s prime rate or one  two or three month libor 
as of april   the net loan commitments for the credit facility stood at million  comprised of million for the revolver and million for the term loan 
our borrowing capacity  however  is governed by the amount of a borrowing base  consisting primarily of inventories and accounts receivable  that fluctuate significantly 
the borrowing base is revised weekly for changes in receivables and monthly for changes in inventory balances 
at year end  the borrowing base totaled million 
after consideration of outstanding borrowings and standby letters of credit of million  unused borrowing capacity availability was approximately million 
borrowings are secured by receivables  inventory and certain other assets  primarily real estate  and are used for working capital and general corporate purposes 
under the senior credit agreement  fleetwood enterprises  inc is a guarantor of the borrowings and letters of credit of its wholly owned subsidiary  fleetwood holdings  inc we are subject to a springing covenant that requires minimum levels of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization  but only if our average daily liquidity  defined as cash  cash equivalents  and unused borrowing capacity  falls below a prescribed minimum level 
this minimum  which is measured monthly  was also reduced under the january renewal from million to million 
in addition  the current agreement requires testing of the covenant if liquidity falls below million on any single day or average daily availability is below million in any particular month 
dividends and distributions on october   we announced that we would discontinue the payment of dividends 
any future resumption of dividends on our common stock would be at the discretion of our board of directors  and is not currently contemplated 
other in the opinion of management  the combination of existing cash resources  expected future cash flows from operations  and available lines of credit will be sufficient to satisfy our foreseeable cash requirements for the next months  including up to million for capital expenditures in fiscal  to be utilized primarily for enhancements to manufacturing facilities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on marketable investments  investments underlying a company owned life insurance program coli  and variable rate debt under the secured credit facility 
in addition  market related changes to our convertible trust preferred securities indirectly may impact the amount of the deferred tax valuation allowance  which currently depends on available tax strategies  including the unrealized gains on these securities 
we do not currently use interest rate swaps  futures contracts or options on futures  or other types of derivative financial instruments 
the vast majority of our marketable investments are in institutional money market funds or fixed rate securities with average original maturity dates of two weeks or less  minimizing the effect of interest rate fluctuations on their fair value 
with respect to the company owned life insurance program  the underlying investments are subject to both interest rate risk and equity market risk 
for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not influence fair market value  but do affect future earnings and cash flows 
based upon the amount of variable rate debt outstanding at the end of the year  and holding the variable rate debt balance constant  each one percentage point increase in interest rates occurring on the first day of an annual period would result in an increase in interest expense of approximately  for both fixed rate loans and debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value  but not earnings or cash flows 
currently  the effects of such changes on our financial statements are not expected to be material 
we do not believe that future market equity or interest rate risks related to our marketable investments or debt obligations will have a material impact on our results
