overview of earnings performance net income of the company was million  or per basic share  and per diluted share  for compared to million  or per basic share  and per diluted share  for income before tax increased million  or  for fiscal year compared to this increase was primarily due to an increase of million in net interest income as a result of the growth in interest earning assets 
the overall slight decline of  in net income for the comparative periods was due to an increase in the provision for income taxes of million for over net income for was positively impacted by the resolution of tax issues  which resulted in a  credit to the provision for income taxes 
the company s earnings performance was also impacted in by net loan portfolio growth of million  or  primarily in manufactured housing  commercial real estate  commercial  and sba loans which contributed to increased net interest income over the comparative periods despite a challenging interest rate environment 
net interest income was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
despite a basis point increase in the federal reserve board s target federal funds rate from to  the combination of a flattening  and even inverted  yield curve and intense competition for both loans and deposits continued to compress interest margins  which resulted in a decline in net interest margin to from 
continued efforts to control expenses while striving to improve service levels to customers  which resulted in improvement in the company s efficiency ratio to for from and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the impact to the company from these items  and others of both a positive and negative nature  will be discussed in more detail as they pertain to the company s overall comparative performance for the year ended december  throughout the analysis sections of this report 
critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
provision and allowance for loan losses the company maintains a detailed  systematic analysis and procedural discipline to determine the amount of the allowance for loan losses all 
the all is based on estimates and is intended to be adequate to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
this process involves deriving probable loss estimates that are based on individual loan loss estimation  migration analysis historical loss rates and management s judgment 
the company employs several methodologies for estimating probable losses 
methodologies are determined based on a number of factors  including type of asset  risk rating  concentrations  collateral value and the input of the special assets group  functioning as a workout unit 
the all calculation for the different major loan types is as follows sba all loans are reviewed and classified loans are assigned a specific allowance 
those not classified are assigned a pass rating 
a migration analysis and various portfolio specific factors are used to calculate the required allowance on those pass loans 
relationship banking includes commercial  commercial real estate and consumer loans 
classified loans are assigned a specific allowance 
a migration analysis and various portfolio specific factors are used to calculate the required allowance on the remaining pass loans 
manufactured housing an allowance is calculated on the basis of risk rating  which is a combination of delinquency  value of collateral on classified loans and perceived risk in the product line 
securitized loans the company considers this a homogeneous portfolio and calculates the allowance based on statistical information provided by the servicer 
charge off history is calculated based on two methodologies  a month historical trend analysis and by delinquency information 
the highest requirement of the two methods is used 
the company calculates the required all on a monthly basis 
any difference between estimated and actual observed losses from the prior month are reflected in the current period required all calculation and adjusted as deemed necessary 
the review of the adequacy of the allowance takes into consideration such factors as concentrations of credit  changes in the growth  size and composition of the loan portfolio  overall and individual portfolio quality  review of specific problem loans  collateral  guarantees and economic conditions that may affect the borrowers ability to pay and or the value of the underlying collateral 
additional factors considered include geographic location of borrowers  changes in the company s product specific credit policy and lending staff experience 
these estimates depend on the outcome of future events and  therefore  contain inherent uncertainties 
the company s all is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb known and inherent probable losses on existing loans 
a provision for loan losses is charged to expense 
the allowance is charged for losses when management believes that full recovery on the loan is unlikely 
generally  the company charges off any loan classified as a loss  portions of loans which are deemed to be uncollectible  overdrafts which have been outstanding for more than days  and  all other unsecured loans past due or more days 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the all 
interest only strips and servicing rights the guaranteed portion of certain sba loans can be sold into the secondary market 
servicing rights are recognized as separate assets when loans are sold with servicing retained 
servicing rights are amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  estimated future net servicing income 
the company uses industry prepayment statistics and its own prepayment experience in estimating the expected life of the loans 
management periodically evaluates servicing rights for impairment 
servicing rights are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to amortized cost on a loan by loan basis 
fair value is determined using discounted future cash flows calculated on a loan by loan basis and aggregated to the total asset level 
the initial servicing rights and resulting gain on sale are calculated based on the difference between the best actual par and premium bids on an individual loan basis 
additionally  on certain sba loan sales that occurred prior to  the company retained interest only strips i o strips  which represent the present value of excess net cash flows generated by the difference between a interest at the stated rate paid by borrowers and b the sum of i pass through interest paid to third party investors and ii contractual servicing fees 
the company has not created any new i o strips since the i o strips are classified as trading securities 
accordingly  the company records the i o strips at fair value with the resulting increase or decrease in fair value being recorded through operations in the current period 
quarterly  the company verifies the reasonableness of its valuation estimates by comparison to the results of an independent third party valuation analysis 
other real estate owned other real estate owned oreo is real estate acquired through foreclosure on the collateral property and is recorded at fair value at the time of foreclosure less estimated costs to sell 
any excess of loan balance over the fair value of the oreo is charged off against the allowance for loan losses 
subsequent to foreclosure  management periodically performs a new valuation and the asset is carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value 
operating expenses or income  and gains or losses on disposition of such properties  are recorded in current operations 
stock based compensation on january   the company changed its accounting policy related to stock based compensation in connection with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment revised sfas no 
r 
prior to january   employee compensation expense under stock option plans was reported only if options were granted below market price at grant date in accordance with the intrinsic value method of accounting 
because the exercise price of the company s employee stock options always equaled the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense was recognized on options granted 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r r on january  r eliminated the ability to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method and requires that such transactions be recognized as compensation cost in the income statement based on their fair values on the measurement date  which is generally the date of the grant 
the company transitioned to the fair value based accounting for stock based compensation using a modified version of prospective application mpa 
under mpa  as it is applicable to the company  r applies to new awards modified  repurchased or cancelled after january  additionally  compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered generally referring to non vested awards that were outstanding as of january  is recognized as the remaining requisite service is rendered during the period of and or the periods after the adoption of r 
the attribution of compensation cost for those earlier awards is based on the same method and on the same grant date fair values previously determined for the pro forma disclosures required for companies that did not previously adopt the fair value accounting method for stock based employee compensation 
the fair value of the company s employee stock options granted is estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
this model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  changes to which can materially affect the fair value estimate 
one such assumption  expected volatility  can have a significant impact on stock option valuation 
in developing this assumption  the company relies on historical volatility using both company specific and industry information 
additionally  there may be other factors that would otherwise have a significant effect on the value of employee stock options granted but are not considered by the model 
accordingly  management believes that the black scholes option pricing model provides a reasonable estimate of fair value

changes in interest income and interest expense the company primarily earns income from the management of its financial assets and liabilities and from charging fees for services it provides 
the company s income from managing assets consists of the difference between the interest income received from its loan portfolio and investments and the interest expense paid on its funding sources  primarily interest paid on deposits 
this difference or spread is net interest income 
the amount by which interest income will exceed interest expense depends on the volume or balance of earning assets compared to the volume or balance of interest bearing deposits and liabilities and the interest rate earned on those interest earning assets compared to the interest rate paid on those interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income  when expressed as a percentage of average total interest earning assets  is referred to as net interest margin on interest earning assets 
the company s net interest income is affected by the change in the level and the mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  referred to as volume changes 
the company s net yield on interest earning assets is also affected by changes in the yields earned on assets and rates paid on liabilities  referred to as rate changes 
interest rates charged on the company s loans are affected principally by the demand for such loans  the supply of money available for lending purposes  competitive factors and general economic conditions such as federal economic policies  legislative tax policies and governmental budgetary matters 
to maintain its net interest margin  the company must manage the relationship between interest earned and paid

the increase in interest expense is primarily due to increased competition for core deposits which resulted in higher deposit rates and increased use of wholesale funding sources to fund loan growth and will likely continue for the foreseeable future 
interest income from loans increased primarily due to overall net growth in the loan portfolio

interest income from interest earning deposits in other institutions declined slightly for compared to while the overall increase in net interest income was driven by loan growth  net interest income related to rate change experienced a decline 
this is reflected in the decline in margin by basis points from in to in the decline was due to an increase in the cost of the company s interest bearing liabilities  which was driven by continual increases in the short term interest rates from june through the first half of  and the ensuing higher competitive deposit pricing environment

in management s opinion  the balance of the allowance for loan losses was sufficient to absorb known and inherent probable losses in the loan portfolio as of december  nonaccrual  past due and restructured loans a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest under the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status  collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments 
loans that experience insignificant payment delays or payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired 
management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case by case basis 
when determining the possibility of impairment  management considers the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower  including the length of the delay  the reasons for the delay  the borrower s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed 
for collateral dependent loans  the company uses the fair value of collateral method to measure impairment 
all other loans  except for securitized  are measured for impairment based on the present value of future cash flows 
impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for all loans in the portfolio except for the securitized loans  which are evaluated for impairment on a collective basis

capital resources the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia contains rules as to the legal and regulatory environment for insured depository institutions  including reductions in insurance coverage for certain kinds of deposits  increased supervision by the federal regulatory agencies  increased reporting requirements for insured institutions and new regulations concerning internal controls  accounting and operations 
the prompt corrective action regulations of fdicia define specific capital categories based on the institutions capital ratios 
the capital categories  in declining order  are well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
to be considered well capitalized  an institution must have a core capital ratio of at least and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
additionally  fdicia imposed in a new tier i risk based capital ratio of at least to be considered well capitalized 
tier i risk based capital is  primarily  common stock and retained earnings  net of goodwill and other intangible assets

the company does not anticipate any material changes in its capital resources 
cwbc has common equity only and does not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
the company has not repurchased any stock nor does it have any immediate plans or programs to do so 
liquidity management the company has established policies as well as analytical tools to manage liquidity 
proper liquidity management ensures that sufficient funds are available to meet normal operating demands in addition to unexpected customer demand for funds  such as high levels of deposit withdrawals or increased loan demand  in a timely and cost effective manner 
the most important factor in the preservation of liquidity is maintaining public confidence that facilitates the retention and growth of core deposits 
ultimately  public confidence is gained through profitable operations  sound credit quality and a strong capital position 
the company s liquidity management is viewed from a long term and short term perspective  as well as from an asset and liability perspective 
management monitors liquidity through regular reviews of maturity profiles  funding sources and loan and deposit forecasts to minimize funding risk 
the company has asset liability committees alco at the board and bank management level to review asset liability management and liquidity issues 
the company maintains strategic liquidity and contingency plans 
periodically  the company has used short term time certificates from other financial institutions to meet projected liquidity needs 
cwb has a credit line with the federal home loan bank fhlb 
advances are collateralized in the aggregate by cwb s eligible mortgage loans and securities of the u 
s government and its agencies 
the outstanding advances at december  include million borrowed at variable rates which adjust to the current libor rate either monthly or quarterly and million borrowed at fixed rates 
at december   cwb had pledged to fhlb  securities of million at carrying value and loans of million  and had million available for additional borrowing 
at december   cwb had million of loans and million of securities pledged as collateral and outstanding advances of million 
cwb also maintains three federal funds purchased lines for a total borrowing capacity of million 
the company  through the bank  also has the ability as a member of the federal reserve system  to borrow at the discount window up to of what is pledged at the federal reserve bank 
the company has not experienced disintermediation and does not believe this is a potentially probable occurrence 
however  in a highly competitive marketplace  cwb s core deposits excluding certificates of deposit declined by million in and the company utilized more wholesale funding sources to help fund loan growth 
the liquidity ratio of the company was at december  compared to at december  the company s liquidity ratio fluctuates in conjunction with loan funding demands 
the liquidity ratio consists of cash and due from banks  deposits in other financial institutions  available for sale investments  federal funds sold and loans held for sale  divided by total assets 
cwbc s routine funding requirements primarily consist of certain operating expenses 
normally  cwbc obtains funding to meet its obligations from dividends collected from its subsidiary and has the capability to issue debt securities 
federal banking laws regulate the amount of dividends that may be paid by banking subsidiaries without prior approval 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to different types of interest rate risks 
these risks include lag  repricing  basis and prepayment risk 
lag risk lag risk results from the inherent timing difference between the repricing of the company s adjustable rate assets and liabilities 
for instance  certain loans tied to the prime rate index may only reprice on a quarterly basis 
however  at a community bank such as cwb  when rates are rising  funding sources tend to reprice more slowly than the loans 
therefore  for cwb  the effect of this timing difference is generally favorable during a period of rising interest rates and unfavorable during a period of declining interest rates 
this lag can produce some short term volatility  particularly in times of numerous prime rate changes 
repricing risk repricing risk is caused by the mismatch in the maturities repricing periods between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
if cwb was perfectly matched  the net interest margin would expand during rising rate periods and contract during falling rate periods 
this is so since loans tend to reprice more quickly than do funding sources 
typically  since cwb is somewhat asset sensitive  this would also tend to expand the net interest margin during times of interest rate increases 
basis risk item pricing tied to different indices may tend to react differently  however  all cwb s variable products are priced off the prime rate 
prepayment risk prepayment risk results from borrowers paying down off their loans prior to maturity 
prepayments on fixed rate products increase in falling interest rate environments and decrease in rising interest rate environments 
since a majority of cwb s loan originations are adjustable rate and set based on prime  and there is little lag time on the reset  cwb does not experience significant prepayments 
however  cwb does have more prepayment risk on its securitized and manufactured housing loans and its mortgage backed investment securities 
management of interest rate risk to mitigate the impact of changes in market interest rates on the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the amounts and maturities are actively managed 
short term  adjustable rate assets are generally retained as they have similar repricing characteristics as our funding sources 
cwb sells mortgage products and a portion of its sba loan originations 
while the company has some interest rate exposure in excess of five years  it has internal policy limits designed to minimize risk should interest rates rise 
currently  the company does not use derivative instruments to help manage risk  but will consider such instruments in the future if the perceived need should arise 
loan sales the company s ability to originate  purchase and sell loans is also significantly impacted by changes in interest rates 
increases in interest rates may also reduce the amount of loan and commitment fees received by cwb 
a significant decline in interest rates could also decrease the size of cwb s servicing portfolio and the related servicing income by increasing the level of prepayments

the deposits of the company may fluctuate up and down with local and national economic conditions 
however  management does not believe that deposit levels are significantly influenced by seasonal factors 
the company manages its money desk and obtains brokered deposits in accordance with its liquidity and strategic planning 
such deposits increased by million during as the company s general funding needs increased due to the growth in the loan portfolio 
the company can use the money desk or obtain broker deposits when necessary in a short timeframe  however  these funds are more expensive as there is substantial competition for these deposits

supervision and regulation introduction banking is a complex  highly regulated industry 
the primary goals of the regulatory scheme are to maintain a safe and sound banking system  protect depositors and the federal deposition insurance corporation s insurance fund  and facilitate the conduct of sound monetary policy 
in furtherance of these goals  congress and the states have created several largely autonomous regulatory agencies and enacted numerous laws that govern banks  bank holding companies and the financial services industry 
consequently  the growth and earnings performance of cwbc and cwb can be affected not only by management decisions and general economic conditions  but also by the requirements of applicable state and federal statues  regulations and the policies of various governmental regulatory authorities  including the board of governors of the federal reserve system  or the frb  the office of the comptroller of the currency  or the occ  and federal deposit insurance corporation  or the fdic 
the system of supervision and regulation applicable to financial services businesses governs most aspects of the business of cwbc and cwb  including i the scope of permissible business  ii investments  iii reserves that must be maintained against deposits  iv capital levels that must be maintained  v the nature and amount of collateral that may be taken to secure loans  vi the establishment of new branches  vii mergers and consolidations with other financial institutions  and viii the payment of dividends 
from time to time laws or regulations are enacted which have the effect of increasing the cost of doing business  limiting or expanding the scope of permissible activities  or changing the competitive balance between banks and other financial and non financial institutions 
proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations of banks and bank holding companies are frequently made in congress and by various bank and other regulatory agencies 
future changes in the laws  regulations or polices that impact cwbc and cwb cannot necessarily be predicted  but they may have a material effect on the business and earnings of cwbc and cwb 
cwbc general 
as a bank holding company  cwbc is registered under the bank holding company act of  as amended  or bhca  and is subject to regulation by the frb 
according to frb policy  cwbc is expected to act as a source of financial strength for cwb  to commit resources to support it in circumstances where cwbc might not otherwise do so 
under the bhca  cwbc is subject to periodic examination by the frb 
cwbc is also required to file periodic reports of its operations and any additional information regarding its activities and those of its subsidiaries as may be required by the frb 
cwbc is also a bank holding company within the meaning of section of the california financial code 
consequently  cwbc and cwb are subject to examination by  and may be required to file reports with  the commissioner of the california department of financial institutions dfi 
regulations have not yet been proposed or adopted or steps otherwise taken to implement the dfi s powers under this statute 
cwbc has a class of securities registered with the securities exchange commission sec under section of the securities exchange act of  as amended  act and has its common stock listed on the nasdaq global market 
consequently  cwbc is subject to supervision and regulation by the sec and compliance with nasdaq listing requirements 
bank holding company liquidity 
cwbc is a legal entity  separate and distinct from cwb 
cwbc has the ability to raise capital on its own behalf or borrow from external sources  cwbc may also obtain additional funds from dividends paid by  and fees charged for services provided to  cwb 
however  regulatory constraints on cwb may restrict or totally preclude the payment of dividends by cwb to cwbc 
transactions with affiliate 
cwbc and any subsidiaries it may purchase or organize are deemed to be affiliates of cwb within the meaning of sections a and b of the federal reserve act  and the frb s regulation w 
under sections a and b and regulation w  loans by cwb to affiliates  investments by them in affiliates stock  and taking affiliates stock as collateral for loans to any borrower is limited to of cwb s capital  in the case of any one affiliate  and is limited to of cwb s capital  in the case of all affiliates 
in addition  transactions between cwb and other affiliates must be on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices  in particular  a bank and its subsidiaries generally may not purchase from an affiliate a low quality asset  as defined in the federal reserve act 
these restrictions also prevent a bank holding cwbc and its other affiliates from borrowing from a banking subsidiary of the bank holding cwbc unless the loans are secured by marketable collateral of designated amounts 
cwbc and cwb are also subject to certain restrictions with respect to engaging in the underwriting  public sale and distribution of securities 
limitations on business and investment activities 
under the bhca  a bank holding company must obtain the frb s approval before i directly or indirectly acquiring more than ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank or bank holding company  ii acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank  iii or merging or consolidating with another bank holding company 
the frb may allow a bank holding company to acquire banks located in any state of the united states without regard to whether the acquisition is prohibited by the law of the state in which the target bank is located 
in approving interstate acquisitions  however  the frb must give effect to applicable state laws limiting the aggregate amount of deposits that may be held by the acquiring bank holding company and its insured depository institutions in the state in which the target bank is located  provided that those limits do not discriminate against out of state depository institutions or their holding companies  and state laws which require that the target bank have been in existence for a minimum period of time  not to exceed five years  before being acquired by an out of state bank holding company 
in addition to owning or managing banks  bank holding companies may own subsidiaries engaged in certain businesses that the frb has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto 
cwbc  therefore  is permitted to engage in a variety of banking related businesses 
some of the activities that the frb has determined  pursuant to its regulation y  to be related to banking are making or acquiring loans or other extensions of credit for its own account or for the account of others servicing loans and other extensions of credit  performing functions or activities that may be performed by a trust company in the manner authorized by federal or state law under certain circumstances  leasing personal and real property or acting as agent  broker  or adviser in leasing such property in accordance with various restrictions imposed by frb regulations  acting as investment or financial advisor  providing management consulting advise under certain circumstances  providing support services  including courier services and printing and selling micr encoded items  acting as a principal  agent or broker for insurance under certain circumstances  making equity and debt investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare or jobs for residents  providing financial  banking or economic data processing and data transmission services  owning  controlling or operating a savings association under certain circumstances  selling money orders  travelers checks and us savings bonds  providing securities brokerage services  related securities credit activities pursuant to regulation t and other incidental activities  underwriting and dealing in obligations of the us  general obligations of states and their political subdivisions and other obligations authorized for state member banks under federal law additionally  qualifying bank holding companies making an appropriate election to the frb may engage in a full range of financial activities  including insurance  securities and merchant banking 
cwbc has not elected to qualify for these financial services 
federal law prohibits a bank holding company and any subsidiary banks from engaging in certain tie in arrangements in connection with the extension of credit 
thus  for example  cwb may not extend credit  lease or sell property  or furnish any services  or fix or vary the consideration for any of the foregoing on the condition that the customer must obtain or provide some additional credit  property or services from or to cwb other than a loan  discount  deposit or trust services the customer must obtain or provide some additional credit  property or service from or to cwbc or any subsidiaries  or the customer must not obtain some other credit  property or services from competitors  except reasonable requirements to assure soundness of credit extended capital adequacy 
bank holding companies must maintain minimum levels of capital under the frb s risk based capital adequacy guidelines 
if capital falls below minimum guideline levels  a bank holding company  among other things  may be denied approval to acquire or establish additional banks or non bank businesses 
the frb s risk based capital adequacy guidelines  discussed in more detail below in the section entitled supervision and regulaton cwb regulatory capital guidelines  assign various risk percentages to different categories of assets and capital is measured as a percentage of risk assets 
under the terms of the guidelines  bank holding companies are expected to meet capital adequacy guidelines based both on total risk assets and on total assets  without regard to risk weights 
the risk based guidelines are minimum requirements 
higher capital levels will be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profiles of individual organizations 
for example  the frb s capital guidelines contemplate that additional capital may be required to take adequate account of  among other things  interest rate risk  or the risks posed by concentrations of credit  nontraditional activities or securities trading activities 
moreover  any banking organization experiencing or anticipating significant growth or expansion into new activities  particularly under the expanded powers under the gramm leach bliley act  would be expected to maintain capital ratios  including tangible capital positions  well above the minimum levels 
limitations on dividend payments 
california corporations code section allows cwbc to pay a dividend to its shareholders only to the extent that cwbc has retained earnings and  after the dividend  cwbc s assets exclusive of goodwill and other intangible assets would be times its liabilities exclusive of deferred taxes  deferred income and other deferred credits  and current assets would be at least equal to current liabilities 
additionally  the frb s policy regarding dividends provides that a bank holding cwbc should not pay cash dividends exceeding its net income or which can only be funded in ways that weaken the bank holding company s financial health  such as by borrowing 
the frb also possesses enforcement powers over bank holding companies and their non bank subsidiaries to prevent or remedy actions that represent unsafe or unsound practices or violations of applicable statutes and regulations 
the sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act of  or the sox  became effective on july   and represents the most far reaching corporate and accounting reform legislation since the enactment of the securities act of and the exchange act of the sox is intended to provide a permanent framework that improves the quality of independent audits and accounting services  improves the quality of financial reporting  strengthens the independence of accounting firms and increases the responsibility of management for corporate disclosures and financial statements 
it is intended that by addressing these weaknesses  public companies will be able to avoid the problems encountered by several companies in the sox s provisions are significant to all companies that have a class of securities registered under section of the exchange act  or are otherwise reporting to the sec or the appropriate federal banking agency pursuant to section d of the exchange act  including cwbc collectively  public companies 
in addition to sec rulemaking to implement the sox  the nasdaq global market has adopted corporate governance rules intended to allow shareholders to more easily and effectively monitor the performance of companies and directors 
the principal provisions of the sox  many of which have been interpreted through regulations released in  provide for and include  among other things the creation of an independent accounting oversight board  auditor independence provisions that restrict non audit services that accountants may provide to their audit clients  additional corporate governance and responsibility measures  including the requirement that the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of a public company certify financial statements  the forfeiture of bonuses or other incentive based compensation and profits from the sale of an issuer s securities by directors and senior officers in the twelve month period following initial publication of any financial statements that later require restatement  an increase in the oversight of  and enhancement of certain requirements relating to  audit committees of public companies and how they interact with cwbc s independent auditors  requirements that audit committee members must be independent and are barred from accepting consulting  advisory or other compensatory fees from the issuer  requirements that companies disclose whether at least one member of the audit committee is a financial expert as such term is defined by the sec and if not discussed  why the audit committee does not have a financial expert  expanded disclosure requirements for corporate insiders  including accelerated reporting of stock transactions by insiders and a prohibition on insider trading during pension blackout periods  a prohibition on personal loans to directors and officers  except certain loans made by insured financial institutions on non preferential terms and in compliance with other bank regulatory requirements  disclosure of a code of ethics and filing a form k for a change or waiver of such code  a range of enhanced penalties for fraud and other violations  and expanded disclosure and certification relating to an issuer s disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting 
as a result of the sox  and its implementing regulations  cwbc has incurred substantial cost to interpret and ensure compliance with the law and its regulations including  without limitation  increased expenditures by cwbc in auditors fees  attorneys fees  outside advisors fees  and increased errors and omissions insurance premium costs 
effective september  the sec extended the compliance dates for non accelerated filers such as cwbc with the internal control over financial reporting requirements to july  cwbc cannot be certain of the effect  if any  of the foregoing legislation on the business of cwbc although increased costs of compliance are likely 
future changes in the laws  regulation  or policies that impact cwbc cannot necessarily be predicted and may have a material effect on the business and earnings of cwbc 
cwb general 
cwb  as a national banking association which is a member of the federal reserve system  is subject to regulation  supervision and regular examination by the occ  fdic and the frb 
cwb s deposits are insured by the fdic up to the maximum extent provided by law 
the regulations of these agencies govern most aspects of cwb s business and establish a comprehensive framework governing its operations 
regulatory capital guidelines 
the federal banking agencies have established minimum capital standards known as risk based capital guidelines 
these guidelines are intended to provide a measure of capital that reflects the degree of risk associated with a bank s operations 
the risk based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating the amount of capital that must be maintained against a bank s assets and off balance sheet items 
the amount of capital required to be maintained is based upon the credit risks associated with the various types of a bank s assets and off balance sheet items 
a bank s assets and off balance sheet items are classified under several risk categories  with each category assigned a particular risk weighting from to 
caption adequately well cwbc capitalized capitalized cwb consolidated greater than or equal to 
del total risk based capital tier risk based capital ratio tier leverage capital ratio del 
as of december   management believes that cwbc s capital levels met all minimum regulatory requirements and that cwb was considered well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
prompt corrective action 
the federal banking agencies possess broad powers to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured banks 
each federal banking agency has issued regulations defining five capital categories well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
under the regulations  a bank shall be deemed to be well capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or more  has a tier risk based capital ratio of or more  has a leverage capital ratio of or more and is not subject to specified requirements to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure  adequately capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or more  a tier risk based capital ratio of or more and a leverage capital ratio of or more under certain circumstances and does not meet the definition of well capitalized  undercapitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio that is less than  a tier risk based capital ratio that is less than  or a leverage capital ratio that is less than under certain circumstances significantly undercapitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio that is less than  a tier risk based capital ratio that is less than or a leverage capital ratio that is less than  and critically undercapitalized if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than banks are prohibited from paying dividends or management fees to controlling persons or entities if  after making the payment  the bank would be undercapitalized  that is  the bank fails to meet the required minimum level for any relevant capital measure 
asset growth and branching restrictions apply to undercapitalized banks 
banks classified as undercapitalized are required to submit acceptable capital plans guaranteed by its holding company  if any 
broad regulatory authority was granted with respect to significantly undercapitalized banks  including forced mergers  growth restrictions  ordering new elections for directors  forcing divestiture by its holding company  if any  requiring management changes and prohibiting the payment of bonuses to senior management 
even more severe restrictions are applicable to critically undercapitalized banks  those with capital at or less than 
restrictions for these banks include the appointment of a receiver or conservator 
all of the federal banking agencies have promulgated substantially similar regulations to implement this system of prompt corrective action a bank  based upon its capital levels  that is classified as well capitalized  adequately capitalized or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency  after notice and opportunity for a hearing  determines that an unsafe or unsound condition  or an unsafe or unsound practice  warrants such treatment 
at each successive lower capital category  an insured bank is subject to more restrictions 
the federal banking agencies  however  may not treat an institution as critically undercapitalized unless its capital ratios actually warrant such treatment 
in addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions  insured banks may be subject to potential enforcement actions by the federal banking agencies for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses or for violations of any law  rule  regulation or any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency 
enforcement actions may include the imposition of a conservator or receiver  the issuance of a cease and desist order that can be judicially enforced  the termination of insurance of deposits in the case of a depository institution  the imposition of civil money penalties  the issuance of directives to increase capital  the issuance of formal and informal agreements  the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against institution affiliated parties 
the enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders may be based upon a judicial determination that the agency would be harmed if such equitable relief was not granted 
the occ  as the primary regulator for national banks  also has a broad range of enforcement measures  from cease and desist powers and the imposition of monetary penalties to the ability to take possession of a bank  including causing its liquidation 
fdic insurance and insurance assessments 
banks and thrifts have historically paid varying amounts of premiums for federal deposit insurance depending upon a risk based system which evaluated the institution s regulatory and capital adequacy ratings 
the fdic operated two separate insurance funds  the bank insurance fund bif and the savings association insurance fund saif 
as a result of the federal deposit insurance reform act of the fdi reform act and regulations adopted by the fdic effective as of november  i the bif and the saif have been merged into the deposit insurance fund the dif  ii the  insurance level has been indexed to reflect inflation the first adjustment for inflation will be effective january  and thereafter adjustments will occur every years  iii deposit insurance coverage for retirement accounts has been increased to  and will also be subject to adjustment every five years  iv banks that historically have capitalized the bif are entitled to a one time credit which can be used to off set premiums otherwise due this addresses the fact that institutions that have grown rapidly have not had to pay deposit premiums  v a cap on the level of the dif has been imposed and dividends will be paid when the dif grows beyond a specified threshold  and vi the previous risk based system for assessing premiums has been revised 
prior to january   the fdic utilized a risk based assessment system to set semi annual insurance premium assessments which categorized banks into risk categories based on two criteria  three capital levels and three supervisory ratings  creating a nine cell matrix for risk based assessments 
the new assessment system consolidates the previous nine risk categories into four and names them risk categories i  ii  iii and iv 
the four new categories will continue to be defined based upon supervisory and capital evaluations 
in practice  the subgroup evaluations will generally be based on an institution s composite camels rating assigned to it by the institution s federal supervisor at the end of its examination 
the camels rating system is based upon an evaluation of the five critical elements of an institution s operations capital adequacy  asset quality  management  earnings  liquidity  and sensitivity to risk 
this rating system is designed to take into account and reflect all significant financial and operational factors financial institution examiners assess in their evaluation of an institution s performance 
the consolidation creates four new risk categories as shown in following table caption supervisory subgroup 
del capital group a b c well capitalized i iii adequately capitalized ii undercapitalized iii iv del 
within risk category i  the new assessment system combines supervisory ratings with other risk measures to differentiate risk 
for most institutions  the new assessment system combines camels component ratings with financial ratios to determine an institution s assessment rate 
for large institutions that have long term debt issuer ratings  the new assessment system differentiates risk by combining camels component ratings with those ratings 
for large institutions within risk category i  initial assessment rate determinations may be modified within limits upon review of additional relevant information 
the new assessment system assess those within risk category i that pose the least risk a minimum assessment rate and those that pose the greatest risk a maximum assessment rate that is two basis points higher 
an institution that poses an intermediate risk within risk category i will be charged a rate between the minimum and maximum that will vary incrementally by institution 
effective january   the actual assessment rates under this new assessment system are summarized below  expressed in terms of cents per in insured deposits caption risk category i ii iii iv minimum maximum 
del del 
rates for institutions that do no pay the minimum or maximum rate vary between these rates 
the fdic may terminate its insurance of deposits if it finds that the bank has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations  or has violated any applicable law  regulation  rule  order or condition imposed by the fdic 
community reinvestment act 
the cra is intended to encourage insured depository institutions  while operating safely and soundly  to help meet the credit needs of their communities 
the cra specifically directs the federal bank regulatory agencies  in examining insured depository institutions  to assess their record of helping to meet the credit needs of their entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods  consistent with safe and sound banking practices 
the cra further requires the agencies to take a financial institution s record of meeting its community credit needs into account when evaluating applications for  among other things  domestic branches  consummating mergers or acquisitions or holding company formations 
the federal banking agencies have adopted regulations which measure a bank s compliance with its cra obligations on a performance based evaluation system 
this system bases cra ratings on an institution s actual lending service and investment performance rather than the extent to which the institution conducts needs assessments  documents community outreach or complies with other procedural requirements 
the ratings range from outstanding to a low of substantial noncompliance 
cwb had a cra rating of satisfactory as of its most recent regulatory examination 
environmental regulation 
federal  state and local laws and regulations regarding the discharge of harmful materials into the environment may have an impact on cwb 
since cwb is not involved in any business that manufactures  uses or transports chemicals  waste  pollutants or toxins that might have a material adverse effect on the environment  cwb s primary exposure to environmental laws is through its lending activities and through properties or businesses cwb may own  lease or acquire 
based on a general survey of cwb s loan portfolio  conversations with local appraisers and the type of lending currently and historically done by cwb  management is not aware of any potential liability for hazardous waste contamination that would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on cwbc as of december  safeguarding of customer information and privacy 
the frb and other bank regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines for safeguarding confidential  personal customer information 
these guidelines require financial institutions to create  implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information  protect against any anticipated threats or hazard to the security or integrity of such information and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer 
cwb has adopted a customer information security program to comply with such requirements 
financial institutions are also required to implement policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of nonpublic personal information about consumers to non affiliated third parties 
in general  financial institutions must provide explanations to consumers on policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of such nonpublic personal information  and  except as otherwise required by law  prohibits disclosing such information except as provided in cwb s policies and procedures 
cwb has implemented privacy policies addressing these restrictions which are distributed regularly to all existing and new customers of cwb 
usa patriot act 
on october   the president signed into law comprehensive anti terrorism legislation  the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of  known as the patriot act 
the usa patriot act patriot act was designed to deny terrorists and others the ability to obtain access to the united states financial system  and has significant implications for financial institutions and other businesses involved in the transfer of money 
the patriot act  as implemented by various federal regulatory agencies  requires financial institutions  including cwb  to implement new policies and procedures or amend existing policies and procedures with respect to  among other matters  anti money laundering  compliance  suspicious activity and currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers 
the patriot act and its underlying regulations also permit information sharing for counter terrorist purposes between federal law enforcement agencies and financial institutions  as well as among financial institutions  subject to certain conditions  and require the frb  the occ and other federal banking agencies to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering activities when considering applications filed under section of the bhca or the bank merger act 
cwb has augmented its systems and procedures to accomplish this
