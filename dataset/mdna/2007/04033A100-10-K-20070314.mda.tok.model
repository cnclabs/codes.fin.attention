item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are engaged in the discovery and development of breakthrough medicines to treat cancers by regulating cell signaling with small molecules 
we are developing a comprehensive approach to patients with cancer that addresses the greatest medical need aggressive and advanced stage cancers for which current treatments are inadequate 
our goal is to build a fully integrated oncology company focused on novel  molecularly targeted therapies to treat solid tumors and hematologic cancers  as well as the spread of primary tumors to distant sites 
our lead cancer product candidate  ap  has been or is being studied in multiple clinical trials in patients with various types of cancers  including sarcomas  hormone refractory prostate cancer  endometrial cancer  brain cancer and leukemias and lymphomas 
we expect to commence enrollment in our initial phase clinical trial of ap in patients with advanced bone and soft tissue sarcomas in we discovered ap in a research and development program conducted by us on behalf of ariad gene therapeutics  inc  or agti  our owned subsidiary 
in  we entered into a partnership with medinol ltd  a leading cardiovascular medical device company  to develop and commercialize stents and other medical devices to deliver ap in order to prevent reblockage of injured vessels following stent assisted angioplasty  a common non surgical procedure for dilating or opening narrowed arteries 
our second product candidate  ap  is in preclinical testing for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia 
we expect to file an investigational new drug application  or ind  for this product candidate with the fda in the second half of in addition to our lead development programs  we have a focused drug discovery program centered on small molecule  molecularly targeted therapies and cell signaling pathways implicated in cancer 
we also have an exclusive license to a family of patents  three in the us and one in europe  including a pioneering us patent covering methods of treating human disease by regulating nf b cell signaling activity 
additionally  we have developed a proprietary portfolio of cell signaling regulation technologies  our argent technology  to control intracellular processes with small molecules  which may be useful in the development of therapeutic vaccines and gene and cell therapy products and which provide versatile tools for applications in cell biology  functional genomics and drug discovery research 
since our inception in  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to our research and development programs  including those we conduct on behalf of agti 
we receive no revenue from the sale of pharmaceutical products  and most of our revenue to date was received in connection with a joint venture we had with a major pharmaceutical company from to except for the gain on the sale of our fifty percent interest in that joint venture in december  which resulted in net income for fiscal  we have not been profitable since inception 
we expect to incur substantial and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future  primarily due to costs associated with our pharmaceutical product development programs  including costs for clinical trials and product manufacturing  personnel and our intellectual property 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that these fluctuations may be substantial 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million and working capital of million 
in february  we obtained a commitment for up to million in equity financing from azimuth opportunity ltd 
which is available for us to access  subject to certain terms and conditions  over the month term of the agreement 
general our operating losses are primarily due to the costs associated with our pharmaceutical product development programs  personnel and intellectual property protection and enforcement 
as our product development programs progress  we incur significant costs for toxicology and pharmacology studies  product development  manufacturing  clinical trials and regulatory support 
these costs can vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the number of product candidates in development  the stage of development of each product candidate  the number of patients enrolled in and complexity of clinical trials and other factors 
costs associated with our intellectual property include legal fees and other costs to prosecute  maintain  protect and enforce our intellectual property  which can fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on the status of patent issues being pursued 
because we currently receive no revenue from the sale of pharmaceutical products and receive only limited license revenue  we have relied primarily on the capital markets as our source of funding 
in august and october  we raised approximately million and million  respectively  through underwritten public offerings of our common stock 
we also have million available under an equity financing facility 
we utilize long term debt to supplement our funding  particularly as a means to fund investment in property and equipment and infrastructure needs 
in addition  we plan to seek funding from collaborations with pharmaceutical  biotechnology and or medical device companies for development and commercialization of our product candidates and are currently in negotiations with several companies for a partnership to develop and commercialize ap in a broad range of oncology indications 
these collaborations may take the form of licensing arrangements  co development or joint venture arrangements or other structures 
if funding from these various sources is unavailable on reasonable terms  we may be required to reduce our operating expenses in order to conserve cash and capital by delaying  scaling back or eliminating one or more of our product development programs 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial position and results of operations are affected by subjective and complex judgments  particularly in the areas of the carrying value of intangible assets  deferred compensation benefits for executives  and stock based compensation 
at december   we reported million of intangible assets consisting of capitalized costs related primarily to purchased and issued patents  patent applications and licenses  net of accumulated amortization 
these costs are being amortized over the estimated useful lives of the underlying patents or licenses 
changes in the estimated useful lives or a decision to discontinue using the technologies could result in material changes to our balance sheet and statements of operations 
for example  during and  we expensed  and  respectively  of unamortized costs related to certain intangible assets which we are not actively pursuing any longer 
we have concluded that the carrying value of our remaining intangible assets is not currently impaired because such carrying value does not exceed the future net cash flows expected to be generated by such intangible assets 
if we were to abandon the underlying technologies or terminate our efforts to pursue collaborations or license agreements  we may be required to write off all or a portion of the carrying value of our intangible assets 
the net book value as of december  of intangible assets related to our nf b technology is  if the patentability of our nf b patents is successfully challenged and such patents are subsequently narrowed  invalidated or circumvented  we may be required to write off some or all of the net book value related to such technology 
under our deferred executive compensation plans  we are required to adjust our recorded obligations to our employees on a periodic basis to reflect fair value based on the quoted market value of certain underlying mutual funds 
fluctuations in the quoted market value of such mutual funds can result in uneven expense charges or credits to our statements of operations 
if  for example  the quoted market prices of the underlying mutual funds were higher at december   we would have recognized an additional  in compensation expense in in determining expense related to stock based compensation  we utilize the black scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees  consultants and directors 
application of the black scholes option valuation model requires the use of factors such as the market value and volatility of our common stock  a risk free discount rate  and an estimate of the life of the option contract 
fluctuations in these factors can result in adjustments to our statements of operations 
if  for example  the market value of our common stock  its volatility or expected life of stock options granted during the three month period ended december   were higher or lower than used in the valuation of such stock options  our stock based compensation expense for the awards would have increased or decreased by up to   or  respectively 
results of operations years ended december  and revenue we recognized license revenue of  for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in license revenue was due primarily to the impact of the expected timing of receipt of future milestone payments pursuant to our agreement with medinol  ltd 
in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
operating expenses research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased by million  or  to million in  compared to million in the research and development process necessary to develop a pharmaceutical product for commercialization is subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
this process typically takes years to complete and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
current requirements include preclinical toxicology  pharmacology and metabolism studies  as well as in vivo efficacy studies in relevant animal models of disease  manufacturing of drug product for preclinical studies and clinical trials and ultimately for commercial supply  submission of the results of preclinical studies and information regarding manufacturing and control and proposed clinical protocol to the fda in an investigational new drug application  or ind or similar filings with regulatory agencies outside the united states  conduct of clinical trials designed to provide data and information regarding the safety and efficacy of the product candidate in humans  and submission of all the results of testing to the fda in a new drug application  or nda or similar filings with regulatory agencies outside the united states 
upon approval by the appropriate regulatory authorities  including in some countries approval of product pricing  we may commence commercial marketing and distribution of the product 
we group our research and development  or r d  expenses into two major categories direct external expenses and all other r d expenses 
direct external expenses consist of costs of outside parties to conduct laboratory studies  to develop manufacturing processes and manufacture product candidates  to conduct and manage clinical trials and similar costs related to our clinical and preclinical studies 
these costs are accumulated and tracked by product candidate 
all other r d expenses consist of costs to compensate personnel  to purchase lab supplies and services  to lease  operate and maintain our facility  equipment and overhead and similar costs of our research and development efforts 
these costs apply to work on our clinical and preclinical candidates as well as our discovery research efforts 
these costs are not tracked by product candidate because the number of product candidates and projects in r d may vary from time to time and because we utilize internal resources across multiple projects at the same time 
direct external expenses are further categorized as costs for clinical programs and costs for preclinical programs 
preclinical programs include product candidates undergoing toxicology  pharmacology  metabolism and efficacy studies and manufacturing process development required before testing in humans can begin 
product candidates are designated as clinical programs once we have filed an ind with the fda  or a similar filing with regulatory agencies outside the united states  for the purpose of commencing clinical trials in humans 
our r d expenses for as compared to were as follows year ended december  increase in thousands decrease direct external expenses clinical programs preclinical programs all other r d expenses ap  our lead product candidate which is in phase clinical trials  was our only clinical program in and direct external expenses for ap decreased by million in as compared to due primarily to decreases in clinical trial costs million and manufacturing related costs million 
the decrease in clinical trial costs is directly related to the decrease in the number of patients on trial during the period driven by successful conclusion in and of enrollment in several clinical trials 
manufacturing costs include product and process development work  as well as the costs to produce drug product 
manufacturing costs for ap decreased in as compared to due to the completion in of certain product and process development studies and the timing of production runs of ap through december   we have incurred a total of approximately million in direct external expenses for ap from the date it became a clinical program 
we expect that our direct external costs for ap will increase in from as we commence enrollment of patients in a phase clinical trial for this product candidate 
our preclinical programs are focused on the development of additional novel  small molecule  molecularly targeted therapies including kinase inhibitors targeting cancer related processes such as cell survival  metastasis and angiogenesis 
our kinase inhibitor program includes our second product candidate  ap direct external expenses on preclinical programs will increase or decrease over time depending on the status and number of programs in this stage of development and the mix between external and internal efforts applied to such programs 
direct external expenses for preclinical programs decreased by  in as compared to due primarily to the completion of certain pharmacology studies conducted by outside contract laboratories in we expect that our direct external expenses for preclinical programs will increase in  as resources allow  as we conduct the necessary testing to support the filing of an ind for ap and continue to move these programs forward in development 
all other r d expenses increased by million in as compared to due to higher personnel and related costs as a result of an increase in the number of personnel and salary adjustments million and the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
r  share based payment  regarding stock based compensation expense million  an increase in depreciation and amortization costs related to our property and equipment million and miscellaneous increases in costs related to our facility  including maintenance and utility costs 
we expect that all other r d expenses will increase in in support of the expanding activity in our clinical and preclinical programs  including the commencement of enrollment in a phase clinical trial for our lead product candidate  ap the successful development of our product candidates is uncertain and subject to a number of risks 
we cannot be certain that any of our product candidates will prove to be safe and effective or will meet all of the applicable regulatory requirements needed to receive and maintain marketing approval 
data from preclinical studies and clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory clearance 
we  the fda or other regulatory authorities may suspend clinical trials at any time if we or they believe that the subjects participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable risks or if such regulatory agencies find deficiencies in the conduct of the trials or other problems with our products under development 
delays or rejections may be encountered based on additional governmental regulation  legislation  administrative action or changes in fda or other regulatory policy during development or the review process 
other risks associated with our product development programs are described in part i  item a risk factors 
due to these uncertainties  accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate cost to bring a product to market  the timing of completion of any of our drug development programs and the period in which material net cash inflows from any of our drug development programs will commence are unavailable 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  from million in to million in professional fees increased by million to million in as compared to million in due primarily to costs related to expansion of business and commercial development initiatives and to our patent infringement litigation with lilly and amgen 
personnel and related costs increased by million due to an increase in the number of personnel and salary adjustments  and the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r million 
we expect that our professional fees will decrease significantly in reflecting the completion of the lilly trial in we expect that all other general and administrative expenses will increase slightly in as necessary to support our research and development programs 
we expect that our operating expenses in total will increase in for the reasons described above 
operating expenses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
the actual amount of any increase in operating expenses will depend on the progress of our product development programs  including preclinical and clinical studies and product manufacturing  the impact of a potential collaboration with a pharmaceutical company for the development and commercialization of ap  developments in our patent infringement litigation and our ability to raise funding through equity offerings  the use of our million equity financing facility  collaborations  licensing  joint ventures or other sources 
interest income expense interest income increased by to million in from million in  as a result of higher interest yields from our cash equivalents and marketable securities  offset in part by a lower average balance of funds invested in interest expense increased by to  in from  in  as a result of higher interest rates offset in part by lower average loan balances in operating results we reported a loss from operations of million in compared to a loss from operations of million in  an increase in loss of million  or 
such increase was due primarily to the increase in operating expenses noted above 
we expect that our loss from operations in will remain at approximately the same level as in as a result of the net effect of the above noted expected increase in r d expenses offset by an expected decrease in litigation cost and an expected increase in revenue from existing license agreements 
losses may fluctuate depending on the extent to which  if at all  we enter into collaborations or partnerships for one or more of our product candidates or licenses for our technologies 
the extent of operating losses will also depend on our ability to raise funds from other sources  such as the capital markets  or utilize our million equity financing facility  which will influence the amount we will spend on research and development and the development timelines for our product candidates 
we reported a net loss of million in compared to a net loss of million in  an increase in net loss of million or  and a net loss per share of in both and due to a greater weighted average number of shares of our common stock outstanding in from years ended december  and revenue we recognized license revenue of million for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in license revenue was due primarily to a license agreement we signed in january with medinol to develop and commercialize stents and other medical devices to deliver our lead product candidate  ap  to prevent reblockage of injured vessels following stent assisted angioplasty 
operating expenses research and development expenses research and development expenses increased by million  or  from million in to million in our r d expenses for as compared to were as follows year ended december  increase in thousands decrease direct external expenses clinical programs preclinical programs all other r d expenses direct external expenses for ap  our only clinical program in and  increased by million in as compared to due primarily to increases in clinical trial costs million and manufacturing related costs million 
in  we continued to enroll patients in our existing clinical trials of ap and initiated new clinical trials in additional disease indications  including prostate and endometrial cancer 
the increase in clinical trial costs is directly related to the increased enrollment  the costs of evaluating enrolled patients  the costs of managing the trials  laboratory costs and the costs of compiling and analyzing results obtained in the trials 
manufacturing costs include product and process development work  as well as the costs to produce drug product 
manufacturing costs for ap increased in as compared to due to an increase in the quantities of drug product manufactured for the clinical trials and investments in manufacturing process development 
direct external expenses for preclinical programs decreased by million in as compared to due primarily to the completion of certain pharmacology and toxicology studies conducted by outside contract laboratories in  as well as expansion of internal efforts on these programs in all other r d expenses increased by million in as compared to due to higher personnel and related costs million as a result of an increase in the number of personnel and salary adjustments  an increase in depreciation and amortization costs related to our property and equipment million due to the impact of capital improvements and purchases in and  an increase in laboratory supplies and services  related to ongoing development of our clinical and preclinical programs and miscellaneous increases in costs related to our facility  including maintenance and utility costs 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  from million in to million in professional fees increased by million to million in as compared to million in due primarily to costs related to expansion of business and commercial development initiatives and to our patent infringement litigation with lilly 
this increase was offset in part by a decrease in expenses related to a restricted stock grant to our chief executive officer in january which was fully amortized by december  interest income expense interest income increased by to million in from million in  as a result of higher interest yields from our cash equivalents and marketable securities  offset in part by a lower average balance of funds invested in interest expense increased by to  in from  in  as a result of higher interest rates and higher average loan balances in operating results we reported a loss from operations of million in compared to a loss from operations of million in  an increase in loss of million  or 
we reported a net loss of million in compared to a net loss of million in  an increase in net loss of million or  and a net loss per share of and in and  respectively 
selected quarterly financial data summarized unaudited quarterly financial data are as follows in thousands  except per share amounts first second third fourth total license revenue net loss net loss per share in thousands  except per share amounts first second third fourth total license revenue net loss net loss per share liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations and investments primarily through sales of our common stock to institutional investors and  to a lesser extent  through issuances of our common stock pursuant to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans  supplemented by the issuance of long term debt 
we sell securities and incur debt when the terms of such transactions are deemed favorable to us and as necessary to fund our current and projected cash needs 
we seek to balance the level of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand with our projected needs and to allow us to withstand periods of uncertainty relative to the availability of funding on favorable terms 
sources of funds during the years ended december   and  our sources of funds were as follows in thousands maturities of marketable securities  net of purchases sales issuances of common stock in common stock offerings pursuant to stock option and employee stock purchase plans proceeds from long term borrowings we manage our marketable securities portfolio to provide cash for payment of our obligations 
we purchase marketable securities to enhance our yield on invested funds and when such amounts are not needed for near term payment of obligations 
we generally hold our marketable securities to maturity 
upon maturity of such marketable securities  a portion may be retained as cash to provide for payment of current obligations while the remainder will be reinvested in accordance with our investment policy 
for the years ended december   and  proceeds from maturities of marketable securities  purchases of marketable securities and the resulting net amount retained as cash for payment of obligations or reinvested was as follows in thousands proceeds from maturities of marketable securities purchases of marketable securities the amount of funding we raise through sales of our common stock depends on many factors  including  but not limited to  the status and progress of our product development programs  projected cash needs  availability of funding from other sources  our stock price and the status of the capital markets 
in  and  we completed underwritten offerings of our common stock for net proceeds of million  million and million  respectively 
the following table details our common stock offerings in  and number of shares price per share net cash proceeds in thousands march  august  october  we have filed shelf registration statements with the sec  from time to time  to register shares of our common stock that are available for sale  giving us the opportunity to raise funding when considered appropriate 
on december   we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec for the issuance of up to  shares of our common stock  which was declared effective on january  on february   we filed another shelf registration statement with the sec which was amended on march  for the issuance of up to  shares of our common stock 
this filing was declared effective on march  as of december   after selling shares in each of the offerings mentioned above  we have used all of the shares available for issuance under our then effective shelf registrations 
on january   we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec for the issuance of common stock  preferred stock  various series of debt securities and or warrants to purchase any of such securities  either individually or in units  with a total value of up to million  from time to time at prices and on terms to be determined at the time of any such offerings 
this filing was declared effective on february  no securities have yet been issued under this registration statement 
on february   we entered into an agreement with azimuth opportunity ltd 
under which we may offer and sell  and azimuth is committed to purchase  subject to the terms set forth in the agreement  the lesser of up to million of our common stock  or the number of shares which is one less than twenty percent of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock as of the effective date of the agreement 
these shares will be registered under the shelf registration statement we filed on january  at our sole discretion  we may initiate up to draw downs during the approximately month term of the agreement by delivering notice to azimuth 
each draw down notice will specify a the aggregate dollar amount of our common stock to be sold to azimuth during such draw down and b the minimum threshold price at which we will sell such shares  which will not be less than per share 
azimuth will be required to purchase a pro rata portion of the shares for each trading day during a price period of consecutive trading days on which the daily volume weighted average price for our common stock exceeds the minimum threshold price 
the per share purchase price for these shares will equal the daily volume weighted average price of our common stock on such date  less a discount ranging from to  depending on the minimum threshold price 
in connection with any such draw down at our sole discretion  we may also grant azimuth the right  during the relevant draw down pricing period  to purchase additional shares of our common stock by specifying in the draw down notice an optional aggregate dollar amount and a minimum threshold price for such optional shares 
azimuth is not obligated to purchase the optional amount 
the per share purchase price for these optional shares will equal the greater of the daily volume weighted average price of our common stock on the day azimuth notifies us of its election to exercise such right or the minimum threshold price for such optional shares  less a discount ranging from to 
upon each sale of common stock to azimuth  we will pay to reedland capital partners  an institutional division of financial west group  a placement fee equal to of the aggregate dollar amount received by us from such sale 
in march  we entered into a term loan agreement with a bank for million  the proceeds of which were used to repay existing long term debt  to pay off our obligations under certain operating leases for equipment and for general working capital purposes 
the loan is secured by all of our assets excluding intellectual property  which we have agreed not to pledge to any other party without the consent of the bank 
the loan carries interest at the bank s prime rate or libor plus 
we amended the terms of the loan on december  and december   receiving another million and million  respectively  in loan proceeds 
the amended loan is payable in monthly installments of  plus interest beginning in january with a final payment of million due in march the terms of the loan require us to maintain at least million in unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and investments 
the agreement also contains certain covenants that restrict additional indebtedness  additional liens  and sales of assets  and dividends  distributions or repurchases of common stock 
the balance outstanding as of december  was  uses of funds the primary uses of our cash are to fund our operations and working capital requirements and  to a lesser degree  to repay our long term debt  to invest in intellectual property and to invest in our property and equipment as needed for our business 
our uses of cash during the years ended december   and were as follows in thousands net cash used in operating activities repayment of long term borrowings investment in intangible assets investment in property and equipment the net cash used in operating activities is comprised of our net losses  adjusted for non cash expenses and working capital requirements 
as noted above  our net loss increased in and due primarily to the increased costs of advancing our product candidates through preclinical and clinical phases of development  expansion of business and commercial development initiatives and patent litigation 
also as noted above  we expect that our net loss in will remain at approximately the same level as in however  we expect that our net cash used in operating activities will decrease in due to the impact of cash to be received from existing license agreements that will be deferred as revenue to future years and increases in depreciation and amortization and changes in working capital 
we expect that our investment in intangible assets  consisting of our intellectual property  will increase in in support of our product development activities 
our investment in property and equipment increased in primarily due to a renovation project to create more useable space in our facility and an upgrade to our information technology infrastructure  and decreased in due to substantive completion of such projects in we expect that our investment in property and equipment will increase in as we continue to advance our research and development activities 
contractual obligations we have substantial fixed contractual obligations under various research and licensing agreements  consulting and employment agreements  lease agreements and long term debt instruments 
these contractual obligations were comprised of the following as of december in thousands payments due by period total in through through after long term debt operating leases employment agreements    other long term obligations long term debt consists of scheduled principal payments on such debt 
interest on our long term debt is based on variable interest rates 
assuming a constant interest rate of  our average interest rate on our debt at december   over the remaining term of the debt  our interest expense would total approximately  in and  in other long term obligations are comprised primarily of obligations under our deferred executive compensation plans and license agreements 
the license agreements generally provide for payment by us of annual license fees  milestone payments and royalties upon successful commercialization of products 
all license agreements are cancelable by us 
the above table reflects remaining license fees for the lives of the agreements but excludes milestone and royalty payments  as such amounts are not probable or estimable at this time 
liquidity at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million and working capital of million  compared to cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million and working capital of million at december  we will require substantial additional funding for our research and development programs  including preclinical development and clinical trials  for operating expenses including intellectual property protection and enforcement  for the pursuit of regulatory approvals  and for establishing manufacturing  marketing and sales capabilities 
in order to fund our needs  we may sell securities of the company through public or private offerings as market conditions permit or to azimuth under the million equity financing commitment  enter into partnerships for our product candidates  and or license our cell signaling technologies  including our argent and nf b intellectual property 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at december  should be sufficient to satisfy our capital and operating requirements approximately through the third quarter of if we fully utilize our million equity financing facility  we could extend the sufficiency of our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities to at least mid however  there are numerous factors that are likely to affect our spending levels  including the timing of the start of  and the rate of patient enrollment in  our initial phase clinical trial for ap  the timing of product and process development work for ap  the manufacture of drug product for clinical trials and potential product launch  if approved  developments in our ongoing clinical trials  the timing and terms of a partnership  if any  to develop and commercialize ap  the status of our in house efforts to prepare for the potential launch of ap  the progress of our preclinical programs  the potential acquisition of or other strategic transaction regarding the minority stockholders interests in agti  and developments in our nf kb litigation  among other factors 
these variables could result in earlier or later depletion of our current funds if we are to continue operations in accordance with our current plans and achieve our intended timelines for development 
in any event  we expect to need additional funding in order to pursue our business plan  which we will seek to raise through the sale of additional securities  including the possible sale of common stock to azimuth under the million equity financing commitment  collaborative partnerships  and possible additional credit arrangements 
there can be no assurance  however  that adequate resources will be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainties in income taxes  which defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authorities 
fin also requires explicit disclosure requirements about a company s uncertainties related to their income tax position  including a detailed roll forward of tax benefits taken that do not quality for financial statement recognition 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we expect that the adoption of fin will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  and is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are assessing the impact of sfas no 
on our financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our available funds in accordance with our investment policy to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
we invest cash balances in excess of operating requirements first in short term  highly liquid securities  with original maturities of days or less  and money market accounts 
depending on our level of available funds and our expected cash requirements  we may invest a portion of our funds in marketable securities  consisting generally of corporate debt and us government and agency securities 
maturities of our marketable securities are generally limited to periods necessary to fund our liquidity needs and may not in any case exceed three years 
these securities are classified as available for sale 
available for sale securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
realized gains and losses on marketable security transactions  if any  are reported on the specific identification method 
interest income is recognized when earned 
a decline in the market value of any available for sale security below cost that is deemed other than temporary results in a charge to earnings and establishes a new cost basis for the security 
our investments are sensitive to interest rate risk 
we believe  however  that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows generally would not be material due to the current short term nature of these investments 
in particular  at december   because our available funds were invested solely in cash equivalents and short term marketable securities with maturities of months or less  our risk of loss due to changes in interest rates is not material 
we have an executive compensation plan which provides participants with deferred compensation based on the value of certain designated mutual funds 
the fair value of our obligations under this program is reflected as a liability on our balance sheet 
in the event of a hypothetical increase in the fair market value of the underlying mutual funds as of december   we would have incurred approximately  of additional compensation expense 
at december   we had million outstanding under a bank term note which bears interest at prime or  alternatively  libor 
this note is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
in the event of a hypothetical increase in the interest rate on which the loan is based basis points at december   we would incur approximately  of additional interest expense in certain factors that may affect future results of operations the sec encourages companies to disclose forward looking information so that investors can better understand a company s future prospects and make informed investment decisions
