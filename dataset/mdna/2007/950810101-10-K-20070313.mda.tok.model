table of contents market risk the primary objective of wesbanco s alco is to maximize net interest income within established policy parameters 
this objective is accomplished through the management of balance sheet composition  market risk exposures arising from changing economic conditions and liquidity risk 
market risk is defined as the risk of loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments resulting from fluctuations in interest rates and equity prices 
management considers interest rate risk wesbanco s most significant market risk 
interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in net interest income due to changes in interest rates 
consistency of wesbanco s net interest income is largely dependent on effective management of interest rate risk 
as interest rates change in the market  rates earned on interest rate sensitive assets and rates paid on interest rate sensitive liabilities do not necessarily move concurrently 
differing rate sensitivities may arise because fixed rate assets and liabilities may not have the same maturities or because variable rate assets and liabilities differ in the timing and or the percentage of rate changes 
wesbanco s alco  comprised of senior management  monitors and manages interest rate risk within board approved policy limits 
interest rate risk is monitored primarily through the use of an earnings simulation model 
the model is highly dependent on assumptions  which change regularly as the balance sheet and interest rates change 
the key assumptions and strategies employed are analyzed quarterly and reviewed by alco 
the earnings simulation model projects changes in net interest income resulting from the effect of changes in interest rates 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the earnings simulation model 
modeling changes in net interest income requires making certain assumptions regarding prepayment rates  callable bonds  and adjustments to non time deposit interest rates which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
prepayment assumptions and adjustments to non time deposit rates at varying levels of interest rates are based primarily on historical experience and current market rates 
security portfolio maturities and prepayments are assumed to be reinvested in similar instruments and callable bond forecasts are adjusted at varying levels of interest rates 
while we believe such assumptions to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates  callable bond forecasts and non time deposit rate changes will approximate actual future results 
moreover  the net interest income sensitivity chart presented in table  net interest income sensitivity  assumes the composition of interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of the period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration of the maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
since the assumptions used in modeling changes in interest rates are uncertain  the simulation analysis should not be relied upon as being indicative of actual results 
the analysis may not consider all actions that wesbanco could employ in response to changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk policy limits are determined by measuring the anticipated change in net interest income over a twelve month period assuming an immediate and sustained basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates compared to a stable rate or base model 
wesbanco s current policy limits this exposure to of net interest income from the base model for a twelve month period

table of contents with the federal funds rates at at december   unchanged since the end of the second quarter after a basis point increase in the first half of  management believes that rates are directionally flat and the interest rate curve is expected to remain slightly inverted over the near term 
the earnings simulation model projects that net interest income for the next twelve month period would decrease by and if interest rates were to rise immediately by and basis points  respectively 
net interest income would increase by and if rates declined by and basis points 
the increase in liability sensitivity in a rising rate environment between december  and december  is a result of changes in balance sheet composition primarily as customers respond to higher short term rates in an inverted yield curve environment 
however  these changes favorably impacted wesbanco s sensitivity to falling interest rates which the alco believes is more probable than an increase in rates in as an alternative to the immediate rate shock analysis  the alco monitors interest rate risk by ramping or increasing interest rates basis points gradually over a twelve month period 
wesbanco s current policy limits this exposure to of net interest income from the base model for a twelve month period 
management believes that the ramping analysis reflects a more realistic movement of interest rates  whereas the immediate rate shock reflects a worse case scenario 
the simulation model using the basis point increasing rate ramp analysis projects that net interest income would decrease over the next twelve months  compared to a decrease at december  wesbanco also periodically measures the economic value of equity  which is defined as the market value of equity in various increasing and decreasing rate scenarios 
at december   the market value of equity as a percent of base in a basis point rising rate environment would decrease  while it would increase in a basis point falling rate environment 
wesbanco s policy is to limit such change to for a basis point change in interest rates 
wesbanco s alco evaluates various strategies to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
these strategies for much of emphasized reducing liability sensitivity in anticipation of continued rising interest rates  but more recently have focused on the potential for falling interest rates by late among the strategies that are evaluated from time to time are the possible reduction of certain fhlb borrowings  managing the level of wesbanco s fixed rate residential real estate loans maintained in the loan portfolio versus selling them in the secondary market  purchasing or originating adjustable rate loans  remixing of the loan portfolio as residential mortgages paydown into shorter lived  higher yielding commercial loans  offering special maturity  competitively priced short term certificates of deposit to offset runoff in money market deposit accounts  and in certain markets  regionally pricing certain deposit types to increase sales volume 
other strategies include emphasizing marketing programs to grow lower cost transaction accounts  and using the cdars program and structured repurchase agreements as alternative wholesale borrowing sources versus federal funds purchased and fhlb borrowings 
the potential use of interest rate swap agreements to match fund certain long term commercial loans or as a fair value or cash flow hedge against certain asset and liability types  and using investment security cash flows to fund realized loan growth or to pay down short term borrowings are also evaluated as potential strategies by alco
