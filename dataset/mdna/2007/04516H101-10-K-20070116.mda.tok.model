in may  the company entered into a settlement agreement with a stockholder group led by knightspoint partners ii  lp collectively  the knightspoint group 
as part of the settlement agreement  two of knightspoint group s proposed candidates  david m 
meyer and peter m 
weil  were appointed to the board of directors effective may  in addition to the appointment of messrs meyer and weil  a third independent director  to be mutually agreed upon by knightspoint group and the company  is to be added to the board as soon as practicable 
messrs meyer and weil were both elected to the board at the july  annual meeting of stockholders 

table of contents in november  the company s board of directors  in consultation with its independent financial advisor  houlihan lokey howard zukin  undertook an extensive review and evaluation of a range of strategic alternatives  including the possible sale of the company  to enhance value for all stockholders 
at the present time  the board has determined that the interests of the company s stockholders will be best served by focusing principally on improving the company s operations and financial performance 
the company s edc opened on november  the edc is equipped with state of the art automated systems designed to reduce the standard labor cost of an embroidered unit and provide the company what it believed to be a competitive advantage in the markets in which we compete while also providing us with sufficient embroidery capacity to accommodate anticipated future growth 
its operation in the first three quarters of fiscal was not as efficient as originally planned primarily due to issues caused by the programming requirements necessary to have the many varied automated systems work together 
management believes these issues were largely resolved in the fourth quarter of fiscal enabling management to realize per unit labor cost savings during fiscal as planned standards were attained 
although the company has reached its planned labor standard  the edc is operating substantially below its designed production capacity and burdening income from operations with significant unabsorbed fixed and indirect costs 
during the fourth quarter and months of fiscal  revenues in the company s green grass distribution channel decreased and  respectively  as compared to the same period of fiscal  primarily due to the company s decision to reduce the amount of off priced sales  increased competitive pressure and an overall continued softness in the golf market 
this reduction in sales volume in the golf channel in the fourth quarter and the months of fiscal had further negative impact on gross margin resulting from the under utilization of the edc s embroidery capacity specifically  the fixed and indirect costs associated with embroidery that were recognized in the period 
based on the company s anticipated sales volume for the first half of fiscal  the company believes that the under utilization of the edc will continue to negatively affect gross margin 
the company is currently evaluating various options  including  among others utilizing the facility on a more limited one shift embroidery basis through the use of supply chain planning to enable off shore embroidery  developing a joint venture to better utilize available embroidery capacity  as well as selling the edc and utilizing external distribution providers and contract embroiderers 
the company is in the initial stages of evaluating all available options and noted that there is no guarantee that any agreement will be reached as a result of this process

the time required to complete the initial design phase of the project exceeded the company s and the systems consultant s original estimate  pushing the first phase implementation of the system in the united kingdom to may management believes the second phase of implementation at the company s corporate headquarters will be delayed until the second half of fiscal or the beginning of fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net revenues were million for fiscal  an increase of from net revenues of million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased net sales in the gekko brands  llc gekko and ashworth uk  ltd  subsidiaries and continued growth in the company s retail  corporate and company owned outlet store distribution channels  partially offset by a decline in net revenues from the company s golf related distribution channel and the other international segment 
net revenues for the domestic segment excluding gekko decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal net revenues from the company s retail distribution channel increased million or to million from million in fiscal  primarily driven by the company s enhanced merchandising strategy focused on classic key item products with a lower percentage of fashion products

 quantifying financial statement misstatements sab 
sab provides interpretive guidance on how registrants should quantify misstatements when evaluating the materiality of financial statement errors 
sab also provides transition accounting and disclosure guidance for situations in which a material error existed in prior period financial statements  allowing companies to restate prior period financial statements or recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying sab through an adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the year of adoption 
sab is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company does not expect the adoption of sab will have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements
