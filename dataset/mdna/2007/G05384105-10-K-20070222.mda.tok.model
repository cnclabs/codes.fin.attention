item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of the results of our operations for the twelve months ended december   and and of our financial condition at december  this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and that are not historical facts  including statements about our beliefs and expectations 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and particularly under the headings risk factors  business and forward looking statements contained in item  item a and part i of this report  respectively 
aspen s year in review our principal financial objective for and beyond is to reduce the volatility of our annual earnings while continuing to deliver superior returns to our ordinary shareholders 
during we made significant changes to our business model consistent with this objective 
catastrophe risk management 
the biggest change for compared to previous years was in our approach to the management of natural catastrophe risk 
following the two active atlantic hurricane seasons of and we concluded that we needed to increase both our assessment of the quantum of risk from any given exposure and the prices we should charge for assuming that exposure 
the result has been a reduction in the absolute value of property limits exposed to hurricane and earthquake risk 
we have also reduced our maximum exposure to catastrophe risk  based on the output of statistical models  to of total shareholders equity for an event with a return period of in years and for an event with a return period of in years 
capital management 
also during we began a new phase of capital management which is intended to optimize our capital structure 
while total capital increased during the year  the proportion funded by our ordinary shareholders decreased from to 
this was achieved by repurchasing shares using the proceeds of the issuance of a new class of preference shares 
portfolio diversification 
was the first full year of operations of our specialty insurance and reinsurance segment which completed a key phase of the diversification strategy we have been pursuing since formation 
the benefits of this investment in quality underwriting teams can be seen in the results of that segment for which produced a combined ratio of 
investment management 
we have further developed our asset allocation strategy during the year by investing approximately of total invested assets and cash in funds of hedge funds 
the duration of our fixed income portfolio remains steady at approximately three years and our allocation to non government securities has increased 
as a result  we have increased the book yield of our fixed income portfolio from at december  to at december  financial overview the following overview of our  and operating results and financial condition is intended to identify important themes and should be read in conjunction with the more detailed discussion further below 
net income 
for we reported income after taxes of million with positive contributions from all of our four operating segments and an increase of in net investment income 
this is in strong contrast to our net loss of million for which included losses from the hurricanes of million net of reinsurance and taking into account additional premiums receivable and payable  tax and our estimate of the fair value of a potential recovery from our catastrophe risk contract

total gross written premiums decreased by in compared to the changes in gross premiums written in each of our segments for the twelve months ended december  and are as follows  with reductions shown as negative percentages

the most significant change over the last two years has been the development of our specialty insurance and reinsurance segment from of total gross written premiums in to in this is the result of our planned diversification into marine  energy and aviation insurance business 
the reduction in gross written premiums in the property reinsurance segment in was mainly due to the change in our approach to catastrophe risk management which resulted in the planned non renewal of  or reduced participation in  certain catastrophe exposed contracts  particularly in the risk excess and proportional lines of business 
there was also a reduction in loss related reinstatement premiums between and of million 
of the million increase in property reinsurance gross written premiums in  related to reinstatement premiums receivable as a result of the hurricane losses up million over 
new business written by our then recently formed team at aspen re america contributed million of the increase and the property component of a proportional reinsurance of a participant in a lloyd s syndicate contributed a further million 
loss ratio 
we monitor the ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to net earned premium the loss ratio as a measure of relative underwriting performance where a lower ratio represents a better result than a higher ratio 
the loss ratios for our four business segments for the twelve months ended december   and were as follows

the most significant factor in the reduction of loss ratios in was the benign loss experience of our property reinsurance segment compared to the significant hurricane losses in and casualty reinsurance continued to have good experience in the accident year and has benefited from million of reserve releases from prior years following favorable loss experience 
specialty insurance and reinsurance has had good loss experience in across most of its business lines and also benefited from a million prior year reserve release 
the only increase in loss ratio over the prior year was in our property and casualty insurance segment which was due to disappointing results in our us surplus lines property insurance business 
reserve releases 
the loss ratios take into account any changes in our assessments of reserves for unpaid claims and loss adjustment expenses arising from earlier years 
in each of the years ended december   and  we recorded a reduction in the level of reserves for prior years 
the amounts of these reductions and their effect on the loss ratio in each year are shown in the following table

the increases in the policy acquisition expense ratio over the last two years principally reflect changing business mix 
higher levels of acquisition costs do not necessarily imply lower potential underwriting margins because the cost of acquisition is factored into our premium pricing models whenever possible 
over the same period our operating and administrative expenses have increased in bermuda  the u 
s and the uk due to the hiring of new teams of underwriters and increased investment in support functions and infrastructure

the increases over the last two years equate to a compound average annual increase of and were attributable to both positive cash flow and rising book yields

the amounts outstanding under our senior notes were the only material debt that we had outstanding as of december  and management monitors the ratio of debt to total capital  with total capital being defined as shareholders equity plus outstanding debt 
at december   this ratio was  
our preference shares are classified in our balance sheet as equity but may receive a different treatment in some cases under the capital adequacy assessments made by certain rating agencies 
such securities are often referred to as hybrids as they have certain attributes of both debt and equity 
we also monitor the ratio of the total of debt and hybrids to total capital and this stands at as of december liquidity 
management monitors the liquidity of aspen holdings and of each of its insurance subsidiaries 
with respect to aspen holdings  management monitors its ability to service debt  to finance dividend payments and to provide financial support to the insurance subsidiaries 
during  aspen holdings received million in dividends from aspen uk holdings and million in interest payments under our intercompany loan 
as at december   aspen holdings held million in cash and cash equivalents which  taken together with our credit facilities  management considered sufficient to provide us liquidity at such time 
at december   the insurance subsidiaries held million in cash and cash equivalents that are readily realizable securities 
management monitors the value  currency and duration of the cash and investments within its insurance subsidiaries to ensure that they are able to meet their insurance and other liabilities as they become due and was satisfied that there was a comfortable margin of liquidity as at december  and for the foreseeable future 
as of december   we had in issue million and million in letters of credit to cedents  of which million and million were collateralized 
our reinsurance receivables decreased by from  million at december  to million at december   mainly as a result of amounts received from our reinsurers in respect of and hurricane claims 
market conditions  rate trends and developments in january is an important renewal month for our reinsurance segment and much of our specialty lines  representing about of our expected gross premium for the full year 
property reinsurance pricing at january for us peak zone property catastrophe reinsurance remained very attractive at near record highs 
many accounts registered significant price increases over the previous year  although not quite reaching the levels achieved in july european renewals  however  recorded rates that were flat or declining 
casualty reinsurance 
casualty reinsurance pricing is reflecting modest declines in rates on original business  particularly on programs with zero or minimal loss activity 
in our international casualty account  we recorded average rate declines on a premium weighted average basis of approximately 
in our us casualty treaty account we expect rates to trend down  with workers compensation catastrophe reinsurance experiencing the most downward movement 
specialty insurance and reinsurance 
in our specialty insurance and reinsurance segment  prices remained flat on average for business written in january 
this figure excludes aviation insurance  which has little renewal activity during the first two months of the year 
in marine hull insurance  rates have remained firm and we achieved an average rate increase of approximately on renewal business 
rates for our offshore energy physical damage account are flat or declining slightly 
in our marine liability lines we have achieved modest rate increases of about 
within our specialty reinsurance account  we experienced a better than expected rate reduction of approximately 
property and casualty insurance our insurance segment does not typically experience a great deal of renewal business during january with the first major insurance renewal date expected at the end of march 
uk commercial property and commercial liability insurance rates remain challenging and we expect this trend to continue in reinsurance ceded 
in we will continue to purchase reinsurance protection for our insurance lines of business broadly in line with previous years 
however  we will substantially reduce our purchase of property retrocessional cover in compared to previous years 
this follows a systematic repositioning during of our portfolio designed to reduce volatility and diversify our exposures 
starting january   we set out to reduce our in force exposures to peak zone catastrophe risk  but because those exposures were still very significant at the beginning of the year  we bought a large amount of property retrocessional cover at a cost of million 
we start with this repositioning successfully completed and in we do not expect to exceed an expenditure of million on property retrocessional coverage 
we have the ability to do this because our reduced catastrophe exposures allow us to stay within our risk tolerances without reliance on retrocession 
recent developments the legislation enacted by the state of florida in january which increased the reinsurance capacity of the state s reinsurance facility provides a significant additional supply of capital to a part of the worldwide property catastrophe business  where previously buying demand greatly exceeded capital supply 
as a result of this legislation we expect prices in florida to decrease 
in addition  property reinsurance rates worldwide may also decrease due to the redirection of the capital that entered the industry to take advantage of perceived attractive rates in florida  as this capital may now target other exposures 
for additional information on the florida legislation  see risk factors recent events may result in political  regulatory and industry initiatives which could adversely affect our business 
we have made a first assessment of the limited loss information now available and of our potential exposures to windstorm kyrill in january and our initial estimate is that the impact before tax on the company will be in the range of to million 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements contain certain amounts that are inherently subjective in nature and require management to make assumptions and best estimates to determine the reported values 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
a statement of all the significant accounting policies we use to prepare our financial statements is included in the notes to the financial statements 
if factors such as those described in item a  risk factors cause actual events to differ from the assumptions used in applying the accounting policy and calculating financial results  there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
written premiums 
written premiums are comprised of the estimated premiums on contracts of insurance and reinsurance entered into in the reporting period  except in the case of proportional reinsurance contracts  where written premium relates only to our estimated proportional share of premiums due on contracts entered into by the ceding company prior to the end of the reporting period 
all premium estimates are reviewed regularly  comparing actual reported premiums to expected ultimate premiums along with a review of the collectability of premiums receivable 
based on management s review  the appropriateness of the premium estimates is evaluated  and any adjustments to these estimates are recorded in the periods in which they become known 
adjustments to original premium estimates could be material and these adjustments may directly and significantly impact earnings in the period they are determined because the subject premium may be fully or substantially earned 
we refer to premiums receivable which are not fixed at the inception of the contract as adjustment premiums 
the proportion of adjustable premiums included in the premium estimates varies between business lines with the largest adjustment premiums associated with property reinsurance business and the smallest with property and liability insurance 
adjustment premiums are most significant in relation to reinsurance contracts 
differing considerations apply to non proportional and proportional treaties as follows 
non proportional treaties 
a large number of the reinsurance contracts we write are written on a non proportional or excess of loss treaty basis 
as the ultimate level of business written by each cedent can only be estimated at the time the reinsurance is placed  the reinsurance contracts generally stipulate a minimum and deposit premium payable under the contract with an adjustable premium determined by variables such as the number of contracts covered by the reinsurance  the total premium received by the cedent and the nature of the exposures assumed 
minimum and deposit premiums generally cover the majority of premiums due under such treaty reinsurance contracts and the adjustable portion of the premium is usually a small portion of the total premium receivable 
for excess of loss contracts  the minimum and deposit premium  as defined in the contract  is generally considered to be the best estimate of the contract s written premium at inception 
accordingly  this is the amount we generally record as written premium in the period the underlying risks incept 
during the life of a contract  notifications from cedents and brokers may affect the estimate of ultimate premium and result in either increases or reductions in reported revenue 
changes in estimated adjustable premiums do not generally have a significant impact on short term liquidity as the payment of adjustment premiums generally occurs after the expiration of a contract 
many non proportional treaties also include provision for the payment to us by the cedent of reinstatement premiums based on loss experience under such contracts 
reinstatement premiums are the premiums charged for the restoration of the reinsurance limit of an excess of loss contract to its full amount after payment by the reinsurer of losses as a result of an occurrence 
these premiums relate to the future coverage obtained during the remainder of the initial policy term and are included in revenue in the same period as the corresponding losses 
proportional treaties treaty pro rata 
estimates of premiums assumed under treaty pro rata reinsurance contracts are recorded in the period in which the underlying risks are expected to incept and are based on information provided by brokers and ceding companies and estimates of the underlying economic conditions at the time the risk is underwritten 
we estimate premium receivable initially and update our estimates regularly throughout the contract term based on treaty statements received from the ceding company 
the reported gross written premiums for treaty pro rata business includes estimates of premiums due to the company but not yet reported by the cedent because of time delays between contracts being written by our cedents and the submission of treaty statements to the company 
this additional premium is normally described as pipeline premium 
treaty statements disclose information on the underlying contracts of insurance written by our cedents and are generally submitted on a monthly or quarterly basis  from to days in arrears 
in order to report all risks incepting prior to a period end  we estimate the premiums written between the last submitted treaty statement and the period end 
the segment for which treaty pro rata is most relevant is our property reinsurance segment in which we wrote million in gross written premium in or of our property reinsurance segment  of which million was estimated  and million was reported by the cedents 
we estimate that the impact of a million change in our estimated gross premiums written in our property treaty pro rata business would have an impact of  on our net income before tax for our property reinsurance segment  excluding the impact of fixed costs such as reinsurance premiums and operating expenses 
the most likely drivers of change in the estimates in decreasing order of magnitude are 
spacer

spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
changes in the renewal rate or rate of new business acceptances by the cedent insurance companies leading to lower or greater volumes of ceded premiums than our estimate  which could result from changes in the relevant primary market that could affect more than one of our cedents or could be a consequence of changes in marketing strategy or risk appetite by a particular cedent  
spacer

spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
changes in the rates being charged by cedents  and 
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
differences between the pattern of inception dates assumed in our estimate and the actual pattern of inception dates 
we anticipate that ultimate premiums might reasonably be expected to vary by up to as a result of variations in one or more of the assumptions described above  although larger variations are possible 
based on gross written premiums of million in our property reinsurance treaty pro rata account as of december   a variation of could increase or reduce net income before taxation by approximately million 
earned premiums 
premiums are recognized as earned evenly over the policy periods using the daily pro rata method 
the premium related to the unexpired portion of each policy at the end of the reporting period is included in the balance sheet as unearned premiums 
premiums receivable 
premiums receivable are recorded as amounts due less any required provision for doubtful accounts 
a significant portion of amounts included as premiums receivable  which represent estimated premiums written  net of commissions  is not currently due based on the terms of the underlying contracts 
in determining whether or not any bad debt provision is necessary  we consider the financial security of the policyholder  past payment history and any collateral held 
we have not made a provision for doubtful accounts in relation to assumed premium estimates as adjustable premiums are considered to be inseparable from minimum and deposit premiums 
in addition  based on the above process  management believes that the premium estimates included in premiums receivable will be collectible and  therefore  we have not maintained a bad debt provision for doubtful accounts on the premiums at december  risk transfer swap 
our catastrophe risk transfer swap falls under the requirement of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas and is therefore recorded in the balance sheet at fair value with any changes in the fair value shown on the consolidated statement of operations 
this contract requires us to make quarterly payments in return for which we are entitled to receive a total of up to million on the occurrence of hurricanes making landfall in florida and causing insured damage in excess of billion or earthquakes in california causing insured damage in excess of billion 
the determination of whether or not we are entitled to a recovery depends on estimates of insured damage published pcs 
the amount of any recovery due increases on a linear basis from to million depending on the pcs estimate with the full amount of million receivable at or above billion for a hurricane event or billion for an earthquake event 
if a recovery becomes due then the future payments under the contract may be reduced 
as we provided in full for these future payments when the contract commenced any actual or projected reduction in this liability is also reflected as a gain in the statement of operations 
the latest estimate of the insured loss arising from hurricane katrina published by pcs on december  was billion which entitles the company to a recovery of approximately million of which million was paid to us during based on the record of increasing pcs estimates following previous natural catastrophe losses in the united states  we expect that future estimates by pcs of this loss will increase 
we have taken this and the illiquid nature of the catastrophe risk transfer swap market into account in our valuation of this contract as at december  as there is no quoted market value available for this derivative  the fair value is determined by management using internal models taking into account changes in the market for catastrophe reinsurance contracts with similar economic characteristics and the potential for recoveries from events preceding the valuation date 
the amount recognized could be materially different from the amount realized in actual payments to us made under the contract 
credit insurance contract 
on november   the company entered into a credit insurance contract which  subject to its terms  insures the company against losses due to the inability of one or more of our reinsurance counterparties to meet their financial obligations to the company 
the company considers that under sfas this contract is a financial guarantee insurance contract that does not qualify for exemption from treatment for accounting purposes as a derivative 
this is because it provides for the final settlement  expected to take place two years after expiry of cover  to include an amount attributable to outstanding and ibnr claims which may not at that point of time be due and payable to the company 
as a result of the application of derivative accounting rules under sfas  the contract is treated as an asset and measured at the directors estimate of its fair value 
changes in the estimated fair value from time to time will be included in the consolidated statement of operations 
the contract is for a maximum of five years and provides cover for a named panel of reinsurers up to individual defined sub limits 
the contract does allow  subject to certain conditions  for substitution and replacement of panel members if the company s panel of reinsurers changes 
payments are made on a quarterly basis throughout the period of the contract based on the aggregate limit  which was set initially at million but is subject to adjustment 
reserving approach 
we take all reasonable steps to ensure that we have appropriate information regarding our claims exposures 
however  given the uncertainty in establishing claims liabilities  it is likely that the final outcome will prove to be different from the original provision established 
prior to the selection by management of our best estimate of our reserves  our actuarial team employs a number of techniques to establish a range of estimates the actuarial range 
sources of information 
claims information received typically includes the loss date  details of the claim  the recommended reserve and reports from the loss adjusters dealing with the claim 
in respect of pro rata treaties we receive regular statements bordereaux which provide paid and outstanding claims information  often with large losses separately identified 
following widely reported loss events such as natural catastrophes and aeroplane crashes we adopt a proactive approach to establish our likely exposure to claims by reviewing policy listings and contacting brokers and policyholders as appropriate 
reported claims 
for reported claims  reserves are established on a case by case basis within the parameters of coverage provided in the insurance policy or reinsurance agreement 
in estimating the cost of these claims  we consider circumstances related to the claims as reported  any information available from cedents and loss adjustors and information on the cost of settling claims with similar characteristics in previous periods 
in addition  for significant events such as the hurricanes in  for example  the detailed analysis of our potential exposures included information obtained directly from cedents which has yet to be processed through market systems enabling us to reduce the time lag between a significant event occurring and establishing case reserves 
this additional information is also incorporated into the analysis used to determine the actuarial ibnr 
reinsurance intermediaries are used to assist in obtaining and validating information from cedents but we establish all reserves 
in addition  we may engage loss adjusters and perform on site cedent audits to validate the information provided 
disputes do occur with cedents  but the number and frequency are generally low 
in the event of a dispute  intermediaries are used to try to resolve the dispute 
if a resolution cannot be reached  then the contracts typically provide for binding arbitration 
ibnr claims 
we establish reserves for ibnr claims using established actuarial methods which generally rely to a greater or lesser extent on historical information but also consider such variables as changes in policy terms and coverage  changes in legislative conditions and judicial interpretation of insurance policies and inflation 
we take into account the quality of the historical information available and where appropriate historical trends are used to validate information received from cedents 
the higher degree of uncertainty associated with reserves for reinsurance business is associated with the assumptions used in deriving ibnr claims 
where they are based on an analysis of past loss experience  then the principal assumption is that past patterns of development will be repeated on current business 
the process of extrapolation is by necessity one involving subjective judgment because the actuary has to take into account the impact of the changing business mix as well as changes in legislative conditions  changes in judicial interpretation of legal liability policy coverages and inflation 
these factors are incorporated in the recommended reserve range from which management selects its best point estimate 
for classes of business where early claims experience may not provide a sound statistical basis to estimate the loss reserves  our approach is to establish an initial expected loss and loss expense ratio 
this is based on one or more of a an analysis of our own claims experience to date  b market benchmark data  c a contract by contract analysis  and d an analysis of a portfolio of similar business written by syndicate  as available  adjusted by an index reflecting how insurance rates  terms and conditions have changed 
this initial expected loss and loss expense ratio is then modified in light of the actual experience to date measured against the expected experience 
loss reserves for known catastrophic events are based upon a detailed analysis of our reported losses and potential exposures conducted in conjunction with our underwriters 
actuarial range of gross reserves 
the following table sets out the actuarial range of gross reserves for each of our segments and compares it to management s selected best estimate as at december

the actuarial ranges are not intended to include the minimum or maximum amount that the claims may ultimately settle at  but are designed to provide management with ranges from which it is reasonable to select a single best estimate for inclusion in our financial statements taking into account the impact that all the factors affecting the reserves may have 
the amounts shown for the lower and upper ends of the actuarial range are different from the sums of the corresponding amounts for the four segments 
the difference  which we show in the tables as potential variation  takes into account the fact that at the higher end of the actuarial range we do not expect all segments to deteriorate at the same time hence the variation credit and  conversely  at the lower end of the actuarial range not all segments will improve simultaneously hence the debit 
selection of reported gross reserves 
in selecting our best estimates of the reserves for each line of business we take into account all of the factors set out above  and in particular the quality of the historical information we have on which to establish our reserves 
in addition  consideration is given to the point estimate produced by our independent consulting actuaries  which was towards the upper end of the range for each of the years ended december  and actuarial range of net reserves 
in determining the range of net reserves  we estimate recoveries due under our proportional and excess of loss reinsurance programs 
for proportional reinsurance we apply the appropriate cession percentages to estimate how much of the gross reserves will be collectable 
for excess of loss recoveries  if the upper and lower estimates of gross losses are contained within our reinsurance program then there will be minimal movement in the net losses but if gross losses are below the attachment point of the excess of loss program then movements in gross losses are replicated as movements in the net loss 
reinsurance recoveries in respect of estimated ibnr claims are assumed to be consistent with the historical pattern of such recoveries  adjusted to reflect changes in the nature and extent of our reinsurance program over time 
an assessment is also made of the collectability of reinsurance recoveries taking into account market data on the financial strength of each of the reinsurance companies 
the net actuarial range for reserves for losses and loss expenses assuming that net reserves move in proportion to gross would be between  million and  million 
the actual net reserves established as at december  were  million 
uncertainties 
while the reported reserves make a reasonable provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense obligations  we note that the process of estimating required reserves does  by its very nature  involve uncertainty and therefore the ultimate claims may fall outside the actuarial range 
the level of uncertainty can be influenced by such factors as the existence of coverage with long duration reporting patterns and changes in claims handling practices  as well as the other factors described above 
because many of the coverages underwritten involve claims that may not be ultimately settled for many years after they are incurred  subjective judgments as to the ultimate exposure to losses are an integral and necessary component of the loss reserving process 
we review regularly our reserves  using a variety of statistical and actuarial techniques to analyze current claims costs  frequency and severity data  and prevailing economic  social and legal factors 
reserves established in prior periods are adjusted as claims experience develops and new information becomes available 
estimates of ibnr are generally subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than estimates of the cost of settling claims already notified to the company  where more information about the claim event is generally available 
ibnr claims often may not be apparent to the insured until many years after the event giving rise to the claims has happened 
lines of business where the ibnr proportion of the total reserve is high  such as liability insurance  will typically display greater variations between initial estimates and final outcomes because of the greater degree of difficulty of estimating these reserves 
lines of business where claims are typically reported relatively quickly after the claim event tend to display lower levels of volatility between initial estimates and final outcomes 
reinsurance claims are subject to a longer time lag both in their reporting and in their time to final settlement 
the time lag is a factor which is included in the projections to ultimate claims within the actuarial analyses and helps to explain why in general a higher proportion of the initial reinsurance reserves are represented by ibnr than for insurance reserves for business in the same class 
delays in receiving information from cedents are an expected part of normal business operations and are included within the statistical estimate of ibnr to the extent that current levels of backlog are consistent with historical data 
currently  there are no processing backlogs which would materially affect our financial statements 
allowance is made  however  for changes or uncertainties which may create distortions in the underlying statistics or which might cause the cost of unsettled claims to increase or reduce when compared with the cost of previously settled claims including

the most significant change over the last two years has been the development of our specialty insurance and reinsurance segment from of total gross written premiums in to in this is the result of our planned diversification into marine  energy and aviation insurance business 
of the million increase in property reinsurance gross written premiums in  related to reinstatement premiums receivable as a result of the hurricane losses up million over 
new business written by our then recently formed team at aspen re america contributed million of the increase and the property component of a proportional reinsurance of a participant in a lloyd s syndicate contributed a further million 
the reduction in gross written premiums in the property reinsurance segment in was mainly due to the change in our approach to catastrophe risk management which resulted in the planned non renewal of  or reduced participation in  certain catastrophe exposed contracts  particularly in the risk excess and proportional lines of business 
there was also a reduction in loss related reinstatement premiums between and of million 
net premiums written 
net premiums written increased by in compared to the increase was not in line with the reduction in gross written premiums due to the significantly higher reinsurance costs in the high costs in were a result of the hurricanes in as  under the terms of our reinsurance contracts  we were obligated to make certain additional payments usually in the form of reinstatement premiums to provide recoveries in respect of more than one loss 
the amount of the additional payment obligations arising as a result of the hurricanes was million or of the gross premiums written for the year  whereas in  we had reinstatement premiums of million or of gross premiums written 
gross premiums earned 
gross premiums earned reflect the portion of gross premiums written which are recorded as revenues over the policy periods of the risks we write 
therefore  the earned premium recorded in any year includes premium from policies incepting in prior years and excludes premium to be earned subsequent to the balance sheet date 
gross premiums earned in increased by compared to and by in compared to in both years the growth in gross premiums earned was primarily as a result of the growth in business written in our marine  specialty liability  energy and aviation insurance lines  which increased by million in and million in net premiums earned 
net premiums earned increased by in compared to and by in compared to the increases for each of our segments were as follows

the largest percentage increase in related to our marine and aviation insurance business written in our specialty segment and was driven primarily by increases in written premium in our energy and aviation accounts 
insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses 
our losses and loss adjustment expenses decreased significantly in the year mainly due to the absence of catastrophic losses in the year compared to and in we suffered million of losses net of reinsurance from hurricanes charley  frances  ivan  jeanne and typhoon songda and in million of losses net of reinsurance from hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma before potential receipts under our cat swap 
our insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses included paid claims of million in  million in and million in the underlying changes in accident year loss ratios which exclude the impact of the catastrophes and krw losses in all years by segment for the twelve months ended december   and are shown in the following table

we monitor the ratio of expenses to gross earned premium the gross expense ratio as a measure of the cost effectiveness of our business acquisition  operating and administrative processes 
the table below presents the contribution of the policy acquisition expenses and operating and administrative expenses to the gross expense ratios and the total net expense ratios for the twelve months ended december   and we also show the effect of reinsurance which impacts the reported net expense ratio by expressing the expenses as a proportion of net earned premiums

net investment income 
net investment income consists primarily of interest on fixed income securities and is stated after deduction of expenses relating to the management of our investments 
the total for includes million from funds of hedge funds in which we made our first investment of million on april  net investment income increased by in compared to and by in compared to the increases have been driven by rising interest rates  fixed income sector allocation changes and asset allocation changes translating into higher book yields and by increases in our total cash and investment balances by in and in the increase in cash and investment balances in includes approximately million after expenses in respect of the issuance of new ordinary shares and perpetual piers million in respect of issuance of our senior notes 
during  our fixed income portfolio book yield increased from as of december  to as of december  in  we continued to review our fixed income portfolio duration  as interest rates rose 
however  the shape of the yield curve caused us to hold off extending duration beyond three years 
as a result our fixed income portfolio duration remained steady at approximately three years for unrealized gains and losses on derivatives 
the gains and losses result from changes in the estimated fair value of a catastrophe risk transfer swap contract entered into for a three year period in august hurricane katrina has triggered the contract and we first recognized this at a value of million in the fourth quarter of resulting  net of other valuation changes  in a gain of million being recorded in the latest estimate of the insured losses arising from hurricane katrina published by pcs on december  was billion which entitles us to a cumulative recovery of approximately million of which million was received during based on the record of increasing pcs estimates following previous natural catastrophes in the united states  we expect that future estimates by pcs of this loss will increase and have therefore maintained a residual valuation of million for our hurricane katrina recovery 
the valuation losses recorded in and relate to changes in the non hurricane katrina part of our fair valuation of the overall contract which are determined by the directors  taking into account the passage of time and any material changes in pricing of similar contracts in the market 
we determine these valuations taking into account the illiquid nature of the catastrophe risk transfer swap market 
see above critical accounting policies risk transfer swap 
income loss before tax 
in  income before tax was million and comprised million of underwriting profit  million in net investment income  million of net exchange gains  million of interest payable and million of other expenses 
in we incurred losses before tax of million 
the principal source of the loss in was underwriting losses of million in our property reinsurance segment resulting from the hurricanes 
our underwriting losses were offset by million in respect of net investment income and a million net unrealized gain on derivatives 
we also incurred losses of million from the revaluation or sale of non functional foreign currencies and million from the sale of investments 
income before tax in was million  which included underwriting income of million and net investment income of million 
income tax expense 
income tax expense increased to million in from million in and million in the tax charge in each year relates to our uk operations which remained profitable throughout the period 
our tax rate in was compared to in  the most recent previous year in which we reported a profit 
our effective tax rate has decreased since due to a greater proportion of the company s profit being derived from our bermudian operations 
net income loss 
in  we had net income of million  equivalent to diluted earnings per ordinary share of based on the weighted average number of shares in issue during the period 
in our net loss of million loss was equivalent to a loss per ordinary share of 
this compares to a net income of million in  equivalent to diluted earnings per ordinary share 
preference share dividends are deducted from net income for the purpose of calculating earnings per ordinary share 
underwriting results by operating segments our business segments are based on how we monitor the performance of our underwriting operations 
management measures segment results on the basis of the combined ratio  which is obtained by dividing the sum of the losses and loss expenses  acquisition expenses and operating and administrative expenses which cannot be attributed directly to any one segment by net premiums earned 
as a relatively new company  our historical combined ratio may not be indicative of future underwriting performance 
we do not manage our assets by segment  accordingly  investment income and total assets are not allocated to the individual segments 
operating and administrative expenses are allocated to segments based on each segment s proportional share of gross premiums written 
the following tables summarize gross and net premiums written and earned  underwriting results  and combined ratios and reserves for each of our four business segments for the twelve months ended december   and

the reduction in gross written premiums in the property reinsurance segment in was due to the change in our approach to catastrophe risk management which resulted in the planned non renewal of  or reduced participation in  certain catastrophe exposed contracts  particularly in the risk excess and proportional lines of business 
there was also a reduction in loss related reinstatement premiums between and of million 
in reinstatement premiums and other similar revenues of million were recognized 
the risk excess and proportional treaty accounts included million of premium from aspen re america in with million in and million in this business is generally less exposed to catastrophe risk than the risk excess and proportional treaties written by aspen re and aspen bermuda 
reinsurance ceded 
reinsurance costs in decreased by million compared to primarily as a result of the million of additional ceded premiums to reinstate reinsurance protections following the hurricanes million 
there was also less spent in on lower level retrocessional contracts that respond to a second or subsequent loss in the same year because the market for this type of cover became prohibitively expensive following the multiple storm losses of and losses and loss adjustment expenses 
losses and loss adjustment expenses includes the following losses

there were no material property reinsurance losses reported in year and therefore the most significant loss reported in the year has been the deterioration in the hurricane loss estimates in the period 
the balance of losses  excluding the losses described above  was million in million  million representing of net premiums earned  
in  we also recorded a million reserve strengthening in addition to that required for the windstorm losses 
this represented of net earned premiums 
similarly  in additions to reserves of million represented of net earned premiums whereas in  we recognized a million reserve release of net earned premiums 
in  we benefited from a very low level of reported losses  whereas in and  we experienced a higher than expected level of attritional losses mainly from lower layers of risk excess programs which have now been discontinued 
as a result of the hurricanes  our loss ratio in this segment for the year was as net premiums earned in the year were substantially less than the losses incurred 
losses and loss adjustment expenses for are stated after deduction of million in reinsurance recoveries received or receivable million 
any failure to collect these amounts as a result of the inability of our reinsures to pay or as a result of disputes which are not resolved in our favor could result in charges in future years 
see part i  item  business underwriting  risk management and reinsurance 
policy acquisition  operating and administrative expenses 
total expenses in increased by to million  equivalent to of gross earned premiums 
the increase from million or of gross premiums earned in reflected changes in business mix increasing average commissions 
it also reflected the decision in to increase the proportion of administrative expenses allocated to the property reinsurance segment to better reflect the costs of actuarial and risk management support to this segment and in response to cost pressures in bermuda caused by competition for skilled staff 
total expenses in increased by over  mainly as a result of additional acquisition costs on the increased level of business written 
expenses as a percentage of gross premiums earned were in and in the decrease in the percentage of expenses to gross premiums earned compared to is attributable to two principal factors in  gross premiums earned increased by million due to reinstatement premiums  which typically do not incur commission charges  and as other business lines developed  a greater amount of central administrative expenses was allocated to the other segments 
casualty reinsurance our casualty reinsurance segment is written mainly on a treaty basis with a small proportion of facultative risks 
the casualty treaty reinsurance is primarily written on an excess of loss basis and includes coverage for claims arising from automobile accidents  employers liability  professional indemnity and other third party liabilities 
it is written in respect of cedents located mainly in the united states  the united kingdom  europe and australia 
the casualty facultative business covers united states umbrella  workers compensation and general liability business

policy acquisition expenses increased by percentage points between and due to the recognition of profit commission and no claims bonuses on certain contracts  the impact of higher average commission rates for non us treaty business and the greater proportion of structured business which attracts higher commission rates than the balance of the book 
the operating expense ratio has fallen by percentage points in compared to due to the impact of a reduction in reinsurance costs and a slight reduction in allocated indirect costs 
the expense ratio for was approximately percentage points higher than in because us treaty which incurs higher commission rates than other lines of business made up a greater proportion of the business written

although the premiums written under the heading worldwide property are at similar levels in and there has been a significant change in this account 
in and previously  it included significant amounts of us direct and facultative business  which we ceased to underwrite at the end of  whereas in  following the appointment of a new team  it comprises international facultative property business with incidental us exposure 
in  we increased our us surplus lines in both property million  million and casualty million  million 
we wrote less uk liability business than in as rates had dropped

property 
the loss ratio for property insurance increased from in to in this was due in part to two factory fires in europe million or of net earned premiums  but the main cause was a disappointing result in our us property surplus lines business which suffered from an unexpected frequency of large fire losses which cost million  representing of net earned premiums

casualty 
the loss ratio for casualty has held steady between and on lower volumes 
the loss ratio for was improved by approximately from prior year reserve releases  
prior year reserve releases in the period were largely due to better than expected development of incurred claims  as further described below under reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses prior year loss reserves 
policy acquisition  operating and administrative expenses 
total expenses were million for  equivalent to of net earned premiums 
the reduction in the acquisition ratio was the result of profit commission being recognized by the uk liability account following the commutation of proportional reinsurance contracts with montpelier re covering the years  and the increase in expense ratio was due to the premium growth in the us property business which attracted a higher operating and administrative charge to the segment whereas reductions in uk business written have not resulted in reductions in administrative costs 
total expenses in increased by compared to  largely as a result of increases in gross premiums earned in this segment 
the expense ratio increased slightly in by percentage points 
the rate of increase in expenses was consistent with the rate of increase in gross premiums earned which was in reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses provision is made at the end of each year for the estimated cost of claims incurred but not settled at the balance sheet date  including the cost of ibnr claims 
the estimated cost of claims includes expenses to be incurred in settling claims and a deduction for the expected value of salvage and other recoveries 
estimated amounts recoverable from reinsurers on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are calculated to arrive at a net claims reserve 
as required under us gaap  no provision is made for our exposure to natural or man made catastrophes other than for events occurring before the balance sheet date

the reduction in the level of gross reserves between and is attributable to the payment during the year of hurricane losses recorded as outstandings and ibnr at december  and the absence in of any corresponding large major catastrophe loss 
the impact from the payment of hurricane losses is most significant in the property reinsurance segment where gross outstandings were reduced by million 
gross ibnr for the property reinsurance segment has also reduced significantly in the year as losses which have been anticipated within ibnr crystallize and are formally reported as outstanding claims 
reserves for the casualty reinsurance segment have continued to increase reflecting the long tail nature of the segment 
specialty insurance and reinsurance reserves have increased as the class expands and reserves have moved from ibnr to outstandings due to the formal reporting of hurricane losses in the marine energy and liability accounts 
property and casualty insurance reserves remain stable reflecting the maturity of the class 
the movement between ibnr and outstanding reserves in the segment was due to the recognition of hurricane losses and the recording of large commercial property losses in the uk and uk property accounts 
prior year loss reserves 
in the twelve months ended december   and  there was a reduction of our estimate of the ultimate claims to be paid 
an analysis of this reduction by segment is as follows

for the twelve months ended december  the analysis of the development by each segment is as follows property reinsurance 
property reinsurance deteriorated by million in of which million is attributable to hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma and million to the hurricanes 
the methodology we use to determine the hurricane ultimates is to review each cedent s position with respect to its reported claims and establish an expected ibnr utilizing information from that client 
at year end we held a total ibnr for hurricane katrina for property reinsurance of million 
in setting our loss estimates for hurricane katrina  we have taken account of evolving litigation relating to coverage issues and included additional provisions where appropriate 
because of this ongoing litigation  there remains significant uncertainty as to our ultimate costs of hurricane katrina 
casualty reinsurance 
the lines contributing to the casualty reinsurance reserves release of million  are million attributed to international casualty and million to us casualty 
claims in these lines may take several years to emerge 
nonetheless  the experience to date compared with our starting loss ratios and expected patterns have been better than expected 
specialty insurance and reinsurance 
the specialty insurance and reinsurance reserves release is million 
this is spread across several lines of which the largest contributors are aviation reinsurance million and the run off of quota shares written in and million followed by marine hull insurance million  aviation insurance million and contingency reinsurance million 
we have had increases in hurricane katrina in the specialty accounts of million partially offset by favorable experience on the balance of the affected classes 
property and casualty insurance 
the property and casualty insurance reserves release is million 
employers and public liability written in the uk had a reserves release of million with uk surplus lines casualty business contributing a further million 
these are also long tail classes where claims can take several years to emerge  particularly latent diseases which are monitored and reserved for separately 
experience has been better than expected leading to the observed reserves release in offsetting these releases is a deterioration of million in the hurricane reserves of which million is attributable to hurricane katrina for the discontinued worldwide property account from late advised claims exceeding ibnr 
for the twelve months ended december  the analysis of the development by each segment is as follows property reinsurance 
the net reserves of the property reinsurance segment as at december  were million which included specific case reserves in relation to hurricanes charley  frances  ivan and jeanne and typhoon songda 
further claims information received in relation to hurricane ivan and typhoon songda windstorms gave rise to a million increase in reserves in the period 
in addition  further claims notifications in respect of certain treaty risk excess contracts received during the twelve months to december  highlighted deterioration in claims development resulting in a strengthening in claims reserves of million 
casualty reinsurance 
as at december  the casualty reinsurance segment held net claims reserves of million 
favorable trends in claims development in the non us casualty and us casualty lines have seen claims develop at a slower than expected rate  and led to a release of prior year net reserves of million 
most of the release in respect of the us casualty lines relates to workers compensation catastrophe excess of loss contracts which have a short reporting period 
specialty insurance and reinsurance 
as at december  the specialty segment held net claims reserves of million  partly derived through the wellington quota share arrangements 
these have developed better than anticipated resulting in a release of million 
a better than expected development from the windstorms saw a favorable development of million  while a significantly lower than anticipated development of ibnr claims  particularly in the specialty reinsurance lines led to a favorable development of million 
property and casualty insurance 
the net reserves of the insurance segment as at december  were million 
development in the shorter tail property insurance lines has seen a lower claim development than had been expected and the liability insurance class has to date seen a lower level of incurred claims than projected giving rise to a release in net reserves of million across these two classes 
for the twelve months ended december  the analysis of the favorable development by each segment is as follows property reinsurance 
the net reserves of the property reinsurance segment as at december  were million  which included specific case reserves in relation to brush fires in the united states  hurricanes fabian and isabel and a phillips factory loss in normandy  france 
further claims information received during the twelve months ended december  highlighted a lower severity of these reported claims than was originally anticipated and gave rise to a million reduction in reserves in the period 
casualty reinsurance 
the net reserves of the casualty reinsurance segment as at december  were million 
we do not receive notice of most of the claims in this segment until a considerable time has passed  however incurred claims development in the twelve months ended december  resulted in a small increase in the projected loss ratio for this class of business giving rise to a strengthening of reserves of million 
specialty insurance and reinsurance 
the net reserves of the specialty segment as at december  were million  largely derived through the wellington quota share arrangements 
premium and claims information received from the cedent during the twelve months ended december  enabled the company to refine its accident year assessment 
further information received concerning the development of reserves acquired on the acquisition of city fire now renamed aspen re has also contributed to the overall release in reserves of million 
property and casualty insurance 
the net reserves of the commercial property line of business as at december  were million 
better than expected development in incurred claims during and the short tail nature of this class of business has enabled us to refine our accident year assessment 
this has given rise to a release in net reserves of million 
the net reserves of the commercial liability line of business as at december   were million 
during  development of incurred claims has been slower than previously expected resulting in a reduction in the projected loss ratio suggested by the actuarial projection at december  this has resulted in a release in net reserves of million in the period 
other than the matters described above  we did not make any significant changes in assumptions used in our reserving process 
however  because the period of time we have been in operation is relatively short  our loss experience is limited and reliable evidence of changes in trends of numbers of claims incurred  average settlement amounts  numbers of claims outstanding and average losses per claim will necessarily take years to develop 
capital management during we began a new phase of capital management which is intended to better manage both the total amount and funding of the capital deployed in our business 
while total capital increased during the year the proportion funded by our ordinary shareholders has decreased from to 
this was achieved through a repurchase of shares using the proceeds of the issuance of a new class of preference shares 
the following table shows our capital structure at december  compared to december

management monitors the ratio of debt to total capital  with total capital being defined as shareholders equity plus outstanding debt 
at december   this ratio was   
our preference shares are classified in our balance sheet as equity but may receive a different treatment in some cases under the capital adequacy assessments made by certain rating agencies 
such securities are often referred to as hybrids as they have certain attributes of both debt and equity 
we also monitor the ratio of the total of debt and hybrids to total capital and this stands at as of december the principal capital management transactions during were as follows 
issuance of preference shares 
on november   we issued  perpetual non cumulative preference shares  par value each  with liquidation preference of per share previously defined as the perpetual preference shares for an aggregate amount of million 
on november   in connection with the issuance of the perpetual preference shares  the company entered into a replacement capital covenant the replacement capital covenant with respect to the perpetual preference shares initially for the benefit of persons that hold the company s senior notes  that the company will not redeem or repurchase the perpetual preference shares on or before november   unless  during the six months prior to the date of that redemption or repurchase  the company receives a specified amount of proceeds from the sale of ordinary shares  perpetual preference shares and certain other securities that have characteristics that are the same as  or more equity like than  the applicable characteristics of the perpetual preference shares at the time of that redemption or repurchase 
the replacement capital covenant provides a greater equity treatment of the perpetual preference shares by moody s 
repurchases of ordinary shares 
on december   the company entered into an agreement with two of its founding shareholders  the blackstone group and csfb private equity and their respective affiliates  to repurchase a total of  ordinary shares at a price per share of which represented a discount of to the closing price of the company s shares on november  of 
the total purchase price was million 
the purchase price was funded with the proceeds of the sale of the company s perpetual preference shares  which closed on november  the ordinary shares were repurchased and retired on december  on december   the company entered into a master confirmation agreement with goldman  sachs co 
goldman sachs pursuant to which the company agreed to repurchase million of its ordinary shares from goldman sachs in a private transaction in connection with an accelerated stock buyback asb program 
the master confirmation contains the principal terms and provisions governing the asb between the company and goldman sachs 
the shares were repurchased for an upfront payment of million  subject to collar provisions that establish the minimum and maximum numbers of shares to be repurchased by the company 
in connection with the asb  gldman sachs is expected to purchase the amount of shares required to be delivered to the company under the terms of the master confirmation in the open market over time 
the company received and cancelled  the minimum number of shares from goldman sachs on january   based on the rule b volume weighted average price of shares traded during an initial hedging period increased by a pre agreed percentage to establish the cap or maximum price per share payable under the program 
the program is expected to terminate at a date to be selected by goldman sachs between one month and three months after the completion of the hedging period which ended on january  at the end of the program  the company may receive additional shares  if applicable  based on the rule b volume weighted average price of shares traded during the period between january  and the termination date less a discount per share of cents 
the maximum additional number of shares that may be received is  the repurchased shares will be cancelled and retired and the result will be that the average repurchase price will fall between and per share for a total fixed consideration of million 
the two share repurchase transactions represented a total cumulative repurchase amount of approximately million  being part of the million share repurchase program authorized by the company s board of directors as announced on november  the cumulative share repurchase of approximately million was funded materially with the proceeds of the sale of the company s perpetual preference shares 
access to capital 
our business operations are in part dependent on our financial strength and the market s perception thereof  as measured by shareholders equity  which was  million at december   million at december  
we believe our financial strength provides us with the flexibility and capacity to obtain funds through debt or equity financing 
our continuing ability to access the capital markets is dependent on  among other things  our operating results  market conditions and our perceived financial strength 
we continuously monitor our capital and financial position  as well as investment and security market conditions  both in general and with respect to aspen holdings securities 
our ordinary shares and all our preference shares are listed on the new york stock exchange 
under a shelf registration statement filed on october  we have the facility to issue and sell up to approximately million of securities subject to the issuance of one or more supplementary prospectuses and market conditions 
liquidity liquidity is a measure of a company s ability to generate cash flows sufficient to meet short term and long term cash requirements of its business operations 
management monitors the liquidity of aspen holdings and of each of its insurance subsidiaries and arranges credit facilities to enhance short term liquidity resources on a stand by basis 
holding company 
we monitor the ability of aspen holdings to service debt  to finance dividend payments to ordinary and preference shareholders and to provide financial support to the insurance subsidiaries 
as at december  and  aspen holdings held million and million  respectively  in cash and cash equivalents which management considers sufficient to provide us liquidity at such time 
of the funds held at december  million was subsequently applied to provide additional capital funding to aspen re 
holding company liquidity depends on dividends  capital distributions and interest payments from our insurance subsidiaries 
in  aspen uk holdings paid us a dividend of million million 
no other dividends were paid to us in or we also received interest of million million from aspen uk holdings in respect of an intercompany loan 
the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay us dividends or other distributions is subject to the laws and regulations applicable to each jurisdiction  as well as the insurance subsidiaries need to maintain capital requirements adequate to maintain their insurance and reinsurance operations and their financial strength ratings issued by independent rating agencies 
for a discussion of the various restrictions on our ability and our insurance subsidiaries ability to pay dividends  see business regulatory matters in part i  item in this report 
there were no significant restrictions on the ability of aspen re and aspen bermuda to pay us dividends funded from their respective accumulated balances of retained income as at december  in addition to its dividend capacity as at december   aspen bermuda could also make capital repayments to aspen holdings in excess of million without prior approval from the bermuda monetary authority 
aspen re has million available for capital repayments to aspen uk holdings which could in turn be used to fund repayments of loans made by aspen holdings to aspen uk holdings 
even though not strictly required  aspen re would typically seek fsa approval prior to making such capital repayment 
for a more detailed discussion of our insurance subsidiaries ability to pay dividends  see note of our financial statements 
insurance subsidiaries 
as of december   the insurance subsidiaries held approximately  million  million in cash and short term investments that are readily realizable securities 
management monitors the value  currency and duration of cash and investments held by its insurance subsidiaries to ensure that they are able to meet their insurance and other liabilities as they become due and was satisfied that there was a comfortable margin of liquidity as at december  and for the foreseeable future 
on an ongoing basis  our insurance subsidiaries sources of funds primarily consist of premiums written  investment income and proceeds from sales and redemptions of investments 
cash is used primarily to pay reinsurance premiums  losses and loss adjustment expenses  brokerage commissions  general and administrative expenses  taxes  interest and dividends and to purchase new investments 
the potential for individual large claims and for accumulations of claims from single events means that substantial and unpredictable payments may need to be made within relatively short periods of time 
we manage these risks by making regular forecasts of the timing and amount of expected cash outflows and ensuring that we maintain sufficient balances in cash and short term investments to meet these estimates 
notwithstanding this policy  if our cash flow forecast is incorrect  we could be forced to liquidate investments prior to maturity  potentially at a significant loss 
the liquidity of our insurance subsidiaries is also affected by the terms of our contractual obligations to u 
s policyholders and by undertakings to certain regulatory authorities to facilitate the issue of letters of credit or maintain certain balances in trust funds for the benefit of policyholders

in estimating the time intervals into which payments of our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses fall  as set out above  we have utilized actuarially assessed payment patterns 
by the nature of the insurance and reinsurance contracts under which these liabilities are assumed  there can be no certainty that actual payments will fall in the periods shown and there could be a material acceleration or deceleration of claims payments depending on factors outside our control 
this uncertainty is heightened by the short time in which we have operated  thereby providing limited company specific claims loss payment patterns 
the total amount of payments in respect of our reserves  as well as the timing of such payments  may differ materially from our current estimates for the reasons set out above under critical accounting policies reserves for losses and loss expenses 
we have entered into a lease for three floors comprising a total of approximately  square feet in hamilton  bermuda for our holding company and bermuda operations 
the term of the rental lease agreement is for six years  and we have agreed to pay approximately a total of million per year in rent for the three floors for the first three years and annual service charges of  per year 
we moved into these new premises on january  on april   aspen re signed an agreement for underleases for office space in london of approximately a total of  square feet covering three floors 
the term of each lease for each floor commenced in november and runs for years 
service charges of approximately million per annum are payable from this date  and are subject to increase 
we will begin paying the yearly basic rent of approximately million per annum in november the basic annual rent for each of the leases will each be subject to yearly upwards only rent reviews 
there are no contractual provisions in any of the leases allowing us to terminate any of the leases prior to expiration of the year contractual terms 
in  we moved offices in boston and entered into a new lease for office space totalling approximately  square feet covering two floors of the federal reserve bank building in boston  massachusetts 
the commencement date of the lease was september  the lease term is for ten years  with the annual rent for the first five years being approximately million and for the remainder of the term being approximately million 
in addition  we lease office space in marlton  new jersey and rocky hill  connecticut as well as other states in the united states in connection with our us operations 
we also lease office space in paris  france 
we believe that our office space is sufficient for us to conduct our operations for the foreseeable future 
for a discussion of derivative instruments we have entered into  please see note to our audited financial statements for the twelve months ended december  included elsewhere in this report 
off balance sheet arrangements we are not party to any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an affiliated entity unconsolidated with us is a party that management believes is reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that we are principally exposed to four types of market risk interest rate risk  equity risk  foreign currency risk and credit risk 
interest rate risk 
our investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed income securities 
accordingly  our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates 
fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these securities 
as interest rates rise  the market value of our fixed income portfolio falls  and the converse is also true 
we expect to manage interest rate risk by selecting investments with characteristics such as duration  yield  currency and liquidity taking into account the anticipated cash outflow characteristics of aspen re s  aspen bermuda s and aspen specialty s insurance and reinsurance liabilities 
our strategy for managing interest rate risk also includes maintaining a high quality portfolio with a relatively short duration to reduce the effect of interest rate changes on book value 
the portfolio is actively managed and trades are made to balance our exposure to interest rates 
as at december   our fixed income portfolio had an approximate duration of years 
the table below depicts interest rate change scenarios and the effect on our interest rate sensitive invested assets

equity risk 
we have invested in two funds of hedge funds which total in value million at december   equivalent to of the total of our investments  cash and cash equivalents at that date 
these funds of hedge funds are structured to have low volatility and limited correlation with traditional fixed income markets 
the underlying assets comprise of hedge funds with diverse strategies and securities 
to the extent that the underlying hedge funds have equity positions and are market neutral  we are exposed to losses from changes in prices of those positions and to the extent that they have net long or net short equity positions  we are exposed to losses that are more correlated to changes in equity markets in general 
foreign currency risk 
our reporting currency is the us dollar 
the functional currencies of our segments are us dollars and british pounds 
as of december   approximately of our cash and investments was held in us dollars  approximately were in british pounds and approximately were in currencies other than the us dollar and the british pound 
for the twelve months ended december   of our gross premiums were written in currencies other than the us dollar and the british pound and we expect that a similar proportion will be written in currencies other than the us dollar and the british pound in other foreign currency amounts are remeasured to the appropriate functional currency and the resulting foreign exchange gains or losses are reflected in the statement of operations 
functional currency amounts of assets and liabilities are then translated into us dollars 
the unrealized gain or loss from this translation  net of tax  is recorded as part of ordinary shareholders equity 
the change in unrealized foreign currency translation gain or loss during the year  net of tax  is a component of comprehensive income 
both the remeasurement and translation are calculated using current exchange rates for the balance sheets and average exchange rates for the statement of operations 
we may experience exchange losses to the extent our foreign currency exposure is not properly managed or otherwise hedged  which in turn would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
management estimates that a change in the exchange rate between british pounds and us dollars as at december   would have impacted reported net comprehensive income by approximately million million 
we will continue to manage our foreign currency risk by seeking to match our liabilities under insurance and reinsurance policies that are payable in foreign currencies with investments that are denominated in these currencies 
this may involve the use of forward exchange contracts from time to time 
a forward foreign currency exchange contract involves an obligation to purchase or sell a specified currency at a future date at a price set at the time of the contract 
foreign currency exchange contracts will not eliminate fluctuations in the value of our assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but rather allow us to establish a rate of exchange for a future point in time 
all realized gains and losses and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts are recognized in the statement of operations 
there were no outstanding forward contracts as at december  or credit risk 
we have exposure to credit risk primarily as a holder of fixed income securities 
our risk management strategy and investment policy is to invest in debt instruments of high credit quality issuers and to limit the amount of credit exposure with respect to particular ratings categories  business sectors and any one issuer 
as at december  and  the average rate of fixed income securities in our investment portfolio was aaa 
in addition  we are exposed to the credit risk of our insurance and reinsurance brokers to whom we make claims payments for our policyholders  as well as to the credit risk of our reinsurers and retrocessionaires who assume business from us 
other than fully collateralized reinsurance the substantial majority of our reinsurers have a rating of a excellent  the third highest of fifteen rating levels  or better by am best and the minimum rating of any of our material reinsurers is a excellent  the fourth highest of fifteen rating levels  by am best 
we have also entered into a credit insurance contract which  subject to its terms  insures the company against losses due to the inability of one or more of our reinsurance counterparties to meet their financial obligations to the company 
payments are made on a quarterly basis throughout the period of the contract based on the aggregate limit  which was set initially at million but is subject to adjustment 
the table below shows our reinsurance recoverables as of december   and our reinsurers ratings taking into account any changes in ratings as of february

effects of inflation inflation may have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations by its effect on interest rates and on the cost of settling claims 
the potential exists  after a catastrophe loss  for the development of inflationary pressures in a local economy as the demand for services such as construction typically surges 
we believe this has had and will continue to have a significant impact on the cost of claims arising from the and hurricanes and we have sought to take this into account when setting reserves for these events 
our calculation of reserves for losses and loss expenses in respect of casualty business includes assumptions about future payments for settlement of claims and claims handling expenses  such as medical treatments and litigation costs 
we write liability business in the united states  the united kingdom and australia  where claims inflation has grown particularly strong in recent years 
to the extent inflation causes these costs to increase above reserves established for these claims  we will be required to increase our loss reserves with a corresponding reduction in retained earnings 
the actual effects of inflation on our results cannot be accurately known until claims are ultimately settled 
in addition to general price inflation we are exposed to a persisting long term upwards trend in the cost of judicial awards for damages 
we take this into account in our pricing and reserving of casualty business
