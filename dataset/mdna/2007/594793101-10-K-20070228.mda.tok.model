item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview micrel designs  develops  manufactures and markets a range of high performance analog power ics  mixed signal and digital ics 
these products address a wide range of end markets including cellular handsets  enterprise and portable computing  enterprise and home networking  wide area and metropolitan area networks and industrial equipment 
the company also manufactures custom analog and mixed signal circuits and provides wafer foundry services for customers who produce electronic systems for communications  consumer and military applications 
to enhance the readers understanding of the company s performance  the following chronological overview of the company s results for the years through have been provided 
the company s revenues grew to the highest level since  increasing percent over the increase in customer demand in the first half of caused lead times for semiconductor components  including micrel s  to expand as customers and distributors became concerned about availability of supply 
the company s revenues continued to grow in the first half of the year and gross margin  operating margin and net income increased on a sequential basis in both the first and second quarters 
by the end of the second quarter  customers began to perceive that the supply of semiconductor components was generally sufficient and lead times for certain components began to shrink 
in the third and fourth quarter of  demand was below normal seasonal levels as customers reacted quickly to uncertain demand for their products  decreasing semiconductor lead times and uncertain economic conditions by reducing their order rates 
customers in certain end markets such as networking  enterprise computing and high speed communications experienced lower demand for their end products than they had anticipated 
this factor  combined with rapidly shrinking lead times from most semiconductor suppliers  led to lower order rates for the company s products in the second half of as customers attempted to control their inventory levels 
the company s level of on hand inventory remained above prior year levels to provide a high level of customer service in response to shorter customer lead times 
as a result of lower order rates  the company s backlog and revenues declined in both the third and fourth quarter of despite the decline in customer demand and revenue in the second half of  the company s continued focus on manufacturing cost reductions resulted in an eight percentage point increase in gross margin from in to in in the first quarter of  demand as measured by order rates  improved substantially over fourth quarter of levels 
first quarter bookings increased by over fourth quarter levels 
the improvement in order rates was driven by customers serving the industrial  computing and communications end markets 
bookings from micrel s major distributors increased in the first quarter after falling sharply in the second half of as distributors adjusted to shorter industry lead times and reduced their inventory levels 
despite increased bookings during the first quarter and lean supply chain inventory levels  order lead times from micrel s customers continued to average two to three weeks 
in the second quarter of  the ongoing short lead time environment continued to cause customers to order only what was required for their short term needs 
second quarter order rates declined from first quarter levels primarily due to lower order amounts from the company s distributors and certain customers serving the wireless handset end market 
bookings from the company s major sell through distributors declined from strong first quarter levels and were less than overall resales for the second quarter as distributors attempted to increase their inventory turns to improve their management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued return on working capital 
in the wireless handset market  customers reduced both orders and production levels in coordination with efforts to reduce channel inventories of handsets 
second quarter net revenues of million increased sequentially by  but were less than the net revenues of the year ago period 
the company continued to exercise pricing discipline for most of its products in an attempt to improve gross profit 
consequently  sales of certain products  such as those serving the soho ethernet market and the low end personal computer market  declined resulting in a lower rate of revenue growth for the company 
third quarter order rates increased substantially from second quarter levels  increasing sequentially in all geographic regions 
throughout the third quarter  customers continued to place orders with short delivery requirements  even as the aggregate order level increased 
order levels from the company s distributors increased in the third quarter  returning to a level consistent with sales of micrel s products to their end customers 
third quarter net revenues increased sequentially by to million  but were below the revenue level of the year ago period 
continued broad based demand  combined with lean channel inventories and short lead times  resulted in higher order rates for the company in the fourth quarter of order strength in the quarter from customers serving the industrial and communications end markets  and from the company s major distributors  resulted in the second highest quarterly booking level since calendar year net revenues increased on a sequential basis in the fourth quarter to million and were above the net revenues in the year ago period 
although order rates increased in the fourth quarter  customer lead times remained short  averaging three to four weeks 
in  the company s gross margin improved continuously throughout the year  returning to levels recorded in the year despite significantly lower levels of revenue and capacity utilization 
the increase in gross margin was in part  due to better pricing discipline  improved sales mix of higher margin products  ongoing manufacturing cost reductions and lower depreciation expense as a result of disciplined capital spending 
in the first quarter of  broad based strength in customer demand  combined with continued lean channel inventories resulted in the highest quarterly booking level for micrel since calendar year orders from customers serving the communications and industrial end markets strengthened in the first quarter 
bookings from micrel s major sell through distributors also increased sequentially in the first quarter 
increased end customer demand led these distributors to extend their order backlog with micrel during the quarter 
this resulted in a distributor book to bill substantially above one as our distributors attempted to increase their inventories and ensure availability of supply for the second quarter of bookings from our direct oem customers and sell in stocking representatives also increased on a sequential basis  despite typical seasonal slowness in the handset and personal computing end markets 
net revenues increased on a sequential basis to million and were above the net revenues of the year ago period 
the sequential growth in net revenues was primarily the result of increased demand from customers serving the wireline communications end market and higher resales of the company s products through its distributors 
the first quarter strength in sales to the communications and industrial end markets was partially offset by seasonal declines in sales to the wireless handset primarily in korea and computing end markets 
in the first quarter of  the company recorded the highest quarterly gross margin as of that time in its history 
the first quarter gross margin of exceeded the previous peak gross margins recorded in the year  when revenue levels were substantially higher 
the sequential improvement in gross margin was primarily the result of a richer sales mix driven by increased sales of higher margin wireline communications products 
despite an increase of million in equity based compensation expense as a result of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the adoption of sfas no 
r  the company s operating profit increased on both a sequential and year over year basis 
operating margin improved to of net revenues in the first quarter of from in the fourth quarter of and in the year ago period 
the company s inventory increased on a sequential basis in response to higher demand and in order to provide competitive lead times to our customers 
the sequential increase in inventory added approximately one percentage point to first quarter gross margin  about the same as that experienced in the fourth quarter of in the second quarter of  overall order rates moderated from the levels experienced in the first quarter 
orders from the company s sell through distributors declined in the second quarter of as compared to levels in the first quarter of orders from direct oem customers in the second quarter increased sequentially in both north america and europe  while bookings from asia based oem s decreased from the first quarter of  primarily due to lower demand from customers serving the computing and handset end markets 
second quarter net revenues of million increased by sequentially and were above the prior year period 
the growth in net revenues continued to be led by demand from customers serving the wireline communications end market 
this growth was partially offset by continued weakness in demand from korean based customers serving the wireless handset end market as they experienced a sequential decline in handset shipments during the second quarter 
second quarter gross margin of declined by percentage points as compared to the first quarter of but was up percentage points from the reported for the comparable period in the sequential decline in gross margin was primarily the result of normal fluctuations in sales mix and changes in inventory combined with a greater unfavorable impact from stock compensation expense 
operating margin of was flat on a sequential basis and up from in the second quarter of operating income for the second quarters of and includes  and million  respectively  in accrued litigation expense see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s on hand inventories increased by million on a sequential basis 
the majority of the second quarter inventory growth was for purchased ethernet product materials driven by increased customer demand coupled with long rd party foundry cycle times 
micrel s channel inventories at both asia based stocking representatives and sell through distributors increased on a sequential basis in the second quarter 
resales of the company s products through the distribution channel increased by approximately in the second quarter of  while sales through asian based stocking representatives were roughly flat in the second quarter 
overall inventory turns for micrel s sell through distributors and asian based stocking representatives remained within historical average levels at the end of the second quarter of in the third quarter of  overall order rates declined on a sequential basis  primarily because the company s sell through distributors reduced orders and consumed backlog in an attempt to control inventory levels 
orders from direct oem customers increased slightly on a sequential basis in the third quarter primarily due to higher bookings from customers serving the wireless handset and computing end markets  and increased foundry orders 
third quarter net revenues of million increased by sequentially and were above the prior year period 
continued strength from the industrial end market  combined with a rebound in the company s wireless handset business  led the product revenue growth in the third quarter 
third quarter resales of the company s products through the distribution channel increased slightly in what is traditionally a seasonally slow period for north american and european distributors 
sales to the wireline communications markets slowed in the quarter after rapid growth in the first half of third quarter net revenues included million associated with a patent license that was previously under litigation 
third quarter gross margin of matched the highest level in the company s history 
operating profit was million and operating margin improved to of sales 
the settlement of intellectual property matters  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued and related licensing revenues and expenses  resulted in million of net pre tax operating income in the third quarter  increasing third quarter net income by per diluted share 
the company s september ending on hand inventory increased million from the second quarter 
the majority of the inventory growth was for purchased material for ethernet products  as manufacturing cycle times at the foundries that manufacture ethernet products declined during the third quarter while end demand for certain ethernet products decreased 
channel inventories at micrel s asia based stocking representatives remained flat from the end of the second quarter  while channel inventories at the company s sell through distributors decreased on a sequential basis after growing in the previous three quarters 
during the fourth quarter of customers reduced inventory levels  which we believe was caused by uncertain demand for their end products and the perception that semiconductor components were readily available 
order rates were slightly lower than the third quarter  and remained below the level of fourth quarter revenues 
bookings from the company s sell through distributors rebounded during the fourth quarter  which we believe indicates that distributors inventories are in balance with end demand 
fourth quarter net revenues were million  a decrease of from third quarter revenues of million and lower than revenues of million recorded in the year ago period 
the sequential decline in sales resulted primarily from reduced demand from wireless handset manufacturers combined with lower distribution revenues and the absence of patent license revenue 
gross margin of declined from the previous quarter primarily due to lower revenues and the impact of reduced manufacturing volumes leading to less absorption of fixed cost 
fourth quarter operating profit was million or of sales 
the company s inventory was flat on a sequential basis as the company reduced manufacturing activity in response to reduced demand 
channel inventories also remained roughly flat from third quarter levels 
micrel s overall financial performance in was one of the best on an annual basis in the company s history 
revenues of million were the second highest annual amount ever recorded 
total sales increased by over the million posted in gross margin of improved for the fourth consecutive year and reached the highest level in the company s history  exceeding previous peak levels recorded in the year when revenues were higher than income from operations of million increased by from the million recorded in operating margin improved to from in year marked the th year out of micrel s year history that the company was profitable 
year net income was million  or per diluted share  an increase of from million  or per diluted share in year net income and earnings per share were the second highest ever recorded by micrel on an annual basis 
operating cash flow for the year of was million 
as of december   the company maintained cash and short term investment balances of million 
in  micrel acquired bluechip communications as bluechip of oslo  norway 
bluechip is a fabless semiconductor company that designs  develops and markets high performance rf ics and modules for the actuation and connectivity markets 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase under sfas business combinations and  accordingly  the results of operations of bluechip from the date of acquisition forward have been included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company derives a substantial portion of its net revenues from standard products 
for  and the company s standard products sales accounted for   and  respectively  of the company s net revenues 
the company believes that a substantial portion of its net revenues in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued future will depend upon standard products sales  although such sales as a proportion of net revenues may vary as the company adjusts product output levels to correspond with varying economic conditions and demand levels in the markets which it serves 
the standard products business is characterized by short term orders and shipment schedules  and customer orders typically can be canceled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer 
since most standard products backlog is cancelable without significant penalty  the company typically plans its production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which is highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
in addition  the company is limited in its ability to reduce costs quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
the company may experience significant fluctuations in its results of operations 
factors that affect the company s results of operations include the volume and timing of orders received  changes in the mix of products sold  the utilization level of manufacturing capacity  competitive pricing pressures and the successful development of new products 
these and other factors are described in further detail later in this discussion and in item a 
as a result of the foregoing or other factors  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis  which could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies and estimates the financial statements included in this form k and discussed within this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
for a detailed discussion of the company s significant accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company considers certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  share based accounting  income taxes  and litigation to be critical to the fair presentation of its financial statements 
revenue recognition and receivables 
micrel generates revenue by selling products to oem s  distributors and stocking representatives 
stocking representative firms may buy and stock the company s products for resale or may act as the company s sales representative in arranging for direct sales from the company to an oem customer 
the company s policy is to recognize revenue from sales to customers when the rights and risks of ownership have passed to the customer  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
micrel allows certain distributors  primarily located in north america and europe  and in certain countries in asia  significant return rights  price protection and pricing adjustments subsequent to the initial product shipment 
as these returns and price concessions have historically been significant  and future returns and price concessions are difficult to reliably estimate  the company defers recognition of revenue and related cost of sales in the balance sheet line item deferred income on shipments to distributors derived from sales to these distributors until they have resold the company s products to their customers 
although revenue recognition and related cost of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued sales are deferred  the company records an accounts receivable and relieves inventory at the time of initial product shipment 
as standard terms are fob shipping point  payment terms are enforced from shipment date and legal title and risk of inventory loss passes to the distributor upon shipment 
in addition  where revenue is deferred upon shipment and recognized on a sell through basis  the company may offer price adjustments to its distributors to allow the distributor to price the company s products competitively for specific resale opportunities 
the company estimates and records an allowance for distributor price adjustments for which the specific resale transaction has been completed  but the price adjustment claim has not yet been received and recorded by the company 
sales to oem customers and asian based stocking representatives are recognized based upon the shipment terms of the sale transaction when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
the company does not grant return rights  price protection or pricing adjustments to oem customers 
the company offers limited contractual stock rotation rights to stocking representatives 
in addition  the company is not contractually obligated to offer  but may infrequently grant  price adjustments or price protection to certain stocking representatives on an exception basis 
at the time of shipment to oems and stocking representatives  an allowance for returns is established based upon historical return rates  and an allowance for price adjustments is established based on an estimate of price adjustments to be granted 
actual future returns and price adjustments could be different than the allowance established 
the company also maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable 
this estimate is based on an analysis of specific customer creditworthiness and historical bad debts experience 
actual future uncollectible amounts could exceed the doubtful accounts allowance established 
inventory valuation 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
the company records adjustments to write down the cost of obsolete and excess inventory to the estimated market value based on historical and forecasted demand for its products 
if actual future demand for the company s products is less than currently forecasted  additional inventory adjustments may be required 
once an inventory write down provision is established  it is maintained until the product to which it relates is sold or otherwise disposed of 
this treatment is in accordance with accounting research bulletin and sec staff accounting bulletin restructuring and impairment charges 
share based compensation 
prior to fiscal  the company accounted for share based compensation plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of apb opinion no 
effective january   micrel adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method 
under sfas no 
r share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense in the statement of operations 
to determine fair value  the company uses the black scholes valuation model which requires input factors such as expected term  stock price volatility  dividend rate and risk free interest rate 
in addition  sfas no 
r requires an estimate of expected forfeiture rates of stock grants and share based compensation expense is to be only recognized for those shares expected to vest 
determining the input factors  such as expected term  expected volatility and estimated forfeiture rates  requires significant judgment based on subjective future expectations 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities result primarily from temporary timing differences between book and tax valuation of assets and liabilities  and state research and development credit carryforwards 
the company must regularly assess the likelihood that future taxable income levels will be sufficient to ultimately realize the tax benefits of these deferred tax assets 
as of december   the company believes that future taxable income levels will be sufficient to realize the tax benefits of these deferred tax assets and has not established a valuation allowance 
should the company determine that future realization of these tax benefits is not more likely than not  a valuation allowance would be established  which would increase the company s tax provision in the period of such determination 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in addition  the calculation of the company s tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
the company records liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on its estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes may be due 
actual tax liabilities may be different than the recorded estimates and could result in an additional charge or benefit to the tax provision in the period when the ultimate tax assessment is determined 
litigation 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
the company has recently settled cases involving intellectual property claims see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
an estimated liability is accrued when it is determined to be probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
the liability accrual is charged to income in the period such determination is made 
the company regularly evaluates current information available to determine whether such accruals should be made

net revenues 
net revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million in due to increased standard product revenues and increased other products revenues 
standard product revenues increased to million  which represented of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to million and of net revenues for these increases resulted primarily from increased shipments of standard products to the industrial  networking and high speed communications end markets 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued other products revenues which consist primarily of custom and foundry products revenues and revenues from the license of patents  increased to million  which represented of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to million and of net revenues for these increases partially resulted from a million patent license included in combined with increased shipments of foundry and custom products 
for the year ended december   net revenues decreased to million from million in due to decreased standard product revenues 
standard product revenues decreased to million  which represented of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to million and of net revenues for these decreases resulted primarily from decreased unit shipments of standard products to the high speed communications and networking end markets 
other product revenues increased to million  which represented of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to million and of net revenues for customer demand for semiconductors can change quickly and unexpectedly 
the company s revenue levels have been highly dependent on the amount of new orders that are received for which product is requested to be delivered to the customer within the same quarter 
within the semiconductor industry these orders that are booked and shipped within the quarter are called turns fill orders 
when the turns fill level exceeds approximately of quarterly revenue  it makes it very difficult to predict near term revenues and income 
because of the long cycle time to build its products  the company s lack of visibility into demand when turns fill is high makes it difficult to predict what product to build to match future demand 
during  the company averaged approximately to turns fill per quarter compared to approximately to turns fill per quarter during as noted in item a risk factors and in the overview section of this item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  a secular trend has developed over the last five years whereby customers in the semiconductor supply chain have worked to minimize the amount of inventory of semiconductors they hold 
as a consequence  customers are generally providing less order backlog to the company and other semiconductor suppliers  and relying on short lead times to buffer their build schedules 
shorter lead times reduce visibility into end demand and increase the reliance on turns fill orders 
to deal with these market forces while maintaining reliable service levels  the company and other semiconductor suppliers are carrying higher relative levels of inventory compared with historical averages prior to the reluctance of customers to provide order backlog together with short lead times and the uncertain growth rate of the world economy  make it difficult to precisely predict future levels of sales and profitability 
international sales represented   and of net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
on a dollar basis  international sales increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in these increases resulted primarily from increased shipments of high speed communications products primarily in europe 
the trend for the company s customers to move their electronics manufacturing to asian countries has brought increased pricing pressure for micrel and other semiconductor manufacturers 
asian based manufacturers are typically more concerned about cost and less concerned about the capability of the integrated circuits they purchase 
this can make it more difficult for united states based companies to differentiate themselves except by price 
the increased concentration of electronics procurement and manufacturing in the asia pacific region has led  and may continue to lead  to continued price pressure for the company s products in the future 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued share based compensation 
effective january   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method and therefore has not restated results for prior periods 
the company s results of operations for the year ended december  were impacted by the recognition of non cash expense related to the fair value of share based compensation awards 
during  micrel recorded million in pre tax share based compensation expense  of which million is included in cost of revenues  million is included in research and development expense and million is included in sales  general and administrative expense 
prior to january   the company accounted for share based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
during the years through december  certain of the company s option pricing practices resulted in stock compensation expense under apb no 
in addition  the company assumed certain stock options granted to employees of kendin communications in connection with the acquisition of kendin communications in which were compensatory under apb no 
for the years ended december  and  total amortization of deferred stock compensation was  and million  respectively 
gross profit 
gross profit is affected by a variety of factors including the volume of product sales  product mix  manufacturing capacity utilization  product yields and average selling prices 
the company s gross margin increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increases in gross margin resulted primarily from a greater sales mix of higher margin products combined with decreased depreciation  decreased wafer fabrication costs and decreased external assembly and test costs  which were partially offset by increased share based compensation costs due to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
depreciation and amortization as a percent of sales declined to for the year ended december  as compared to for this reduction in depreciation was primarily due to existing equipment becoming fully depreciated  which was partially offset by additional depreciation on new equipment purchases 
in addition  included in gross profit for the year ended december  is million in net revenues for a patent license see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  which is partially offset by a  charge to cost of revenues related to the settlement of a patent dispute see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended december   the company s gross margin increased to from for the year ended december  the increase in gross margin resulted primarily from a greater sales mix of higher margin products combined with decreased depreciation  decreased wafer fabrication costs and decreased external assembly and test costs 
in addition  gross profit for the year ended december  includes the reversal of million of accrued payroll tax liabilities  recorded in the second quarter of  associated with the conclusion of a tax audit see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of deferred stock compensation as a percent of sales declined to for the year ended december  from for the same period in research and development expenses 
research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenues represented and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
on a dollar basis  research and development expenses increased million or to million for the year ended december  from million in these increases were primarily due to increased share based compensation costs due to the adoption of sfas no 
r combined with increased prototype fabrication costs 
the company believes that the development and introduction of new products is critical to its future success and expects to continue its investment in research and development activities in the future 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued for the year ended december   research and development expenses increased million or to million from million in this increase was primarily due to increased prototype fabrication costs combined with increased staffing costs  which was partially offset by decreased depreciation costs 
in addition  included a benefit of million from the reversal of accrued payroll tax liabilities associated with the conclusion of a tax audit see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses represented for both of the years ended december  and on a dollar basis  selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in these increases were primarily due to increased share based compensation costs due to the adoption of sfas no 
r and increased staffing costs  including salaries and sales commissions  which were partially offset by decreased outside legal costs 
for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or to million from million for the comparable period in the increase was principally attributable to increased outside legal costs  primarily associated with litigation activity  combined with increased staffing costs 
in addition  included a benefit of million from the reversal of accrued payroll tax liabilities associated with the conclusion of a tax audit 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
purchased in process technology 
in  micrel acquired of the outstanding common stock and options to purchase common stock of bluechip  in a cash for stock transaction 
micrel paid approximately million in cash and incurred approximately  in direct acquisition costs for the outstanding bluechip securities and options 
the purchase cost allocation  as adjusted for the final determination of certain contingent consideration  resulted in million of the purchase cost allocated to intangible assets 
of that amount   was expensed during the year ended december  to purchased in process technology  which had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future 
the remaining million in intangible assets are included in intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives of three to five years see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
restructuring expense 
in september  the company approved a plan to close its santa clara  california wafer fabrication facility to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies 
during  the company ceased all manufacturing processes within the santa clara facility and completed the relocation of all employees to its san jose  ca facilities 
as of december   the remaining restructuring accrual related to this facility closure was million see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and is classified as other current liabilities 
actual future costs may be different than these estimates and would require an adjustment to restructuring expense in the period such determination is made 
other operating expense 
other operating expenses in consist primarily of accrued costs related to the settlement of patent infringement lawsuits see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
during the year ended december   the company recorded million in other operating expense related to a jury verdict against micrel in its suit against trw automotive and for trw automotive in its countersuit against micrel 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued other income  net 
other income  net reflects interest income from investments in short term investment securities and money market funds and other non operating income  offset by interest expense incurred on term notes and accrued interest related to accrued litigation liabilities 
other income  net increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in these increases were primarily due to an increase in average interest rates and returns on investment balances  which was partially offset by increased accrued interest expense related to accrued litigation liabilities 
for the year ended december  other income  net increased by million to million from million in the increase was primarily due to an increase in the average interest rate earned on investment of cash and short term investment balances 
provision for income taxes 
for the year ended december   the provision for income taxes was million or of income before taxes as compared to million or of income before taxes for the comparable period in the tax rate increase is due primarily to the effects of nondeductible share based compensation expense combined with a reduced impact of federal qualified production activity deductions and federal and state research and development credits due to significantly increased income before tax in the provision for income taxes differs from taxes computed at the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of nondeductible share based compensation expense  state income taxes  state research and development credits  and federal qualified production activity deductions 
for the year ended december   the provision for income taxes was million or of income before taxes 
the income tax provision for was based on the company s estimated annual statutory tax rate of of pretax income  reduced by a million reversal of accrued income tax liabilities in the second quarter of  as a result of the completion of a federal income tax audit see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  the company s principal sources of funding have been its cash from operations  bank borrowings and sales of common stock 
principal sources of liquidity at december   consisted of cash and short term investments of million and a million revolving line of credit from a commercial bank under which the company could borrow million see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
associated with the acquisition of bluechip  the company has  outstanding in term notes payable to the norwegian industrial and regional development fund 
the company generated million in cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december   which was primarily attributable to net income after adding back non cash activities of million consisting primarily of million in depreciation and amortization and million in share based compensation combined with a million decrease in accounts receivable and a million increase in deferred income on shipments to distributors  which were partially offset by million increase in inventories  a million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets combined with a million decrease in income taxes payable and a million decrease in accounts payable 
for the year ended december   cash flows provided by operating activities of million were primarily attributable to net income after adding back non cash activities of million consisting primarily of million in depreciation offset in part by a million increase in deferred management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued income taxes combined with a million decrease in inventories  a million increase in accounts payable  a million increase in other accrued liabilities and a million increase in accrued compensation  which were partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivables 
the company generated million of cash from investing activities during the year ended december   which was primarily comprised of million from the net proceeds from the sale of short term investments  which was partially offset by million in purchases of property  plant and equipment  million in purchases of intangible assets and million increase in restricted cash see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended december   the company used cash of million in investing activities comprised of million in purchases of property  plant and equipment  which was partially offset by net proceeds of  from the sale of short term investments 
the company used million of cash in financing activities during the ended december   primarily for the repurchase of million of the company s common stock  which was partially offset by million in proceeds from employee stock transactions 
cash used by financing activities during the year ended december  of million was the result of million used to repurchase  shares of common stock which was partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock through employee stock transactions of million 
the company currently intends to spend approximately million to million to purchase capital equipment and make facility improvements during the next twelve months primarily for manufacturing equipment for wafer fabrication and product testing and additional research and development related software and equipment 
the company is currently authorized by its board of directors to repurchase an additional million of its common stock through december  since inception  the company s principal sources of funding have been its cash from operations  bank borrowings and sales of common stock 
the company believes that its cash from operations  existing cash balances and short term investments  and its credit facility will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements for the next twelve months
