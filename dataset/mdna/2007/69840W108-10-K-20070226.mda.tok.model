item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general in fiscal  we adopted a new quarterly fiscal calendar whereby each of our quarters include weeks week  week  and week period progressions in each quarter  rather than our prior quarterly fiscal calendar which had weeks in the first quarter and weeks in the second  third  and fourth quarters week period progressions in each quarter 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for each of the quarters of fiscal year conformed to the quarterly presentation 

table of contents in fiscal year  we changed our fiscal week to end on tuesday rather than saturday  with our fiscal year ending on the last tuesday in december 
this change allowed us to better serve customers by shifting the weekly closing activities to a less busy day of the week 
as a result  our fiscal year ended on december  instead of december  and  therefore  consisted of fifty two and a half weeks rather than the fifty three week year that would have resulted without the calendar change 
these additional three days in fiscal year did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
as a result of this calendar change  the next fifty three week year will occur in fiscal year our fiscal year ended on the last saturday in december for and prior fiscal years and consisted of four week periods  with the first  second  and third quarters ending weeks  weeks  and weeks  respectively  into the fiscal year 
we include in this report information on company  franchisee  and or system wide comparable bakery cafe sales percentages and average weekly sales 
system wide sales is a non gaap financial measure that includes sales from all company owned and franchise operated bakery cafes  as reported by franchisees 
management uses system wide sales information internally in connection with store development decisions  planning  and budgeting analyses 
management believes it is useful in assessing consumer acceptance of our brand and facilitating an understanding of financial performance as our franchisees pay royalties and contribute to advertising pools based on a percentage of their sales 
our revenues are derived from company owned bakery cafe sales  fresh dough sales to franchisees  and franchise royalties and fees 
fresh dough sales to franchisees are primarily the sales of dough products to our franchisees and the sales of tuna and cream cheese to certain franchisees 
franchise royalties and fees include royalty income and fees from franchisees 
the cost of food and paper products  labor  occupancy  and other operating expenses relate primarily to company owned bakery cafe sales 
the fresh dough cost of sales to franchisees relates primarily to the sale of fresh dough products and tuna and cream cheese to franchisees 
general and administrative  depreciation  and pre opening expenses relate to all areas of revenue generation 
on february   we purchased percent of the outstanding stock of paradise bakery caf  inc  which we refer to as paradise  owner and operator of locations including bakery cafes  of which are in the phoenix market  and one commissary  and franchisor of locations including bakery cafes and one commissary  at a transaction value of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for further information with respect to the paradise acquisition

the fiscal results of per diluted share also included a charge of per diluted share related to the acquisition of paradise 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for further information with respect to this charge 
in addition  for the fiscal year ended december   we recognized million in general and administrative expenses related to stock options as a result of our adoption on december  of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment or sfas r  which requires the recognition of the fair value of stock based compensation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for further information on our stock based compensation

both company owned and franchise operated comparable bakery cafe sales exclude closed locations 

table of contents reconciliation of non gaap measurements to gaap results in addition to the results provided in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or gaap throughout this report  we have provided certain non gaap measurements to conform results to the presentation related to our stock option expense and to exclude the impact of a non recurring charge on the results relative to the paradise transaction 
effective december   the beginning of our first quarter of  we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  which required all stock based compensation  including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values 
we adopted this accounting treatment using the modified prospective transition method  as permitted under sfas r  therefore results for prior periods have not been restated 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
accordingly  stock based compensation was included as pro forma disclosure in the financial statement footnotes 
further  we incurred a non recurring charge of per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to the paradise acquisition 
we are providing the table below because management believes it provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations by providing current and prior reported amounts on a comparable basis 
the pro forma net income of million and earnings per share of for the fiscal year ended december   and pro forma net income of million and earnings per share of for the fiscal year ended december  are considered non gaap financial measures under applicable sec rules because they are adjusted to include stock based compensation expense in  and to exclude a non recurring charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal relative to the paradise transaction  which are not included in the directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with gaap 
these non gaap financial measures are not a substitute for the reported gaap measures 
the adjustment for stock based compensation expense and paradise charge had the following effect on reported amounts in thousands  except earnings per share for the fiscal year ended percentage december  december  increase pro forma net income  as reported less stock based compensation expense included in footnote  net of tax net income  as reported pro forma fiscal year ended december  plus paradise non recurring charge  net of tax net income pro forma fiscal year ended december  and december   respectively diluted earnings per share  as reported less stock based compensation expense included in footnote  net of tax diluted earnings per share  as reported pro forma fiscal year ended december  plus paradise non recurring charge  net of tax diluted earnings per share  pro forma fiscal year ended december  and december   respectively shares used in diluted earnings per share calculation results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues our total revenues for the fiscal year ended december  increased to million compared to million for the fiscal year ended december  the growth in total revenues for the fiscal year ended december   as compared to the prior year  was primarily due to the opening of new bakery cafes in company owned and franchise operated as well as increases in system wide comparable bakery cafe sales of for the fiscal year ended december  the system wide average weekly sales per bakery cafe and the related number of operating weeks for the fiscal year ended december  and 
table of contents december  were as follows for the fiscal year ended december  december  percentage increase system wide average weekly sales system wide number of operating weeks average weekly sales is calculated by dividing total net sales by operating weeks 
accordingly  year over year growth reflects sales for all locations  whereas comparable store sales exclude closed locations and are based on sales for bakery cafes that have been in operation and owned for at least months 
in addition  we had an additional three days in the first quarter of as compared to the first quarter of as a result of changing our fiscal week in to end on tuesday rather than saturday 
average weekly sales and comparable bakery cafe sales exclude these three additional days in the first quarter of for comparative purposes 
new stores typically experience an opening honey moon whereby they generate higher average weekly sales during the first to weeks they are open as customers settle in to normal usage patterns from initial trial of the location 
on average the settle in experienced is to from the average weekly sales during the honey moon period 
as a result  year over year growth in average weekly sales is generally lower than the growth in comparable bakery cafe sales 
this results from the relationship of the number of bakery cafes in the honey moon phase  the number of bakery cafes in the settle in phase  and the number of stores in the comparable store base 
bakery cafe sales for the fiscal year ended december  for the company owned bakery cafes increased to million from million for the fiscal year ended december  company owned bakery cafe sales as a percentage of total revenue increased by percentage points for the fiscal year ended december  compared to the fiscal year ended december   primarily as a result of the increase in the number of company owned bakery cafe openings

we expect these bakery cafes to open according to the timetables established in the various adas with franchisees  with the majority opening in the next four to five years 
in  we expect our area developers to open to new franchise operated bakery cafes 
the ada requires a franchisee to develop a specified number of bakery cafes on or before specific dates 
if a franchisee fails to develop bakery cafes on schedule  we have the right to terminate the ada and develop company owned locations or develop locations through new area developers in that market 
we may exercise one or more alternative remedies to address defaults by area developers  including not only development defaults  but also defaults in complying with our operating and brand standards and other covenants under the adas and franchise agreements 
fresh dough facility sales to franchisees increased to million for the fiscal year ended december  from million for the fiscal year ended december  the increase was primarily driven by the increased number of franchise operated bakery cafes opened described previously

critical accounting policies estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions  which we believe to be reasonable  based on the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
variances in the estimates or assumptions used could yield materially different accounting results 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the continued appropriateness of our accounting policies and resulting estimates to make adjustments we consider appropriate under the facts and circumstances 
we have chosen accounting policies we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position  and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner 
we consider the following policies on accounting for revenue recognition  goodwill  self insurance  lease obligations  and stock based compensation to be the most critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because they involve the most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon delivery of product or performance of services as follows 
bakery cafe sales are recorded upon delivery of food and other products to a customer 
in addition  fresh dough sales to franchisees are recorded upon delivery of fresh dough to franchisees 
also  a liability is recorded in the period in which a gift card is issued and proceeds are received 
as gift cards are redeemed  this liability is reduced and revenue is recognized as a sale 
further  franchise fees are the result of sales of area development rights and the sale of individual franchise locations to third parties 
the initial franchise fee is  per bakery cafe to be developed under the area development agreement  or ada 
of this fee   is paid at the time of signing of the ada and is recognized as revenue when it is received as it is non refundable and we have to perform no other service to earn this fee 
the remaining  is paid at the time an individual franchise agreement is signed and is recognized as revenue upon the 
table of contents commencement of franchise operations of the bakery cafes 
royalties are paid weekly based on a percentage of sales  ranging from to  as defined in the agreement 
royalties are recognized as revenue when they are earned 
valuation of goodwill we record goodwill related to the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired 
at december  and december   our goodwill balance was million and million  respectively 
annually  and whenever an event or circumstance indicates it is more likely than not our goodwill has been impaired  management assesses the carrying value of our recorded goodwill 
we perform our impairment assessment by comparing discounted cash flows from reporting units with the carrying value of the underlying net assets inclusive of goodwill 
in performing this analysis  management considers such factors as current results  trends  future prospects and other economic factors 
no event has been identified indicating an impairment in the value of our goodwill 
self insurance we are self insured for a significant portion of our workers compensation  group health beginning in  and general  auto  and property liability insurance for up to million of individual claims  depending on the category of loss 
we also purchase aggregate stop loss and or layers of loss insurance in many categories of loss 
at december  and december   self insurance reserves were million and million  respectively 
we utilize third party actuarial experts estimates of expected losses based on statistical analyses of historical industry data as well as our own estimates based on our actual historical data to determine required self insurance reserves 
these assumptions are closely reviewed  monitored  and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances 
actual experience related to number of claims and cost per claim could be more or less favorable than estimated resulting in expense reduction or increase 
lease obligation we recognize rent expense on a straight line basis over the reasonably assured lease period 
certain of our lease agreements provide for scheduled rent increases during the lease terms or for rental payments commencing at a date other than the date of initial occupancy 
we include any rent escalations and construction and other rent holidays in our straight line rent expense 
in addition  we record landlord allowances for normal tenant improvements as deferred rent  which is included in accrued expenses or deferred rent in the consolidated balance sheets based on their short term or long term nature 
these landlord allowances are amortized over the reasonably assured lease term as a reduction of rent expense 
also  leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight line method over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the related reasonably assured lease term 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our accounting for leases 
stock based compensation we maintain several stock based incentive plans 
we grant options to purchase common stock at an option price equal to the market value of the stock at the date of grant 
options generally vest ratably over a four year period beginning two years from date of grant and have a six year term 
we also grant restricted stock with vesting and terms similar to option grants 
in addition  we offer a stock purchase plan where employees may purchase our common stock each calendar quarter through payroll deductions 
participants in the stock purchase plan may elect to purchase our common stock at percent of market value on the purchase date and we recognize compensation expense on the percent discount 
prior to the effective date of sfas r  we applied apb no 
 and related interpretations  for our stock option grants 
apb no 
provides that the compensation expense relative to our stock options is measured based on the intrinsic value of the stock option at date of grant 
effective the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year  we adopted the provisions of sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this method  prior periods are not restated 
we use the black scholes option pricing model which requires extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates  including estimates of the expected term participants will retain their vested stock options before exercising them  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term  and the number of options that will be forfeited prior to the completion of their vesting requirements 
application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different estimates of the fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amount of stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
the provisions of sfas r apply to new stock options and stock options outstanding  but not yet vested  on the date we adopted sfas r 

table of contents stock based compensation expense recognized during the fiscal year ended december  totaled approximately million related to stock options  million related to restricted stock  and million related to stock purchase plan discounts 
stock based compensation expense was included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
contractual obligations and other commitments we currently anticipate total capital expenditures for fiscal year of approximately million to million  which consists of the following million to million related to the opening of at least new company owned bakery cafes and the costs incurred on early openings  million to million related to the remodeling of existing bakery cafes  million to million related to the opening of new fresh dough facilities and the remodeling and expansion of existing fresh dough facilities  and million to million on our concept  information technology  and infrastructure 
we expect future bakery cafes will require  on average  an investment per bakery cafe excluding pre opening expenses which are expensed as incurred of approximately million  which is net of landlord allowances 
we expect to fund these expenditures principally through internally generated cash flow and cash from the exercise of employee stock options 
in addition to our capital expenditure requirements  we have certain other contractual and committed cash obligations 
our contractual cash obligations consist of certain purchase obligations and noncancelable operating leases for our bakery cafes  fresh dough facilities and trucks  and administrative offices 
lease terms for our trucks are generally for five to seven years 
lease terms for our bakery cafes  fresh dough facilities  and administrative offices are generally for ten years with renewal options at most locations and generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes  insurance  common area  and other operating costs 
many bakery cafe leases provide for contingent rental ie  percentage rent payments based on sales in excess of specified amounts 
certain of our lease agreements provide for scheduled rent increases during the lease terms or for rental payments commencing at a date other than the date of initial occupancy 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our accounting for leases 
we expect cash expenditures under these lease obligations and cash expenditures under our purchase obligations to be as follows payments due by period as of december  in thousands total in after operating leases purchase obligations total see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
relates to certain commodity agreements where we are committed at december  to purchase a fixed quantity at a fixed price over a time period ranging from three months to one year  the majority of which are for a time period up to six months 
off balance sheet arrangement we are the prime tenant for operating leases of franchisee locations and a guarantor for operating leases of locations of our former au bon pain division  or its franchisees 
the leases have terms expiring on various dates from march to december and have a potential amount of future rental payments of approximately million 
the obligation from these leases will continue to decrease over time as these operating leases expire 
as the guarantees were initiated prior to december   we have not recorded a liability for these guarantees pursuant to the provisions of fasb interpretation number fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
also  we have not had to make any payments related to the leases and currently do not anticipate making payments in the future 
au bon pain or the applicable franchisee continues to have primary liability for these operating leases 
potential future commitments consist of potential commitments as of december  in thousands total in after subleases and lease guarantees represents aggregate minimum requirement see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
in november  we signed an agreement with dawn food products  inc to provide sweet goods for the period this agreement was subsequently extended to may the agreement with dawn is structured as a cost plus agreement 

table of contents we have confidential and proprietary information and non competition agreements agreements with certain employees 
these agreements contain a provision whereby employees would be due a certain number of weeks of their salary if their employment was terminated by us as specified in the agreement 
in accordance with sfas  we have not recorded a liability for these amounts potentially due employees 
rather  we will record a liability for these amounts when an amount becomes due to an employee 
as of december   the total amount potentially owed employees under these agreements was approximately million 
our capital requirements  including development costs related to the opening or acquisition of additional bakery cafes and fresh dough facilities and maintenance and remodel expenditures  have and will continue to be significant 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors  including the pace of expansion  real estate markets  site locations  and the nature of the arrangements negotiated with landlords 
we believe that our cash flow from operations and the exercise of employee stock options will be sufficient to fund our capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
impact of inflation in the past  we have been able to recover inflationary cost and commodity price increases  including  among other things  fuel  butter  tuna  and cream cheese costs  through increased menu prices 
there have been  and there may be in the future  delays in implementing such menu price increases  and competitive pressures may limit our ability to recover such cost increases in their entirety 
historically  the effects of inflation on our net income have not been materially adverse 
a majority of our employees are paid hourly rates related to federal and state minimum wage laws 
although we have and will continue to attempt to pass along any increased labor costs through food price increases  there can be no assurance that all such increased labor costs can be reflected in our prices or that increased prices will be absorbed by consumers without diminishing to some degree consumer spending at the bakery cafes 
however  we have not experienced to date a significant reduction in bakery cafe profit margins as a result of changes in such laws  and management does not anticipate any related future significant reductions in gross profit margins

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we manage our commodity risk in several ways 
we periodically enter into swap agreements to manage our fluctuating butter prices 
all derivative instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes 
as of december   we did not have any derivative instruments 
in addition  we purchase certain commodities  such as flour and coffee  for use in our business 
these commodities are sometimes purchased under agreements of one to three year time frames usually at a fixed price 
as a result  we are subject to market risk that current market prices may be above or below our contractual price 
we intend to expand our operations into canadian markets in  primarily through franchise agreements 
as of december   we had no foreign exchange rate fluctuation risk
