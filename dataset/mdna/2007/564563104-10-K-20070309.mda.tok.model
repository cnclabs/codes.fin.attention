item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discontinued operations and note to our consolidated financial statements 
our consolidated financial statements reflect  under the heading discontinued operations  our estimate of the losses expected to be realized upon the disposal of these operations 
even after the disposition of these businesses  we may continue to be exposed to some liabilities arising from their prior operations 
additionally  when we sell one of our subsidiaries  the operative contractual agreement may contain provisions that require us to indemnify the purchaser for certain liabilities that arose prior to the sale date but that are discovered afterwards 
even though these liabilities are often capped  until the indemnification period expires  we may continue to be exposed to such liabilities 
we face competition from other firms  many of which have substantially greater resources 
we operate in highly competitive markets and generally encounter intense competition to win contracts 
we compete with many other firms  ranging from small  specialized firms to large  diversified firms  many of which have substantially greater financial  management and marketing resources than we do 
our competitors may be able to provide our customers with different or greater capabilities or benefits than we can provide in areas such as technical qualifications  past contract performance  geographic presence  price and the availability of qualified professional personnel 
our failure to compete effectively with respect to any of these or other factors could cause our revenue and operating profits to decline 
in addition  our competitors also have established or may establish relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase their ability to address our customers needs 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge 
mr 
pedersen  our chairman and chief executive officer  effectively controls our company  and his interests may not be aligned with those of other stockholders 
as of december   mr 
pedersen owned approximately of our outstanding shares of class a and class b common stock  and owned or controlled approximately of the combined voting power of our stock 
accordingly  mr 
pedersen controls the vote on all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders 
as long as mr 
pedersen beneficially owns a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock  he will have the ability  without the consent of our public stockholders  to elect all members of our board of directors and to control our management and affairs 
mr 
pedersen s voting control may have the effect of preventing or discouraging transactions involving an actual or a potential change of control of the company  regardless of whether a premium is offered over then current market prices 
mr 
pedersen will be able to cause a change of control of the company 
mr 
pedersen could also cause a registration statement to be filed and to become 
table of contents effective under the securities act of  thereby permitting him to freely sell or transfer the shares of common stock that he owns 
in addition  the interests of mr 
pedersen may conflict with the interests of other holders of our common stock 
the loss of any member of our senior management could impair our customer relationships and disrupt the management of our business 
we believe that our success depends in part on the continued contributions of our co founder  chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer  george j 
pedersen  our president and chief operating officer  robert a 
coleman  our chief financial officer  kevin m 
phillips  our senior executive vice president  eugene c 
renzi  and other members of our senior management 
we rely on our executive officers and senior management to generate business and execute programs successfully 
furthermore  the relationships and reputation that members of our management team have established and maintain with government and military personnel contribute to our ability to maintain good customer relations and to identify new business opportunities 
the loss of mr 
pedersen  mr 
coleman  mr 
phillips  mr 
renzi or any other senior management personnel could impair our ability to identify and secure new contracts  to maintain good customer relationships and otherwise to manage our business 
we may be liable for systems and service failures 
we create  implement and maintain information technology and technical services solutions that are often critical to our customers operations  including those of federal  state and local governments 
we have experienced and may in the future experience some systems and service failures  schedule or delivery delays and other problems in connection with our work 
if our solutions  services  products or other applications have significant defects or errors  are subject to delivery delays or fail to meet our customers expectations  we may lose revenues due to adverse customer reaction  be required to provide additional services to a customer at no charge  receive negative publicity  which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our ability to attract or retain customers  and suffer claims for substantial damages against us 
in addition to any costs resulting from product warranties  contract performance or required corrective action  these failures may result in increased costs or loss of revenues if they result in customers postponing subsequently scheduled work or canceling or failing to renew contracts 
while many of our contracts with the federal government limit our liability for damages that may arise from negligence in rendering services to our customers  we cannot be sure that these contractual provisions will protect us from liability for damages if we are sued 
furthermore  our errors and omissions and product liability insurance coverage may not continue to be available on reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims  or the insurer may disclaim coverage as to some types of future claims 
the successful assertion of any large claim against us could seriously harm our business 
even if not successful  these claims could result in significant legal and other costs and may be a distraction to our management and may harm our reputation 
covenants in our credit facility may restrict our financial and operating flexibility 
we maintain a credit and security agreement with citizens bank of pennsylvania 
the agreement initially provides for a million credit facility that can be increased to million 
the maturity date of the agreement is february  under the agreement  we are required to maintain specified financial covenants relating to asset coverage  fixed charge coverage  and debt coverage 
the agreement also places limitations on 
table of contents additional borrowings  mergers  and related party transactions  payment of dividends  and contains limitations with respect to capital expenditures 
borrowings under the agreement are collateralized by our assets and bear interest at the london inter bank offer rate libor  or the lender s base rate  plus market rate spreads that are determined based on a company leverage ratio calculation 
our ability to satisfy these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control  and we cannot assure you that we will meet these ratios 
default under our credit facility could allow the lenders to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable 
we have pledged substantially all of our assets to secure the debt under our credit facility 
if the lenders declare amounts outstanding under the credit facility to be due  the lenders could proceed against those assets 
any event of default  therefore  could have a material adverse effect on our business if the creditors determine to exercise their rights 
we also may incur future debt obligations that might subject us to restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility  restrict our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or subject us to other events of default 
from time to time we may require consents or waivers from our lenders to permit actions that are prohibited by our credit facility 
if our lenders refuse to provide waivers of our credit facility s restrictive covenants and or financial ratios  then we may be in default under our credit facility  and we may be prohibited from undertaking actions that are necessary or desirable to maintain and expand our business 
security breaches in classified government systems could adversely affect our business 
many of the programs we support and systems we develop  install and maintain involve managing and protecting information involved in intelligence  national security and other classified government functions 
while we have programs designed to comply with relevant security laws  regulations and restrictions  a security breach in one of these systems could cause serious harm to our business  damage our reputation and prevent us from being eligible for further work on critical classified systems for federal government customers 
losses that we could incur from such a security breach could exceed the policy limits that we have for errors and omissions or product liability insurance 
damage to our reputation or limitations on our eligibility for additional work resulting from a security breach in one of the systems we develop  install and maintain could materially reduce our revenue 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate 
our quarterly revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future 
a number of factors cause our revenues  cash flow and operating results to vary from quarter to quarter  including fluctuations in revenues earned on fixed price contracts and contracts with a performance based fee structure  commencement  completion or termination of contracts during any particular quarter  reallocation of funds to customers due to priority  timing of award or performance incentive fee notices  timing of significant bid and proposal costs  variable purchasing patterns under government gsa schedule contracts  bpas and id iq contracts  strategic decisions by us or our competitors  such as acquisitions  divestitures  spin offs and joint ventures  seasonal fluctuations in our staff utilization rates  changes in presidential administrations and senior federal government officials that affect the timing of technology procurement  changes in federal government policy or budgetary measures that adversely affect government contracts in general  and 
table of contents increased purchase requests from customers for equipment and materials in connection with the federal government s fiscal year end  which may affect our quarter operating results 
because a relatively large amount of our expenses are fixed  cash flows from our operations may vary significantly as a result of changes in the volume of services provided under existing contracts and the number of contracts that are commenced  completed or terminated during any quarter 
we incur significant operating expenses during the start up and early stages of large contracts  and typically we do not receive corresponding payments in that same quarter 
we may also incur significant or unanticipated expenses when a contract expires  terminates or is not renewed 
payments due to us from federal government agencies may be delayed due to billing cycles or as a result of failures of governmental budgets to gain congressional and administration approval in a timely manner 
the federal government s fiscal year ends september if a federal budget for the next fiscal year has not been approved by that date in each year  our clients may have to suspend engagements that we are working on until a budget has been approved 
any such suspensions may reduce our revenue in the fourth quarter of that year or the first quarter of the subsequent year 
the federal government s fiscal year end can also trigger increased purchase requests from clients for equipment and materials 
any increased purchase requests we receive as a result of the federal government s fiscal year end would serve to increase our third or fourth quarter revenue  but may decrease profit margins for that quarter  as these activities generally may not be as profitable as our typical offerings 
our business depends upon obtaining and maintaining required security clearances 
many of our federal government contracts require our employees to maintain various levels of security clearances  and we are required to maintain certain facility security clearances complying with department of defense requirements 
obtaining and maintaining security clearances for employees involves a lengthy process  and it is difficult to identify  recruit and retain employees who already hold security clearances 
if our employees are unable to obtain or retain security clearances or if our employees who hold security clearances terminate employment with us  the customer whose work requires cleared employees could terminate the contract or decide not to renew it upon its expiration 
in addition  we expect that many of the contracts on which we will bid will require us to demonstrate our ability to obtain facility security clearances and perform work with employees who hold specified types of security clearances 
to the extent we are not able to obtain facility security clearances or engage employees with the required security clearances for a particular contract  we may not be able to bid on or win new contracts  or effectively rebid on expiring contracts 
our employees or subcontractors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities  which could cause us to lose contracts 
while we have ethics and compliance programs in place  we are exposed to the risk that employee fraud or other misconduct could occur 
we enter into arrangements with subcontractors and joint venture partners to bid on and execute particular contracts or programs  as a result  we are exposed to the risk that fraud or other misconduct or improper activities by such persons may occur 
misconduct by employees  subcontractors or joint venture partners could include intentional failures to comply with federal laws including  federal government procurement regulations  proper handling of sensitive or classified information  compliance with the terms of our contracts that we receive  falsifying time records or failures to disclose unauthorized or unsuccessful activities to us 
these actions could lead to civil  criminal  and or administrative penalties including fines  imprisonment  suspension and or debarment from performing federal government contracts and harm our reputation 
the precautions we take to prevent and detect such activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses  and such misconduct by employees  subcontractors or joint venture partners could result in serious civil or criminal penalties or sanctions or harm to our reputation  which could cause us to lose contracts or cause a reduction in revenue 

table of contents we may be harmed by intellectual property infringement claims 
we may be subject to claims from our employees or third parties who assert that software solutions and other forms of intellectual property that we used in delivering services and solutions to our customers infringe upon intellectual property rights of such employees or third parties 
if our vendors  our employees or third parties assert claims that we or our customers are infringing on their intellectual property rights  we could incur substantial costs to defend these claims 
in addition  if any of these infringement claims are ultimately successful  we could be required to cease selling or using products or services that incorporate the challenged software or technology  obtain a license or additional licenses  or redesign our products and services that rely on the challenged software or technology 
item b 
unresolved sec staff comments we have not received any written comments from the sec staff regarding our periodic or current reports under the exchange act that remain unresolved 
item properties our facilities are leased in close proximity to our customers 
since  we have leased our corporate headquarters office building in fairfax  virginia 
the lease on this facility expires in march as of december   we leased additional operating facilities throughout the metropolitan washington  dc area and facilities in other parts of the united states 
we also have employees working at customer sites throughout the united states and in other countries 
during  we acquired two office buildings and another smaller building total of  square feet on approximately acres of land in king george  va for million 
the office buildings are used by our operations

lease expiration dates range from years through 
table of contents item legal proceedings we are subject to certain legal proceedings  government audits  investigations  claims and disputes that arise in the ordinary course of our business 
like most large government defense contractors  our contract costs are audited and reviewed on a continual basis by an in house staff of auditors from the defense contract auditing agency 
in addition to these routine audits  we are subject from time to time to audits and investigations by other agencies of the federal government 
these audits and investigations are conducted to determine if our performance and administration of our government contracts are compliant with contractual requirements and applicable federal statutes and regulations 
an audit or investigation may result in a finding that our performance  systems and administration is compliant or  alternatively  may result in the government initiating proceedings against us or our employees  including administrative proceedings seeking repayment of monies  suspension and or debarment from doing business with the federal government or a particular agency  or civil or criminal proceedings seeking penalties and or fines 
audits and investigations conducted by the federal government frequently span several years 
although we cannot predict the outcome of these and other legal proceedings  investigations  claims and disputes  based on the information now available to us  we do not believe the ultimate resolution of these matters  either individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition or operating results 
item submission of matters to a vote of security holders no matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of the year ended december  
table of contents part ii item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities market information our class a common stock has been quoted on the nasdaq national market under the symbol mant since our initial public offering on february  the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the high and low prices of our shares of common stock  as reported on the nasdaq national market 
high low first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter high low first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter there is no established public market for our class b common stock 
as of february   there were thirty three holders of record of our class a common stock and three holders of record of our class b common stock 
the number of holders of record of our class a common stock is not representative of the number of beneficial holders because many of the shares are held by depositories  brokers or nominees 
dividend policy currently  we intend to retain any earnings for the future operation and growth of our business 
in addition  our credit facility restricts us from paying cash dividends to holders of our common stock 
as a result  we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
no dividends have been declared on any class of our common stock since our initial public offering in any future dividends declared would be at the discretion of our board of directors and would depend  among other factors  upon our results of operations  financial condition and cash requirements  and the terms of our credit facility and other financing agreements at the time such payment is considered

overview we are a leading provider of innovative technologies and solutions for mission critical national security programs for the intelligence community  the departments of defense  state  homeland security  and justice  and other us federal government agencies 
our expertise includes engineering  systems integration  software services  enterprise architecture  information assurance and security architecture  intelligence operations and analysis support  network and critical infrastructure protection  information operations and computer forensics  information technology  communications integration and engineering support 
with nearly  highly qualified employees  we operate in the united states and over countries worldwide 
we derive revenue primarily from contracts with us government agencies that are focused on national security and as a result  funding for our programs is generally linked to trends in us government spending in the areas of defense  intelligence and homeland security 
related to the terrorist events of  the us government has substantially increased its overall defense  intelligence and homeland security budgets 
in  our revenue increased mainly as a result of the expansion of our sustainment and countermine support provided in military deployed environments with us and allied forces in support of peace keeping efforts worldwide  efforts involving telecommunications  infrastructure  maintenance  repair  from our work with intelligence agencies in u 
s  and the acquisitions that occurred in the past two years  primarily gray hawk systems  inc in may for the three years ended december   over of our revenues were derived from our customers in the intelligence community and the department of defense 
these customers include the office of the secretary of defense  the department of state  the department of homeland security  various intelligence agencies  federal intelligence and terrorism task forces  the us army  navy  air force and marine corps and joint military commands 
we also provide solutions to federal government civilian agencies  including nasa  the epa  the department of the interior as well as to state and local governments and commercial customers 
the following table shows our revenue from each type of customer as a percentage of our total revenue for the period shown 
years ended december  department of defense and intelligence agencies federal civilian agencies state agencies and commercial entities total revenue we provide our services and solutions under three types of contracts time and materials  cost reimbursable  and fixed price 
our contract mix varies from year to year due to numerous factors  including our business strategies and federal government procurement objectives 
the following table shows our revenue from each of these types of contracts as a percentage of our total revenue for the periods shown 
years ended december  cost reimbursable time and materials fixed price total revenue 
table of contents time and materials contracts 
under time and materials contracts  we are reimbursed for labor at fixed hourly rates and generally reimbursed separately for allowable materials  costs and expenses 
to the extent that our actual labor costs under a time and materials contract are higher or lower than the billing rates under the contract  our profit under the contract may be either greater or less than we anticipated or we may suffer a loss under the contract 
we recognize revenues under time and materials contracts by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended by the contract billing rates and adding the effect of other billable direct costs 
in general  we realize a higher profit margin on work performed under time and materials contracts than cost reimbursable contracts 
cost reimbursable contracts 
under cost reimbursable contracts  we are reimbursed for costs that are determined to be reasonable  allowable and allocable to the contract  and paid a fee representing the profit margin negotiated between us and the contracting agency  which may be fixed or performance based 
under cost reimbursable contracts we recognize revenues and an estimate of applicable fees earned as costs are incurred 
we consider fixed fees under cost reimbursable contracts to be earned in proportion to the allowable costs incurred in performance of the contract 
for performance based fees under cost reimbursable contracts  we recognize the relevant portion of the expected fee to be awarded by the client at the time such fee can be reasonably estimated  based on factors such as our prior award experience and communications with the client regarding performance 
for cost reimbursable contracts with performance based fee incentives that are subject to the provisions of us securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  we recognize the relevant portion of the fee upon customer approval 
in general  cost reimbursable contracts are the least profitable of our government contracts 
fixed price contracts 
under fixed price contracts  we perform specific tasks for a fixed price 
compared to cost reimbursable and time and materials contracts  fixed price contracts generally offer higher profit margin opportunities but involve greater financial risk because we bear the impact of cost overruns in return for the full benefit of any cost savings 
we generally do not undertake complex  high risk work  such as long term software development  under fixed price terms 
fixed price contracts may include either a product delivery or specific service performance over a defined period 
revenue on fixed price contracts that provide for the company to render services throughout a period is recognized as earned according to contract terms as the service is provided on a proportionate performance basis 
these contracts are generally less than six months in duration 
for fixed price contracts that provide for the delivery of a specific product with related customer acceptance provisions  revenues are recognized as those products are delivered and accepted 
we derive a majority of our revenues from governmental contracts under which we act as a prime contractor 
we also provide services indirectly as a subcontractor 
the following table shows our revenues as prime contractor and as subcontractor as a percentage of our total revenue for the following periods years ended december  prime contract revenue subcontract revenue total revenue revenue substantially all of our revenue is derived from services and solutions provided to the federal government or to prime contractors supporting the federal government  including services provided by our employees and  to a lesser extent  our subcontractors and through solutions that includes third party hardware and software that we purchase and integrate as a part of our overall solutions 
the level of hardware and software purchases we make in support of solutions we provide to our clients increased during these requirements may vary from period to period depending on specific contract and client requirements 
since we earn higher profits from labor 
table of contents services that our employees provide compared with subcontracted efforts and other reimbursable items such as hardware and software purchases for clients  we seek to optimize our labor services on all of our engagements 
cost of services cost of services primarily includes direct costs incurred to provide our services and solutions to customers 
the most significant portion of these costs are direct labor costs  including salaries and wages  plus associated fringe benefits  of our employees directly serving customers  in addition to the related management  facilities and infrastructure costs 
cost of services also includes other direct costs  such as the costs of subcontractors and outside consultants  and third party materials  such as hardware or software that we purchase and provide to the customer as part of an integrated solution 
since we earn higher profits on our own labor services  we expect the ratio of cost of services as a percent of revenue to decline when our labor services mix increases relative to subcontracted labor or third party material 
conversely  as subcontracted labor or third party material purchases for customers increase relative to our own labor services  we expect the ratio of cost of services as a percent of revenue to increase 
changes in the mix of services and equipment provided under our contracts can result in variability in our contract margins 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include the salaries and wages  plus associated fringe benefits of our employees not performing work directly for clients 
among the functions covered by these costs are facilities  corporate business development  bid and proposal  contracts administration  finance and accounting  legal  corporate governance  and executive and senior management 
in addition  we include stock based compensation  as computed under sfas no 
r  as well as depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization includes the depreciation of computers  furniture and other equipment  the amortization of third party software we use internally  leasehold improvements and intangible assets 
identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
interest expense  net interest expense is primarily related to interest expense incurred or accrued under our outstanding borrowings and notes payable  deferred financing charges and interest on capital leases offset by interest income from cash on hand and notes receivable 
provision for income taxes we estimate our effective income tax rate to be approximately  and for the years ended  and  respectively

one contract in support of the installation and repair of systems designed to counter mines and improvised explosive devices ied s accounted for million of revenues in also contributing to the increase was a full year of revenue from our acquisition of gray hawk systems  inc gray hawk on may  gray hawk accounted for million of our increase in revenue year over year 

table of contents cost of services cost of services increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in as a percentage of revenues  cost of services increased  to for the year ended december  compared to for the same period in this increase was due to larger purchases of equipment and materials directly for contracts and increased use of subcontractors in support of our contracts 
the increase in other direct costs resulted in lower income from continuing operations primarily due to generally lower profit margins on purchases of equipment and materials 
direct labor costs  which include applicable fringe benefits and overhead  increased by primarily due to the addition of gray hawk and the growth of our business 
as a percentage of revenues  direct labor costs decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the same period in other direct costs increased by over the same period in  from million to million  which reflects the increase in purchases of equipment and materials  and increased use of subcontractors as noted above

the increase in expense during the year resulted primarily from stock based compensation expense related to the adoption of sfas no 
r  increased business development expenses  and increased expenses for our internal information technology systems due to our growth and improvements 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in bid and proposal spending due to several large recompetitions on our contracts in under sfas no 
r  share based payments not fully vested as of january  and those granted during the year ended december  are measured at estimated fair value and included as compensation expense over the periods services are provided 
for the year ended december   we recognized million in compensation expense as a result of adopting sfas no 
r 
excluding the impact of sfas no 
r  general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue was for the year ended december  the lower percentage reflects management s efforts to improve operating efficiency even though revenues increased by

critical accounting estimates and policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
application of these policies is particularly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of 
table of contents operations 
the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies  including the critical policies listed below  are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
revenue recognition and cost estimation we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been rendered  the contract price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we have a standard internal process that we use to determine whether all required criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
our revenues consist primarily of services provided by our employees  and to a lesser extent  the pass through of costs for materials and subcontract efforts under contracts with our customers 
cost of services consists primarily of compensation expenses for program personnel  the fringe benefits associated with this compensation  and other direct expenses incurred to complete programs  including cost of materials and subcontract efforts 
we derive the majority of our revenue from cost plus fixed fee  cost plus award fee  firm fixed price  or time and materials contracts 
revenues for cost reimbursement contracts are recorded as reimbursable costs are incurred  including an estimated share of the applicable contractual fees earned 
for performance based fees under cost reimbursable contracts  that are subject to the provisions of statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop  we recognize the relevant portion of the expected fee to be awarded by the client at the time such fee can be reasonably estimated  based on factors such as our prior award experience and communications with the client regarding performance 
for cost reimbursable contracts with performance based fee incentives that are subject to the provisions of us securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  we recognize the relevant portion of the fee upon customer approval 
for time and material contracts  revenue is recognized to the extent of billable rates times hours delivered plus material and other reimbursable costs incurred 
for long term fixed price production contracts  revenue is recognized at a rate per unit as the units are delivered  or by other methods to measure services provided 
revenue from other long term fixed price contracts is recognized ratably over the contract period or by other appropriate methods to measure services provided 
contract costs are expensed as incurred except for certain limited long term contracts noted below 
for long term contracts which are specifically described in the scope section of american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  or other appropriate accounting literature we apply the percentage of completion method 
under the percentage of completion method  income is recognized at a consistent profit margin over the period of performance based on estimated profit margins at completion of the contract 
this method of accounting requires estimating the total revenues and total contract cost at completion of the contract 
during the performance of long term contracts  these estimates are periodically reviewed and revisions are made as required 
the impact on revenue and contract profit as a result of these revisions is included in the periods in which the revisions are made 
this method can result in the deferral of costs or the deferral of profit on these contracts 
because we assume the risk of performing a fixed price contract at a set price  the failure to accurately estimate ultimate costs or to control costs during performance of the work could result  and in some instances has resulted  in reduced profits or losses for such contracts 
estimated losses on contracts at completion are recognized when identified 
in certain circumstances  revenues are recognized when contract amendments have not been finalized 

table of contents goodwill goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of acquired companies 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 and no longer amortize goodwill  rather  we review goodwill at least annually for impairment 
we have elected to perform this review annually during the second quarter of each calendar year and no adjustments were necessary 
until the adoption of sfas no 
and sfas no 
on january   we amortized goodwill on a straight line basis over periods ranging from two to twenty years 
as noted above in our discussion of discontinued operations we recorded a loss accrual for the impairment of goodwill related to msm at december  recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which requires the compensation costs related to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
with limited exceptions  the amount of compensation will be measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity instruments issued 
compensation cost will be recognized over the vesting period during which an employee provides service in exchange for the award 
sfas no 
r was effective january  for the company 
we have adopted the modified prospective method for reporting utilizing the black scholes model for valuing our stock based compensation on date of grant 
information about the fair value of stock options under the black scholes model and its pro forma impact on the company s net earnings and earnings per share for the historical periods is illustrated in note of our consolidated financial statements under accounting for stock based compensation in item in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r 
sfas  which represents the completion of the first phase in the fasb s postretirement benefits accounting project  applies to all plan sponsors who offer defined postretirement benefit plans and requires an entity to recognize in its balance sheet an asset for a defined benefit postretirement plan s over funded status or a liability for a plan s under funded status 
measure a defined benefit postretirement plan s assets and obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer s fiscal year 
recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in comprehensive earnings in the year in which the changes occur 
sfas does not change the amount of net periodic benefit cost included in net earnings 
the requirement to recognize the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan and the disclosure requirements are effective for fiscal years ending after december  for public entities 
accordingly  we made adjustments to initially adopt sfas in the fourth quarter of the requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer s fiscal year end balance sheet is effective for fiscal years ending after december  as of december   we had recorded current and non current pension liabilities of million and million  respectively and a deferred tax asset of million

 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions

table of contents by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement criteria for benefits related to income taxes 
the provisions of fin are effective for all reporting periods beginning after december  effective january   we will be required to apply the provisions of fin to all tax positions with any cumulative effect being recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings 
we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or effective tax rate 
in september  the fasb issued statement no 
sfas  fair value measurements  which addresses how companies should measure fair value when they are required to use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes under generally accepted accounting principles

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates for borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we have no debt under revolving credit facility at december  borrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest at variable rates 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates would have increased our annual interest expense for the year ended december  by less than million

at stated monthly intervals the difference between the interest on the floating libor based debt and the interest calculated in the swap agreement was settled in cash 
this agreement expired in december we have no other interest rate swap outstanding during we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we invest our excess cash in short term  investment grade  interest bearing securities 
our investments are made in accordance with an investment policy approved by the board of directors 
under this policy  no investment securities can have maturities exceeding one year and the average maturity of the portfolio cannot exceed days
