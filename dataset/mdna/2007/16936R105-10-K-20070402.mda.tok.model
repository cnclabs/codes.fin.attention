significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our evaluation of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time we were making the estimate  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected would have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
the table below presents information about the nature and rationale for the company critical accounting estimates balance sheet caption critical estimate item nature of estimates required assumptions approaches used key factors accrued liabilities and other long term liabilities warranty obligations estimating warranty requires us to forecast the resolution of existing claims and expected future claims on products sold 
vms are increasingly seeking to hold suppliers responsible for product warranties  which may impact our exposure to these costs 
we base our estimate on historical trends of units sold and payment amounts  combined with our current understanding of the status of existing claims and discussions with our customers 
vm sourcing vm policy decisions regarding warranty claims property  plant and equipment  intangible assets and other long term assets valuation of long lived assets and investments we are required from time to time to review the recoverability of certain of our assets based on projections of anticipated future cash flows  including future profitability assessments of various product lines 
we estimate cash flows using internal budgets based on recent sales data  independent automotive production volume estimates and customer commitments 
future production estimates customer preferences and decisions in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not as critical as those discussed above 
these include the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and reserves for excess and obsolete inventory 
although not significant in recent years  changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to market risk exposures of varying correlations and volatilities  including credit risk  foreign exchange rate risk  interest rate risk and inventory price risk 
credit risk the company s financial instruments that are exposed to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  and accounts receivable from customers cash and cash equivalents are deposited with major state owned banks in the prc 
management has not evaluated the credit risk from banks based on its notion that state owned banks command considerable funds with good reputation 
the company s business activity is primarily with customers in the prc 
the company periodically performs credit analysis and monitors the financial condition of its clients in order to minimize credit risk 
because of the increase of its activities and business  and the increase of customers accounts receivable  there is no assurance that the foresaid measures will be completely effective 
the company has approximately  in accounts receivable as of december  the company s revenues and or operating cash flow would be materially and adversely affected if a allowance for doubtful accounts is introduced  which will mean a reduction of approximately  revenues for the company 
currency exchange rate risk the company s currency exchange rate risks consist primarily of currency from financing 
the company s financing activities were settled in us dollars and deposited in its bank account in us dollars  while the company conducts virtually all of its business and investment activity in china and the value of its business is effectively denominated in renminbi 
the company converts us dollars into rmb to conduct its investment activities and business 
the company does not hedge its rmb us dollar exchange rate exposure 
if rmb appreciates against us dollars  the company s revenues and or operating cash flow might be adversely affected 
the company has dollar holdings of approximately  as at december   if the exchange rate between rmb and us dollars were to increase by  the company would potentially suffer a loss of approximately  currently  the company has not chosen any financial instruments hedges that can provide offsets or limits to its exposures 
market interest rate risk the company has  short term revolving credit lines with annual interest expenses of  if these lines are fully utilized at current rates 
bank loan rates in china have a history of volatility and have been rising recently  and if market interest rates increase by  such increases could result in increased loan interest for the company 
risk of inventory prices the risk to inventory prices of the company comes from the upward movement in prices of raw materials and the downward movement of selling prices 
management believes the latter one is more material 
in recent years  price fluctuation on raw materials was not excessive  but selling prices for steering gears have fluctuated significantly 
during the years to  selling prices for steering gears have decreased approximately each year on an average basis 
as of december   the company s finished goods amount was approximately  if selling prices of steering gears decrease by in  then the income of the company will decrease by
