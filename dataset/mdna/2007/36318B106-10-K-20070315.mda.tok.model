item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
overview and plan of operation we spent fiscal years  and obtaining oil and gas properties in the piceance basin of colorado and the powder river basin of wyoming and montana and obtaining the funding to pay for those properties  commence drilling operations and complete the infrastructure necessary to deliver natural gas to nearby pipelines 
most of this funding has been high interest debt financing 
our tasks now are to establish reserves on our properties and to place our properties into production 
as of march   we had interests in completed wells of which were delivering natural gas into sales pipelines  wells in various stages of completion and water disposal wells 
we recorded our first revenues from natural gas sales during the fiscal year ended november  and we currently are producing about thousand cubic feet per day 
as our first wells come online in the piceance basin over the next few months and as our coal bed methane wells continue to dewater and increase their production of natural gas  we expect to generate significantly more revenues during the current fiscal year 
we anticipate that these revenues  while significantly larger than in fiscal and  will not be sufficient to fund completely our planned operations  debt repayment and commitments 
at november   our working capital deficit was  as of december   we had contractual obligations due by november  totaling  as explained more fully below 
to meet these obligations and working capital needs  we have entered into a purchase and sale agreement psa with petrohunter a related party 
pursuant to the psa  we agreed to sell all of our powder river basin assets 
the purchase price for the powder river basin assets is million  with million to be paid in cash and million to be paid in shares of petrohunter common stock at the rate of per share 
if this sale is completed  we would pay off all of our convertible debt  leaving as our only outstanding debt the notes due to bruner family trust  totaling  as of march  and a note purchased by bruner family trust in the principal amount of  at november  we believe that we would then be able to continue to pursue funding and industry participation alternatives to ensure our ability to continue to acquire additional acreage and complete additional drilling activity in the piceance basin 
there are significant contingencies in connection with this proposed sale  including the ability of petrohunter to raise the funds required to complete this transaction 
if this proposed sale is not completed  we will be forced to find another buyer and suitable terms for a sale of the property 
if we cannot find another buyer and suitable terms for a sale  we may be forced to seek the protection of bankruptcy laws 
furthermore  we may be required to reduce the sale price  which could result in a significant impairment and loss to the company to the carrying value of this asset 
going concern the report of our independent registered public accounting firm on the financial statements for the year ended november   includes an explanatory paragraph indicating substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern 
we have incurred a cumulative net loss  for the period from inception to november  we require significant additional funding to sustain our operations and satisfy our contractual obligations for our planned oil and gas exploration and development operations 
our ability to establish the company as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain additional financing  in order to fund our planned operations and ultimately  to achieve profitable operations 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities 
for the fiscal year  we used  for operating activities  as compared to  for fiscal and  for fiscal among the larger adjustments to reconcile the net loss of  to net cash used by operating activities for fiscal was  for amortization of discount and deferred financing costs on convertible debt and  for finance costs incurred for the waiver of triggering event described below 
in contrast  the adjustments for fiscal to the net loss of  included  for stock issued for interest   for amortization of discount and deferred financing costs on convertible debt   for write off of discount and deferred financing costs upon conversion of convertible debt  and  for impairment of oil and gas properties 
for fiscal  we incurred a smaller net loss of  but also had smaller adjustments  the more significant of which included  for amortization of discount and deferred financing costs on convertible debt and  for write off of discount and deferred financing costs upon extinguishment of convertible debt 
investing activities 
we used  for net investing activities  after recoveries  in fiscal  as compared to  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
we used substantially less cash for additions to oil and gas properties in   compared to  and  in and  respectively 
the significant decrease in cash expenditures during reflects our capital constraints during the year and our focus on the piceance basin operations rather that the powder river as in earlier years 
in the piceance we were carried for the first million of operational expenditures and had only a working interest thereafter  in and we focused on the powder river basin  in which we have generally have much higher working interests 
during we drilled wells and acquired additional acreage in the piceance basin  expending a total of approximately million of which our share of expenditures was approximately million 
we also recovered million in management fees under the joint venture agreement with exxel 
this recovered amount was offset against the capital costs incurred in accordance with full cost accounting rules 
in the powder river basin we expended approximately million primarily on dewatering operations and development drilling in the west recluse area 
financing activities 
since inception  we have funded our operating and investing activities through the sale of our debt and equity securities  raising net proceeds of  through the period ended november  financing activities provided cash of  in fiscal  as compared to  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
from december through may  we sold  shares of common stock for gross proceeds of  in october  we completed a  private placement of secured convertible debentures and warrants  due two years from date of issue and secured by substantially all of our assets 
debentures purchasers received five year warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share and  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
we filed a registration statement covering the shares underlying the debentures and warrants  but did not meet the deadline associated with this filing obligation 
we paid a penalty of  to the holders of the debentures 
during the year ended november   all of the debentures were converted at per share into  shares of common stock 
in december  we completed a private placement of  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase  common shares  resulting in gross proceeds of  the warrants were exercisable for a four year period at an original price of per share 
in accordance with the antidilutive rights provisions  the exercise prices of those warrants with original exercise prices in excess of were reset to per share  in connection with the issuance of the notes 
we granted registration rights to the purchasers in this private placement 
we completed a second private placement of  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase  common shares in january  resulting in gross proceeds of  the warrants were exercisable for a five year period at an original price of per share 
in accordance with the antidilutive rights provisions  the exercise prices of those warrants with original exercise prices in excess of were reset to per share  in connection with the issuance of the notes 
we granted registration rights to the purchasers in this private placement as well 
in august and october  we completed two tranches of a private placement of senior secured convertible notes the notes and warrants the warrants 
gross proceeds from the initial tranche were  while gross proceeds from the second tranche were  the notes pay interest at the prime rate plus per annum  originally matured two years from the date of issue  are collateralized by substantially all of our assets  and were originally convertible into  shares of our common stock based on a conversion price of per share 
in january  under the terms of the notes  we were required to pay accumulated interest to that date 
commencing on march  we were required to make monthly payments of principal in the amount of  plus accrued interest 
for the year ended november   we made total payments on the notes of  consisting of  in principal repayments and  of interest 
of that amount we paid  or of the total payment  using shares of common stock 
note purchasers received the three year  warrants  which originally allowed the holders to purchase  shares of common stock at per share 
on march   we completed a private placement of  in senior subordinated convertible notes the march notes to a group of accredited investors to fund our entry into our piceance basin project 
the march notes are payable on april  but are subordinated in payment to the notes  accrue interest at the prime rate plus per annum  adjusted quarterly and payable at maturity  and were originally convertible into  shares of our common stock based on a conversion price of per share 
march note purchasers received three year warrants the warrants  which originally allowed the holders to purchase  shares of common stock at per share 
on may   we completed a private offering of senior secured convertible notes to essentially the same group of accredited investors that purchased our notes and warrants the may notes 
gross proceeds from the offering were  the may notes are secured by a security interest in all of our assets and the domestic properties of our subsidiaries 
such security interest ranks equally with that of the notes  and senior to the march notes 
the may notes mature and are payable on may  but can be redeemed by the holders after may  and bear interest at the prime rate plus  adjusted and payable quarterly 
the may notes were originally convertible into  shares of our common stock based on a conversion price of per share 
in addition  the investors received a perpetual overriding royalty interest orri in our domestic acreage averaging from to  depending upon the nature and location of the property  a right of first refusal with respect to future debt and or equity financings  and a right to participate in any farm out financing transactions that do not have operating obligations by the financing party as a material component 
on december   we entered into a waiver and amendment agreement the waiver and amendment with the holders of the notes and the holders of the notes 
under the agreement  we and the holders waived all claims in connection with dolphin energy corporation  our wholly owned subsidiary  having entered into a third amendment to participation agreement with our partner in our piceance basin project  exxel energy corporation as of october  the third amendment set the working interest between us and exxel at  consistent with the original intent of the parties 
as such  the third amendment clarified that exxel was obligated to pay the next million in project costs to bring its payments to of the total costs  thereby adjusting for us having paid about of the land cost to get the project started 
in addition  the waiver and amendment  among other things  effected the following changes o lowered the conversion price to for conversions by the holders of the notes  the may notes  and the march notes  o lowered the exercise price of the warrants and the warrants to per share and increased the aggregate number of shares purchasable under the warrants from  to  o caused the exercise price of warrants issued in december and january being lowered to under the anti dilution provisions of such warrants  o deferred monthly installment payments on the notes until april   o extended the maturity date of the notes to july   and o extended any redemption or conversion of the notes by galaxy until june  on april   we entered into a securities purchase agreement with several accredited investors pursuant to which the investors purchased in the aggregate   principal amount of subordinated convertible debentures 
in addition  the investors also received three year warrants that allow the holders to purchase  shares of common stock at per share 
the debentures are convertible at any time by the holders into shares of our common stock at a price equal to  are subordinated to all of our senior debt  pay interest at per annum  payable at maturity  and have a term of months  which will extend automatically until all of our senior debt has been retired 
additionally  in the event the debentures are retired at maturity  the holders are entitled to an additional payment equal to the sum of plus for each month or part thereof in excess of months that the debentures have remained outstanding 
on june   we entered into a securities purchase agreement with an accredited investor pursuant to which the investor purchased  principal amount of subordinated convertible debentures on the same terms and conditions set forth in the previous paragraph 
during the year ended november   we issued four separate subordinated unsecured promissory notes for a total of  in favor of bruner family trust utd march  the bruner family trust  a related party 
one of the trustees of the bruner family trust is marc e 
bruner  the president and a director of the company 
interest accrues at the rate of per annum and the note matures at the later of days from issue or the time at which our senior indebtedness has been paid in full on november   we entered into a waiver and amendment agreement the waiver and amendment with the holders of the notes and the notes 
we had earlier notified the holders of the notes and may notes of the fact that our accounts payable had exceeded the permitted  ceiling set forth in the notes and may notes  thereby resulting in a triggering event under the terms of those notes 
among other things  this would have enabled the holders of the notes to require us to redeem all or any portion of the outstanding principal amount of the notes at a price equal to the greater of i of such principal plus accrued and unpaid interest and ii the product of the current conversion rate in effect under the notes multiplied by the volume weighted average price of our common stock 
the holders agreed to waive the triggering event in consideration for an amendment to the notes and may notes that reset the principal amounts of the notes to of the amounts outstanding as of october  we and the holders also agreed to waive any future triggering event that might result from our accounts payable exceeding  however  if our accounts payable should exceed  it would result in an immediate breach of the notes 
we and the holders agreed to other amendments with respect to the notes and may notes and warrants previously issued by us to the holders 
we also obtained the consent of the holders of the notes and may notes to the proposed sale of our powder river basin assets the prb sale to petrohunter as described herein under item business proposed sale to petrohunter energy corporation 
such consent is required as the holders have a security interest covering these assets 
as a condition to the note holders consent  the prb sale must be completed by march   we must be in compliance with the waiver and amendment agreement and all of our obligations under the various agreements with the note holders 
further  we will be required to i pay the notes and may notes in full  ii deliver to the holders  of the petrohunter shares to be received by us as part of the prb sale consideration and  shares of our common stock and iii retire all of our outstanding subordinated convertible debt using the consideration we receive in the prb sale 
additionally  the holders and petrohunter must enter into a suitable registration rights agreement with respect to the  petrohunter shares 
because the prb sale was not consummated by january   we issued  additional shares of our common stock to the holders in order to maintain their consent to the prb sale  as required under the waiver and amendment 
we have agreed to register these shares 
in october  bruner family trust  a related party  acquired a promissory note we had issued to dar  llc in the original principal amount of  while the note  as amended  had a stated maturity date of december   bruner family trust has stated that it will not enforce its rights under the note until june  working capital deficiency 
as of november   we had a working capital deficiency of  compared to a working capital deficiency of  at november  included in current liabilities at november  is the current portion of convertible notes payable of  and related accrued interest of  we may  subject to certain conditions  make payment of these amounts in shares of common stock rather than cash 
for the year ended november   we made total payments on the notes of  consisting of  in principal repayments and  of interest 
of that amount we have paid  using shares of common stock  with the balance  paid in cash 
we may  subject to certain conditions  make payment of the amounts due on the convertible notes in shares of common stock rather than cash 
for the time being  however  we expect to make these payments in cash 
our drilling program for the coming year will require additional capital and will require us to raise additional funds by selling equity securities  issuing debt  selling assets  or engaging in farm outs or similar types of arrangements 
any financing obtained through the sale of our equity will likely result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
if we are forced to sell assets to meet our operating and capital requirements  we may not realize the full market value of the assets and the sales price could be less than our carrying value of the assets

footnote this table excludes the costs of drilling obligations in our european permits 
together with our partners we have met certain of the preliminary obligations  however we have not determined that we will conduct those operations 
in the event we do not fulfill those drilling obligations  we will forfeit a portion of the permit 
we have excluded asset retirement obligations because we are not able to precisely predict the timing for these amounts 
under certain conditions  as described elsewhere in this report  we have the option to pay the principal and interest with shares of common stock instead of cash

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to impairment of long lived assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  however  we believe that our estimates  including those for the above described items  are reasonable 
oil and gas properties we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas operations 
under this method  all costs related to the exploration for and development of oil and gas reserves are capitalized on a country by country basis 
costs include lease acquisition costs  geological and geophysical expenses  overhead directly related to exploration and development activities and costs of drilling both productive and non productive wells 
proceeds from the sale of properties are applied against capitalized costs  without any gain or loss being recognized  unless such a sale would significantly alter the rate of depletion and depreciation 
depletion of exploration and development costs and depreciation of production equipment is provided using the unit of production method based upon estimated proven oil and gas reserves 
the costs of significant unevaluated properties are excluded from costs subject to depletion 
for depletion and depreciation purposes  relative volumes of oil and gas production and reserves are converted at the equivalent conversion based upon relative energy content 
in applying the full cost method  we perform a ceiling test whereby the carrying value of oil and gas properties and production equipment  net of recorded future income taxes and the accumulated provision for site restoration and abandonment costs  is compared annually to an estimate of future net cash flow from the production of proven reserves 
costs related to undeveloped oil and gas properties are excluded from the ceiling tests 
discounted net cash flow  utilizing a discount rate  is estimated using year end prices  less estimated future general and administrative expenses  financing costs and income taxes 
should this comparison indicate an excess carrying value  the excess is charged against earnings 
for the years ended november  and  we recognized impairment expense of  and  respectively  representing the excess of capitalized costs over the ceiling amount 
the company intends to sell a significant portion of its oil and gas properties and has negotiated a purchase and sale agreement with a related party to dispose of those assets 
full cost accounting rules do not include provisions for segregating those assets and identifying them as held for sale 
accordingly  those assets are reflected on the balance sheet as either evaluated and unevaluated oil and gas properties  as appropriate 
asset retirement obligation in  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
this statement requires companies to record the present value of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets in the period in which it is incurred 
the liability is capitalized as part of the related long lived asset s carrying amount 
over time  accretion of the liability is recognized as an operating expense and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the expected useful life of the related asset 
our asset retirement obligations aro relate primarily to the plugging  dismantlement  removal  site reclamation and similar activities of our oil and gas properties 
prior to adoption of this statement  such obligations were accrued ratably over the productive lives of the assets through its depreciation  depletion and amortization for oil and gas properties without recording a separate liability for such amounts 
as of november   we had  through acquisition and drilling  acquired working interests in natural gas wells 
a limited number of these wells had initial gas production during the period  and the others were in various stages of completion and hook up at november  we adopted the provisions of sfas to record the aro associated with all wells in which we own an interest on the date such obligation arose 
depreciation of the related asset  and accretion of the aro on wells from which production has commenced  has been calculated using our estimate of the life of the wells  based upon the lives of comparable wells in the area 
the amounts recognized upon adoption are based upon numerous estimates and assumptions  including future retirement costs  future recoverable quantities of oil and gas  future inflation rates and the credit adjusted risk free interest rate 
impairment of long lived assets our long lived assets include property and equipment 
we assess impairment of long lived assets whenever changes or events indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in performing our assessment we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates change in the future we may be required to record impairment charges against these respective assets 
stock based compensation on december   we adopted fas no 
r  accounting for stock based compensation  using the modified prospective method  which results in the provisions of fas r being applied to the consolidated financial statements on a going forward basis 
prior periods have not been restated 
fas r requires companies to recognize share based payments to employees as compensation expense on a fair value method 
under the fair value recognition provisions of fas r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the service period  which generally represents the vesting period 
the expense recognized over the service period is required to include an estimate of the awards that will be forfeited 
previously  no such forfeitures have occurred 
we are assuming no forfeitures going forward based on our historical forfeiture experience 
the fair value of stock options is calculated using the black scholes option pricing model 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp eitf  accounting for registration payment arrangements 
this fsp specifies that the contingent obligation to make future payments or otherwise transfer consideration under a registration payment arrangement should be separately recognized and measured in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies 
this fsp is effective immediately for registration payment arrangements and the financial instruments subject to those arrangements that are entered into or modified subsequent to december  for registration payment arrangements and financial instruments subject to those arrangements that were entered into prior to december   the guidance in the fsp is effective january  for us 
we do not believe that this fsp will have a material impact on our financial position or results from operations 
in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments an amendment of fasb statements no

to interests in securitized financial assets so that similar instruments are accounted for in a similar fashion  regardless of the instrument s form 
we do not believe that our financial position  results of operations or cash flows will be impacted by sfas no 
as we do not currently hold any hybrid financial instruments
