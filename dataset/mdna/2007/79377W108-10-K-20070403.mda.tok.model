the company estimates the amount of goods that will be returned for a refund and reduces sales and gross margin by that amount 
however  given that approximately of merchandise sold is later returned and that the vast majority of merchandise returns are effected within a matter of days of the selling transaction  the risk of the company realizing a materially different amount for sales and gross margin than reported in the consolidated financial statements is minimal 
cost of sales and inventory valuation  excluding depreciation and amortization the company s inventory is stated at the lower of lifo cost or market using the retail method 
under the retail method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are determined by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
the cost of the inventory reflected on the consolidated balance sheet is decreased with a charge to cost of sales contemporaneous with the lowering of the retail value of the inventory on the sales floor through the use of markdowns 
hence  earnings are negatively impacted as the merchandise is being devalued with markdowns prior to the sale of the merchandise 
the areas requiring significant management judgment include setting the original retail value for the merchandise held for sale  recognizing merchandise for which the customer s perception of value has declined and appropriately marking the retail value of the merchandise down to the perceived value  and estimating the shrinkage that has occurred through theft during the period between physical inventory counts 
these judgments and estimates  coupled with the averaging processes within the retail method  can  under certain circumstances  produce varying financial results 
factors that can lead to different financial results include setting original retail values for merchandise held for sale at too high a level  failure to identify a decline in perceived value of inventories and process the appropriate retail value markdowns and overly optimistic or overly conservative shrinkage estimates 
the company believes it has the appropriate merchandise valuation and pricing controls in place to minimize the risk that its inventory values would be materially under or overvalued

index to financial statements the company receives vendor provided support in different forms 
when the vendor provides support for inventory markdowns  the company records the support as a reduction to cost of sales 
such support is recorded in the period that the corresponding markdowns are taken 
when the company receives inventory related support that is not designated for markdowns  the company includes this support as a reduction in cost purchases 
self insurance reserves the company self insures a substantial portion of the exposure for costs related primarily to employee medical  workers compensation and general liability 
expenses are recorded based on estimates for reported and incurred but not reported claims considering a number of factors  including historical claims experience  severity factors  litigation costs  inflation and other assumptions 
although the company does not expect the amount it will ultimately pay to differ significantly from estimates  self insurance reserves could be affected if future claims experience differs significantly from the historical trends and assumptions 
depreciation and recoverability of capital assets over forty percent of the company s assets at february  are represented by investments in property and equipment 
determining appropriate depreciable lives and reasonable assumptions for use in evaluating the carrying value of capital assets requires judgments and estimates 
the company principally utilizes the straight line depreciation method and a variety of depreciable lives 
land is not depreciated 
buildings and improvements are depreciated over to years 
store fixtures are depreciated over years 
equipment utilized in stores eg  escalators and in support areas eg  distribution centers  technology and fixtures in support areas are depreciated over to years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or their related lease terms  generally ranging from to years 
internally generated computer software is amortized over to years 
generally  no estimated salvage value at the end of the useful life of the assets is considered 
when constructing stores  the company receives allowances from landlords 
if the landlord is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the property  then the portion of those allowances attributable to the property owned by the landlord is considered to be a deferred rent liability  whereas the corresponding capital expenditures related to that store are considered to be prepaid rent 
allowances in excess of the amounts attributable to the property owned by the landlord are considered improvement allowances and are recorded as deferred rent liabilities that are amortized over the life of the lease 
capital expenditures are also reduced when the company receives cash and allowances from merchandise vendors to fund the construction of vendor shops 
to the extent the company remodels or otherwise replaces or disposes of property and equipment prior to the end of their assigned depreciable lives  the company could realize a loss or gain on the disposition 
to the extent assets continue to be used beyond their assigned depreciable lives  no depreciation expense is being realized 
the company reassesses the depreciable lives in an effort to reduce the risk of significant losses or gains at disposition and utilization of assets with no depreciation charges 
the reassessment of depreciable lives involves utilizing historical remodel and disposition activity and forward looking capital expenditure plans 
recoverability of the carrying value of store assets is assessed upon the occurrence of certain events eg  opening a new store near an existing store or announcing plans for a store closing and  absent certain events  annually 
the recoverability assessment requires judgment and estimates for future store generated cash flows 
the underlying estimates for cash flows include estimates for future sales  gross margin rates  inflation and store expenses 
during  the company recorded million in 
table of contents 
index to financial statements impairment charges in the normal course of business 
in addition  the company recorded a million charge primarily due to lease termination costs related to store closings 
there are several stores in which current cash flows are not adequate to recover the carrying value of the store assets 
however  the company believes that estimated sales growth and gross margin improvement will enhance the cash flows of these stores such that the carrying value of the store assets will be recovered 
generally these stores were recently opened and require a two to five year period to develop the customer base to attain the required cash flows 
to the extent management s estimates for sales growth and gross margin improvement are not realized  future annual assessments could result in impairment charges 
leases the company leases stores  distribution centers  and administrative facilities under operating leases 
store lease agreements generally include rent holidays  rent escalation clauses and contingent rent provisions for percentage of sales in excess of specified levels 
most of the company s lease agreements include renewal periods at the company s option 
the company recognizes rent holiday periods and scheduled rent increases on a straight line basis over the lease term beginning with the date the company takes possession of the leased space and includes such rent expense in store pre opening costs 
the company records tenant improvement allowances and rent holidays as deferred rent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and amortizes the deferred rent over the terms of the lease to rent expense in the consolidated statements of income 
the company records rent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets for contingent percentage of sales lease provisions when the company determines that it is probable that the specified levels will be reached during the fiscal year 
income and other taxes the majority of the company s deferred tax assets at february  consist of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards that will expire between and during the valuation allowance against net operating loss carryforwards was reduced based on projections of future profitability 
at february  the company believes that it will be sufficiently profitable during the periods from to to utilize all of its federal nols and a significant portion of its state nols 
to the extent management s estimates of future taxable income by jurisdiction are greater than or less than management s current estimates  future increases or decreases in the benefit for net operating losses could occur 
the company is routinely under audit by federal  state and local authorities in the areas of income taxes and the remittance of sales and use taxes 
audit authorities may question the timing and amount of deductions  the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with federal  state and local tax laws 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions  the company often accrues for exposures related to uncertain tax positions 
during  the company concluded a federal income tax examination for the and tax years and concluded a number of state income tax examinations as well 
the company decreased the amount previously accrued for exposures related to uncertain tax positions by million 
during  the company recorded a benefit of million related to the expiration of the statute of limitations with respect to certain tax examination periods which was recorded as a credit to shareholder s equity in accordance with statement of position financial reporting by entities in reorganization under the bankruptcy code 
in addition  an increase to the reserve for tax exposures of million was recorded as an income tax expense for additional exposures 
at february   the company believes it has appropriately accrued for exposures related to uncertain tax positions

pension assumptions are based upon management s best estimates  after consulting with outside investment advisors and actuaries  as of the annual measurement date 
the assumed discount rate utilized is based upon pension discount curves and bond portfolio curves over a duration similar to the plan s liabilities as of the measurement date

at november   the discount rate was 
to the extent the discount rate increases or decreases  the company s abo is decreased or increased  respectively 
the estimated effect of a change in the discount rate is million on the abo and million on annual pension expense 
to the extent the abo increases  the after tax effect of such increase serves to reduce other comprehensive income and shareholders equity

it is the company s policy to invest approximately of the pension fund assets in equities  in fixed income securities and in real estate 
this expected average long term rate of return on assets is based principally on the advice of the company s outside investment advisors 
this rate is utilized principally in calculating the expected return on plan assets component of the annual pension expense 
to the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater than the assumed rate  that year s annual pension expense is not affected 
rather  this gain reduces future pension expense over a period of approximately to years

in light of these patterns  sg a expenses are typically higher as a percentage of net sales during the first three fiscal quarters of each year  and working capital needs are greater in the last two fiscal quarters of each year 
the increases in working capital needs during the fall season have typically been financed with cash flow from operations and borrowings under the company s revolving credit agreement 
generally  more than of the company s sales are generated during the fourth quarter and a large portion of its operating income is generated during the fall season

 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation clarifies the application of statement by defining a criterion that an individual tax position must meet for any part of the benefit of that position to be recognized in an enterprise s financial statements 
for a benefit to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
the benefit to be recognized for a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information
