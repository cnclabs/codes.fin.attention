item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties  including those set forth under the heading risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our actual results and the timing of selected events discussed below could differ materially from those expressed in  or implied by  these forward looking statements 
overview we are a biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of drugs based on metabolic targeting  an approach that targets fundamental differences in metabolism between normal and certain diseased cells 
two of our product candidates were designed to utilize metabolic targeting through the potential targeting of the increased uptake of glucose in cancer cells relative to most normal cells 
these product candidates  glufosfamide and deoxyglucose dg  share certain structural characteristics with glucose but act instead as poisons when taken up by a cancer cell 
our other product candidate  th  and the other compounds our scientists are creating and testing in our laboratories  use metabolic targeting by targeting the decreased blood supply and oxygenation of most tumor tissues relative to normal tissue 
these compounds are relatively non toxic when oxygen is present  as in healthy tissues  but undergo a chemical conversion in the presence of low levels of oxygen that converts them into toxic compounds that may kill cancer cells 
this pipeline of drug candidates is designed to target tumor cells selectively  and we believe that our drugs could be more efficacious and less toxic to healthy tissues than conventional drugs  and thereby provide significant improvement over current therapies 
our initial clinical focus is on product candidates for the treatment of cancer 
we have three product candidates for which we have exclusive worldwide marketing rights glufosfamide is our lead product candidate for the potential treatment of cancer 
we initiated a pivotal phase clinical trial of glufosfamide for the second line treatment of pancreatic cancer in september  and completed enrollment in august in february  we announced that this phase clinical trial failed to reach its primary endpoint of survival benefit for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer that have relapsed following chemotherapy with gemcitabine 
in july  we completed enrollment in the phase stage of a study of glufosfamide plus gemcitabine for the first line treatment of pancreatic cancer 
top line results were announced in december and  final results are expected in third quarter of we have initiated phase trials of glufosfamide in platinum resistant ovarian and recurrent sensitive small cell lung cancer  and plan to initiate a phase trial in soft tissue sarcoma in the first half of enrollment in these trials is expected to be completed in  with results reported in deoxyglucose  or dg  our second product candidate for the potential treatment of cancer  is being evaluated in a phase clinical trial alone and in combination with docetaxel as a combination therapy 
this trial began in the first quarter of and we expect to complete enrollment for this trial in the first half of top line results are expected in the third quarter of th is a hypoxically activated prodrug for the potential treatment of solid tumors  and is in late stage preclinical testing 
th was discovered by threshold  is a novel drug candidate that is activated under the metabolic conditions typical of certain cancer cells 
if the preclinical tests are supportive we plan to file an ind with the fda in the first half of we also are working to discover novel drug candidates that will specifically target cancer cells and are actively seeking to in license other promising compounds or programs 

table of contents we are a development stage company incorporated in october we have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and development of our product candidates 
we have not generated any revenue from the sale of our product candidates  and  prior to our initial public offering in february  we funded our operations through the private placement of equity securities 
in february  we completed our initial public offering that raised net proceeds of million  and in october  we completed an offering of common stock that raised net proceeds of million 
as of december  we had cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities of million 
the net loss for was million and the cumulative net loss since our inception through december  was million 
in july  we announced we were discontinuing development of th for benign prostatic hyperplasia bph based on safety and efficacy results of recently concluded phase and phase trials 
in august   we adopted a plan to reduce our operating expenses  which included eliminating full time employees  or approximately a reduction in staff affecting all areas of the company 
as a result of the staffing reduction we incurred severance benefits of approximately million in the third quarter of annual cash savings from the reduction in salary and benefit expenses are estimated to be approximately million 
we also expect additional savings in certain non employee related costs 
we expect to continue to incur losses from operations in the future 
we expect that expenses will decrease in compared to due to a reduced workforce and smaller clinical trials  and that our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements through at least mid  including completing our current and planned clinical trials and conducting research and discovery efforts toward additional product candidates 
research and development expenses may fluctuate significantly from period to period as a result of the progress and results of our clinical trials 
revenue we have not generated any revenue from the sale of our product candidates since our inception and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of our product candidates at least within the next couple of years 
through  we recognized million in revenue related to a million upfront payment received in connection with a agreement with medibic co  ltd  or medibic  for the development of glufosfamide in japan and several other asian countries 
the payment was contingent upon the finalization of the clinical development plan  which occurred in july revenue is being recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated development period  currently estimated to continue through we are responsible for all development activities under this agreement 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of costs of conducting clinical trials  salaries and related costs for personnel including non cash stock based compensation  costs of clinical materials  costs for research projects and preclinical studies  costs related to regulatory filings  and facility costs 
contracting and consulting expenses are a significant component of our research and development expenses as we rely on consultants and contractors in many of these areas 
we recognize expenses as they are incurred 
our accruals for expenses associated with preclinical and clinical studies and contracts associated with clinical materials are based upon the terms of the service contracts  the amount of services provided and the status of the activities 
we expect annual research and development expenses will decrease significantly in the future as we progress with a reduced workforce and smaller clinical trials 
from inception through december   we incurred an aggregate of million on research and development expenses  including non cash stock based compensation expense 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for our personnel in the executive  finance  patent  accounting and other administrative functions  including non cash stock based compensation  as well as consulting costs for functions for which we either do not staff or only partially staff  including 
table of contents public relations  market research and recruiting 
other costs include professional fees for legal and accounting services  insurance and facility costs 
from inception through december   we incurred an aggregate of million on general and administrative expenses  including non cash stock based compensation expense 
stock based compensation prior to january   we used the intrinsic method of accounting principles board opinion no

for stock options granted to employees no compensation expense was recognized unless the exercise price was less than fair market value at the date of grant 
stock based compensation expense was recognized under apb no 
for options granted prior to the company s initial public offering of its common stock in february based upon the intrinsic value the difference between the exercise price at the date of grant and the deemed fair value of the common stock based on the anticipated initial public offering stock price 
in anticipation of our initial public offering which was completed in february  we determined that  for accounting purposes  the deemed fair value of our common stock was greater than the exercise price for certain options 
as a result  we have recorded deferred stock based compensation for these options of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
this expense  which is a non cash charge  has been amortized over the period in which the options vest  which is generally four years 
the amortization of this expense recognized for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
beginning january   we began accounting for stock based compensation using the fair value method prescribed by sfas no

results of operations for the years ended december  and revenue for the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million in revenue related to a million upfront payment received in connection with a agreement with medibic for the development of glufosfamide in japan and several other asian countries 
revenue is being recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated development period  currently estimated to be through we are responsible for all development activities under this agreement 
research and development research and development expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase in expenses is due to a million increase in clinical and development expenses and million in higher staffing and facilities expenses  including million in severance expense related to staff reductions 
in addition  stock based compensation expense decreased by million primarily due to a million decrease in non employee stock based compensation expense and amortization of our deferred stock compensation charge partially offset by a million increase in employee stock based compensation as result of our adoption of sfas r beginning january  research and development expenses by project in thousands year ended december  glufosfamide th th dg discovery research total research and development expenses 
table of contents research and development expenses associated with glufosfamide were million for the and million for this increase is due to a million increase in clinical and manufacturing expenses and a million increase in staffing expenses 
research and development expenses associated with th were million for and million for the this increase in expenses was due to an increase of million in expenses associated with our phase united states trial initiated in june and our eu phase trial initiated in august 
these increases were partially offset by million in lower stock based compensation and staffing expenses for the th project 
research and development expenses associated with our internally discovered compound th were million in  as the compound progressed through preclinical studies 
research and development expenses associated with dg were million for and million for this decline was primarily due to lower clinical expenses 
discovery research and development expenses were million for and million for the million increase was primarily due to increases in staffing costs to support expansion of our discovery research programs 
we did not track research and development expenses by project prior to  and therefore we cannot provide cumulative project expenses to date 
due to the risks and uncertainties involved in discovering and developing product candidates  such as clinical trial results  regulatory approval requirements  dependence on third parties and market acceptance  all of which are described in risk factors  we cannot reasonably estimate the costs and timing of completion of each project or when any project will result in net cash inflows 
we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development in future periods as we continue our current clinical trials  start additional trials and continue our discovery efforts 
research and development expenses are expected to decrease in compared to due to a smaller clinical trials and a reduced workforce 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million for  compared to million for the million increase reflects million increase in staffing expenses including million in severance expense related to staff reductions  an increase in stock based compensation expenses of million primarily due to the adoption of sfas r and additional expenses associated with being a public company 
we currently expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease in due to lower salary and benefit related expenses as a result of staff reductions and no anticipated material changes in administrative and infrastructure costs 
interest and other income interest income for was million compared to million for the increase was primarily due to higher invested cash balances and higher average interest rates during compared to the prior year due to proceeds received from our follow on offering completed in october interest expense interest expense for the years ended december  and was million and  respectively  reflecting the increase in the balance of our note payable due to million of borrowing in against our amended loan and security agreement 
results of operations for the years ended december  and revenue for the year ended december  we recognized million in revenue related to a million upfront payment received in connection with a agreement with medibic for the development of glufosfamide in

the payment was contingent upon the finalization of the clinical development plan  which occurred in july revenue is being recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated development period or through research and development research and development expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase in expenses is due to a million increase in clinical and development expenses  a million increase in expenses associated with higher staffing levels  a million increase in non cash stock based compensation expense and a million increase in expenses related to new facilities 
research and development expenses associated with th were million for compared to million for this million increase in expenses was primarily due to the initiation of our phase united states and phase european trials and an increase in staffing and related expenses 
research and development expenses associated with glufosfamide were million and million for and  respectively 
this increase is primarily due to expenses associated with the phase clinical trial 
research and development expenses associated with dg were million and million for and  respectively 
the decrease is primarily attributable to a reduction in dg project staffing and related costs 
discovery research and development expenses were million and million for and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to increases in staffing and related costs to support expansion of our discovery research program 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million increase in general and administrative expenses primarily reflects additional expenses associated with becoming a public company in  including million of higher legal fees  insurance premiums  and consulting services  and million of expenses related to higher staffing levels 
additionally  the increase in general and administrative expenses in compared to was due to million of increased patent expenses and a million increase in non cash stock based compensation expenses 
interest and other income interest income for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was due to greater invested cash balances due to proceeds received from our initial public offering completed in february and our follow on offering completed in october  as well as higher average interest rates in interest expense interest expense for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively  reflecting the declining balance of our note payable 
liquidity and capital resources we have incurred net losses since inception through december  of million 
we have not generated any product revenues and do not expect to generate revenue from the sale of product candidates at least within the next couple of years 
from inception until our initial public offering in february  we funded our operations primarily through the private placement of our preferred stock 
in february  we completed our initial public offering of  shares of our common stock  raising net proceeds of million 
in october  we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock for net proceeds of million 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million compared to million and million at december  and  respectively 

table of contents net cash used in operating activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   cash used in operations resulted from the net loss for the year after adding back non cash charges for stock based compensation expense  depreciation expenses and deferred revenue 
for the year ended december   cash used in operations resulted from the net loss for the year after adding back non cash charges for stock based compensation expense  additional accruals for clinical and development expenses and personnel related expenses  depreciation expense and deferred revenue 
for the year ended december  cash used in operations was attributable to our net loss after adjustments for non cash charges related to the amortization of deferred stock based compensation  an increase in accrued liabilities for clinical trials and staffing  and the receipt of a research and development contract advance under our development agreement with medibic 
net cash used in investing activities of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  was primarily used for purchases of marketable securities of million  million and million in  and  respectively  capital spending of million  million and million in  and  respectively  partially offset by sales of marketable securities of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   which was primarily attributable to borrowings under a loan and security agreement  net of repayments and to lesser extent cash from stock option exercises and sale stock under the employee stock purchase plan 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   primarily from the two public offerings completed during the year our initial public offering that was completed in february and raised million of net proceeds  and our follow on offering that was completed in october and raised million of net proceeds 
net cash used by financing activities was million for the year ended december   primarily for deferred costs related to the initial public offering in february  which were partially offset by borrowings under a loan agreement  net of repayments 
we expect cash requirements to be in the range of million to million 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december  will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements through at least mid  including completing our current and planned trials  conducting research and discovery efforts towards additional product candidates  working capital and general corporate purposes 
additional funds will be required to in license or otherwise acquire and develop additional products or programs 
we intend to seek funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently 
additionally  we may need or choose to raise additional capital or incur indebtedness to continue to fund our operations in the future 
our ability to raise additional funds will depend on our clinical and regulatory events  our ability to identify promising in licensing opportunities  and factors related to financial  economic  and market conditions  many of which are beyond our control 
we cannot be certain that sufficient funds will be available to us when required or on satisfactory terms 
if necessary funds are not available  we may have to delay  reduce the scope or eliminate some of our research and development  which could delay the time to market for any of our product candidates 
obligations and commitments in march  we entered into a loan and security agreement with a financial institution to borrow up to million for working capital and equipment purchases 
as of december   we had borrowed the full amount under this facility  which is being repaid over a month period from the dates of borrowing 
these borrowings bear interest at an average rate of per year at december  in april  we amended the existing loan and security agreement to borrow up to an additional million for working capital and equipment purchases 
the interest rate for borrowings under this facility will be determined based on the month us treasury note plus on the date of borrowing 
we borrowed million under this facility  which will be repaid over a month period from the date of borrowing 
the interest rate on these borrowings was approximately per annum 
at december   the total amount due under this facility was 
table of contents million 
we may borrow up to an additional million for equipment purchases 
the amended agreement requires us to maintain the lower of of our total cash and cash equivalents or million at the financial institution 
at december   we were in compliance with this covenant 
in august  we entered into a noncancelable facilities sublease agreement that expires on february  for our headquarters in redwood city  california 
on april   we entered into a noncancelable facilities lease agreement that expires on february  for additional laboratory space in redwood city  california 
in february  we entered into a lease for an additional  square feet of space and increased the lease term for the existing space located at our headquarters in redwood city  california to september  the lease is for a period of months  beginning on april  with respect to the additional square footage and will begin on march  with respect to the existing square footage 
the lease will expire  unless otherwise terminated under the terms of the lease  on september  the aggregate rent for the term of the lease is approximately million 
in addition  the lease requires us to pay certain taxes  assessments  fees and other costs and expenses associated with the premises as well as a customary management fee 
we are also responsible for the costs of certain tenant improvements associated with the leased space 
in connection with the lease  we furnished a letter of credit to the landlord for approximately million 
our major outstanding contractual obligations consist of amounts due under our financing and lease agreements  and purchase commitments 
contractual obligations and related scheduled payments as of december   are as follows in thousands within one year one to three years four to five years after five years total facilities sublease and lease notes payable  principal and interest purchase commitments total in november  we entered into an agreement with medibic to develop glufosfamide in japan and several other asian countries  and received an upfront payment of million contingent upon the finalization of the clinical development plan 
in july  we finalized the development plan with medibic and began recognizing revenue from the upfront payment on a straight line basis over the development period  currently estimated to be through we are responsible for all development activities under this agreement 
we will also be required to make royalty payments upon product commercialization 
we may terminate the agreement at any time by making certain payments ranging from million to million  depending on the stage of development of the glufosfamide product in japan 
in august  we entered into an agreement with baxter international and baxter healthcare sa  together baxter  for the licensing and development of glufosfamide 
under this agreement  we paid baxter an upfront license fee of million and a million development milestone in we also made a development milestone payment of million in november and we are obligated to make certain additional development milestone payments  with the next payment due in connection with the filing of a new drug application with the fda for glufosfamide 
we will be required to make a milestone payment of million within days of filing an nda for glufosfamide with the fda 
future milestone payments in connection with the development of glufosfamide and united states and foreign regulatory submissions could total up to million  and sales based milestone payments could total up to million 
following regulatory approval  we will be obligated to pay up to mid single digit royalties to baxter based on sales of glufosfamide products 
we cannot be certain when  if ever  we will have to make development or sales based milestone or royalty payments to baxter 

table of contents under our license agreement with dr 
theodore j 
lampidis and dr 
waldemar priebe for rights under a patent and certain patent applications that generally cover the treatment of cancer with dg in combination with certain other cancer drugs  we are obligated to make certain milestone payments  including milestone payments of up to million in connection with the filing and approval of an nda for the first product covered by the licensed patents  as well as royalties based on sales of such products 
we cannot be certain when  if ever  we will have to make these milestone or royalty payments 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
therefore  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
income taxes we incurred net operating losses for the years ended december    and and  accordingly  we did not pay any federal or state income taxes 
as of december   we had accumulated approximately million in both federal and state net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future taxable income 
if not utilized  our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in and for federal and state tax purposes  respectively 
our net operating loss carryforwards are subject to certain limitations on annual utilization in case of changes in ownership  as defined by federal and state tax laws 
at december   we had research credit carryforwards of approximately million and million for federal and california state income tax purposes  respectively 
if not utilized  the federal carryforwards will expire in through the california state research credit can be carried forward indefinitely 
we have not recorded a benefit from our net operating loss or research credit carryforwards because we believe that it is uncertain that we will have sufficient income from future operations to realize the carryforwards prior to their expiration 
accordingly  we have established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset arising from the carryforwards 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and related disclosures 
we review our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation beginning on january   we began accounting for stock options and stock purchase rights related to our employee stock purchase plan under the provisions of sfas r  which requires the recognition of the fair value of stock based compensation 
the fair value of stock options and espp shares was estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
this model requires the input of subjective assumptions in 
table of contents implementing sfas r  including expected stock price volatility  expected life and estimated forfeitures of each award 
the fair value of equity based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award  and we have elected to use the straight line method of amortization 
due to the limited amount of historical data available to us  particularly with respect to stock price volatility  employee exercise patterns and forfeitures  actual results could differ from our assumptions 
prior to the implementation of sfas r  we accounted for stock options and espp shares under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and made pro forma footnote disclosures as required by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amended sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
pro forma net loss and pro forma net loss per share disclosed in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements were estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
the fair value of our common stock for options granted through the date of the initial public offering in february was originally estimated by our board of directors  with input from management 
we did not obtain contemporaneous valuations by an unrelated valuation specialist 
subsequently  we reassessed the valuations of common stock relating to grants of options during the period from january  through the date of our initial public offering and the years ended december  and as disclosed more fully in note of the notes of our consolidated financial statements  we granted stock options and restricted common stock with exercise prices ranging from to per share during the period from january  through the date of our initial public offering and the years ended december  and in addition  we determined that the fair value of our common stock increased from to per share during that period 
for financial reporting purposes  we have recorded stock based compensation representing the difference between the estimated fair value of common stock and the option exercise price 
because shares of our common stock were not publicly traded before our initial public offering in february  we determined the estimated fair value based upon several factors  including significant milestones attained  sales of our redeemable convertible preferred stock  changes in valuations of existing comparable publicly registered biotech companies  trends in the broad market for biotechnology stocks and the expected valuation we would obtain in an initial public offering 
although it was reasonable to expect that the completion of our initial public offering would add value to the shares as a result of increased liquidity and marketability  the amount of additional value could not be measured with precision or certainty 
we amortize employee stock based compensation on a straight line basis for equity instruments subject to fixed accounting 
we amortize employee stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans for equity instruments subject to variable accounting 
we account for equity instruments issued to non employees in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods  or services 
as a result  the non cash charge to operations for non employee options with vesting or other performance criteria is affected each reporting period by changes in the estimated fair value of our common stock 
the two factors which most affect these changes are the fair value of the common stock underlying stock options for which stock based compensation is recorded and the volatility of such fair value 
if our estimates of the fair value of these equity instruments change  it would have the effect of changing compensation expenses 
preclinical and clinical trial accruals most of our preclinical and clinical trials are performed by third party contract research organizations  or cros  and clinical supplies are manufactured by contract manufacturing organizations  or cmos 
invoicing from these third parties may be monthly based upon services performed or based upon milestones achieved 
we accrue these expenses based upon our assessment of the status of each study and the work completed  and upon information obtained from the cros and cmos 
our estimates are dependent upon the timeliness and accuracy of data provided by the cros and cmos regarding the status and cost of the studies  and may not match the 
table of contents actual services performed by the organizations 
this could result in adjustments to our research and development expenses in future periods 
to date we have had no significant adjustments 
marketable securities we classify all of our marketable securities as available for sale 
we carry these investments at fair value  based on quoted market prices  and unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income which is reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity 
the amortized cost of securities in this category is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretions of discounts to maturity 
such amortization is included in interest income 
realized gains and losses are recorded in our statement of operations 
if we believe that an other than temporary decline exists  it is our policy to record a write down to reduce the investments to fair value and record the related charge as a reduction of interest income 
accounting for income taxes our income tax policy records the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets  as based on available objective evidence  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
this interpretation requires that we recognize in our financial statements the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
the provisions of fin are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with the cumulative effect  if any  of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
the adoption of fin is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
topic n 
quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  sab no 

sab no 
addresses how the effect of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab no 
requires sec registrants i to quantify misstatements using a combined approach which considers both the balance sheet and income statement approaches  ii to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors  and iii to adjust their financial statements if the new combined approach results in a conclusion is that an error is material 
sab no 
addresses the mechanics of correcting misstatements that include effects from prior years 
it indicates that the current year correction of a material error that includes prior year effects may result in the need to correct prior year financial statements even if the misstatement in the prior year or years is considered immaterial 
any prior year financial statements found to be materially misstated in originating in years subsequent to the issuance of sab no 
 prior year financial statements requiring restatement would be restated in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections 
because the combined approach represents a change in practice  the sec staff will not require registrants that followed an acceptable approach in the past to restate prior years historical financials statements 
rather  these registrants can report the cumulative effect of adopting the new approach as an adjustment to the current year s beginning balance of retained earnings 
if the new approach is adopted in a quarter other than the first quarter  financial statements for prior interim periods within the year of adoption may need to be restated 
sab no 
is effective for fiscal years ending after november  the adoption of sab no 
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measures sfas no 

sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap  expands disclosures about fair value measurements  and applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
sfas no 
does not require any new fair value measurements 
however  the fasb anticipates that for some entities  the application of sfas no 
will change current practice 
we will be required to adopt sfas no 
for financial statements in the first quarter of we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas no 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure of market risks interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash equivalents on deposit in highly liquid money market funds and investments in short term marketable securities 
the primary objective of our cash investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our invested cash without significantly increasing risk of loss 
we invest in high quality financial instruments  which currently have weighted average maturity of less than one year 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our cash and investments policy emphasizes liquidity and preservation of principal over other portfolio considerations 
our investment portfolio is subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates rise 
however  due to the short duration of our investment portfolio we believe an increase in the interest rates of one percentage point  would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  we do not have any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations as we operate primarily in the united states 
although we conduct some clinical and safety studies  and manufacture some active pharmaceutical product with vendors outside the united states  most of our transactions are denominated in us dollars
