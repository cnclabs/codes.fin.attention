index to financial statements us domestic package operations compared to us domestic package revenue increased billion  or  for the year  with average daily package volume up 
volume gains were realized across all products primarily due to a solid us economy  strong small package market and continuing efforts to generate new volume 
overall domestic volume growth moderated in the latter half of compared with  due to slower overall economic growth in the us and a downturn in industrial production during the fourth quarter 
pricing remained firm as overall revenue per piece was up for the year 
ground revenue per piece increased and next day air revenue per piece increased for the year  primarily due to the impact of a rate increase that took effect in and the impact of an increased fuel surcharge rate in compared to deferred revenue per piece increased for the year for the same reasons  but was adversely affected by the growth in lighter weight  lower revenue packages 
on january   a rate increase took effect which was in line with previous years rate increases 
we increased rates on ups next day air  ups nd day air  and ups day select  and on ups ground

us domestic package operating profit increased million  or  for the year  and the operating margin increased by approximately basis points to 
this increase was primarily a result of the revenue growth described previously  combined with efficiencies from leveraging our integrated ground and air networks 
the operating profit for our us domestic package segment was negatively impacted by a tentative settlement of a class action litigation see contingencies section below  which resulted in an million charge to expense 
the expense associated with our self insurance accruals for workers compensation claims  automotive liability and general business liabilities was million less in compared with insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims  as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported 
recorded balances are based on ultimate reserve levels determined by outside actuaries  who incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim 
the lower expense reflects favorable claims experience resulting from company initiatives put into place over the last several years and other factors  including initiatives to decrease accident frequencies  improved oversight and management of claims  improved trends in health care costs  and favorable state legislative reforms  primarily in california

excluding the impact of the overnite acquisition in august  segment revenues grew for the year 
total average daily ltl shipments for ups freight in declined against the full year both the pre and post acquisition period due to service issues caused by the integration of the ups freight business  as well as a weakening in the overall ltl market in the united states in the latter half of ltl revenue per ltl hundredweight increased as we proactively reduced less profitable accounts and focused on higher yielding customer segments 
forwarding and logistics revenue increased million  or for the year  largely due to continued changes in the business model for this unit 
the forwarding and logistics business is moving towards a model that places more transactional ownership risk on ups  including increased utilization of ups owned assets 
this has the effect of increasing revenue as well as purchased transportation expense 
the increased revenue associated with these forwarding transactions was somewhat offset by certain revenue management initiatives  which involved reducing less profitable accounts 
in addition  revenue increased by million during the year due to currency fluctuations 
the other businesses within supply chain freight  which include our retail franchising business and our financial business  increased revenue by during the year 
this revenue growth was primarily due to increased financial services revenue  as well as revenue earned from our previously announced contract to provide domestic air transportation for the us postal service 
for the year  the supply chain freight segment reported million in operating profit  as compared with a million in operating profit for these results were impacted by the integration of the acquired menlo worldwide forwarding business into our air network  and the integration of the motor cargo business unit within the acquired overnite corp 
operations into the ups freight network 
the ups freight integration led to service issues  which resulted in a loss of revenue  as well as productivity setbacks resulting in increased costs 
the integration of the menlo worldwide forwarding business resulted in increased costs and some lost sales resulting from customer turnover 
the increase in operating profit was positively affected by million during due to the impact of currency fluctuations on revenue and expense 

index to financial statements in an effort to rationalize our cost structure and focus on profitable revenue growth  we initiated a restructuring plan for our forwarding and logistics operations in the fourth quarter of this restructuring plan is expected to generate efficiencies resulting in improved operating profits by further integrating all of our transportation services to better serve our customers 
this restructuring involves plans to reduce non operating expenses by approximately  including a reduction in non operating staff of approximately  people 
as of december   million in costs have been accrued related to employee severance

overall growth continues to benefit from the expansion of our freight forwarding network throughout the world  as well as the increase in global trade and the increased outsourcing of manufacturing and distribution 
during the third quarter of  we completed our acquisition of overnite corp  now known as ups freight  which offers a variety of ltl and truckload services to customers in north america 
overnite s results have been included in the supply chain freight reporting segment since the august  acquisition date 
overnite generally reported improvements in its operating performance measures in the post acquisition period versus the same period a year ago when it was not a part of ups  including improvements in average daily ltl shipments and average ltl revenue per ltl hundredweight 
the other businesses within supply chain freight  which include our retail franchising business  our mail and consulting services  and our financial business  increased revenue by during the year

operating profit and margin were negatively affected by operating losses incurred in the acquired menlo worldwide forwarding operations  as well as costs incurred in integrating this business into our existing forwarding services business 
currency fluctuations positively affected operating profit by million during the year 
operating profit also was favorably impacted by million due to a change in our management incentive awards program discussed below in operating expenses 
operating expenses compared to consolidated operating expenses increased by billion  or  for the year  and were significantly impacted by the acquisitions of overnite  stolica  and lynx 
currency fluctuations in our international package and supply chain freight segments resulted in operating expenses increasing by million for the year 
compensation and benefits increased by billion  or  for the year  largely due to the acquisitions mentioned above  as well as increased health and welfare benefit costs and higher pension expense 
these increases were partially offset by the decline in workers compensation expense  as previously discussed 
excluding the effect of acquisitions  compensation and benefits expense increased for the year 
stock based and other management incentive compensation expense increased million  or in  due to the expensing of restricted stock units granted in the fourth quarter of  the impact of a new grant of stock options and restricted performance units in the second quarter of  and the impact of adopting the non substantive vesting period approach of fas r discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these grants were partially offset by lower accruals for our management incentive awards program in 
index to financial statements other operating expenses increased by billion  or  for the year  largely due to the acquisitions mentioned above  as well as increases in fuel expense and purchased transportation 
the table below indicates the impact of business acquisitions completed in on the increase in operating expenses by category in total increase acquisition impact increase without acquisitions other operating expenses repairs and maintenance depreciation and amortization purchased transportation fuel other occupancy other expenses excluding the effect of acquisitions  the increase in fuel expense for the year was impacted by higher prices for jet a  diesel and unleaded gasoline as well as higher usage  but was partially mitigated by hedging gains 
the increase in purchased transportation was influenced by volume growth in our international package business  currency fluctuations  higher fuel prices  increased rail costs  and changes to the freight forwarding business model described previously 
the increase in repairs and maintenance was largely due to increased expense on airframe and engine repairs 
the increase in depreciation and amortization for the year was caused primarily by higher depreciation expense on plant equipment  aircraft and engines  and higher amortization expense on intangible assets 
the increase in other occupancy expense was largely due to higher electricity and other utilities expenses 
the increase in other expenses was impacted by several items  including the million tentative settlement of a class action litigation see contingencies section below 
compared to consolidated operating expenses increased by billion  or  for the year  and were significantly impacted by the acquisitions of menlo worldwide forwarding and overnite

stock based and other management incentive compensation expense decreased million  or  in the year  due to a change in our management incentive awards program implemented in  described in the next paragraph  which was partially offset by the impact of prospectively adopting the measurement provisions of fas beginning with stock based compensation awards 
during the first quarter of  we modified our management incentive awards program under our incentive compensation plan to provide that half of the annual award be made in restricted stock units rsus 
the rsus granted in november under this program have a five year graded vesting period  with approximately of the total rsu award vesting at each anniversary date of the grant 
the other half of the award granted in november was in the form of cash and unrestricted shares of class a common stock and was fully vested at the time of grant 
previous awards under the management incentive awards program were made in common stock that was fully vested in the year of grant 
this change had the effect of lowering expense 
as a result  expense for our management incentive awards program reported in operating expenses under compensation and benefits  including the rsus  decreased million million after tax  or per diluted share compared with 
index to financial statements other operating expenses increased by billion  or  for the year  largely due to the menlo worldwide forwarding and overnite acquisitions  as well as increases in fuel expense and purchased transportation

the increase in repairs and maintenance was largely due to higher expense on vehicle parts partially affected by the overnite acquisition  airframe and aircraft engine maintenance 
the increase in depreciation and amortization for the year was impacted by higher depreciation expense on buildings largely due to acquisitions  aircraft  and capitalized software 
the increase in other occupancy expense was largely due to higher facilities rent expense in our supply chain freight segment  which was impacted by the menlo worldwide forwarding acquisition  and increased utilities expense 
the increase in other expenses was primarily due to the overnite acquisition  but partially offset by the absence in of the million aircraft impairment charge that we incurred in investment income and interest expense compared to the decrease in investment income of million during the year was primarily due to a lower average balance of interest earning investments  due to the timing of cash payments for pension fundings  business acquisitions  and capital expenditures 
this was partially offset by a higher average interest rate earned on investments  as well as the absence of any investment impairments during million of investment impairments were recognized in  as described below 
the million increase in interest expense during the year was primarily due to higher average interest rates on variable rate debt and interest rate swaps  as well as interest expense incurred on debt related to real estate investment partnerships 
this was partially offset by slightly lower average debt balances during  as well as higher capitalized interest due to large aircraft contract deposit payments made during the year 
compared to the increase in investment income of million during the year was primarily due to higher average yields earned caused by the increasing short term interest rates in the united states  but partially offset by a lower average balance of interest earning investments  increased equity method losses on certain investment partnerships  and an investment impairment charge on certain available for sale securities 
we periodically review our investments for indications of other than temporary impairment considering many factors  including the extent and duration to which a security s fair value has been less than its cost  overall economic and market conditions  and the financial condition and specific prospects for the issuer 
after considering these factors  we recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of related to several variable rate preferred securities issued by the federal national mortgage association fnma and the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc 
the million increase in interest expense for the year was primarily due to higher floating interest rates on variable rate debt and interest rate swaps  as well as higher imputed interest expense associated with real estate investment partnerships

rate changes for shipments originating outside the us are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market 
net cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities was billion  million  and billion in   and  respectively

we have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this case 
at this time  we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from this matter or whether such liability  if any  would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
in another case  cornn v 
ups  which has been certified as a class action in a california federal court  plaintiffs allege that they were improperly denied wages and or overtime and meal and rest periods 
plaintiffs purport to represent a class of approximately  drivers and seek back wages  penalties  interest and attorneys fees 
ups has agreed in principle to settle this matter in full for a total payment of million 
on december   the court granted tentative approval of the settlement 

index to financial statements we are named as a defendant in four putative class action lawsuits filed in federal courts  alleging a conspiracy relating to certain surcharges by a number of air cargo carriers 
we are not named as a defendant in at least eighty six related cases that make similar allegations 
these cases have been consolidated in a multi district litigation proceeding pending in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york 
ups was not included as a defendant in the amended consolidated complaint on which the multi district litigation is proceeding 
in addition  in july  we were named as a defendant in a comparable lawsuit filed in the ontario canada superior court of justice 
we intend to vigorously defend ourselves in these cases 
we are a defendant in various other lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business 
we believe that the eventual resolution of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
we participate in a number of trustee managed multi employer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements 
several factors could result in potential funding deficiencies which could cause us to make significantly higher future contributions to these plans  including unfavorable investment performance  changes in demographics  and increased benefits to participants 
at this time  we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions  if any  or whether any material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity would result from our participation in these plans 
as of december   we had approximately  employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the international brotherhood of teamsters teamsters 
these agreements run through july  in the third quarter of  we began formal negotiations with the teamsters on a new agreement 
we have approximately  pilots who are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the independent pilots association ipa 
on june   ups and the ipa announced a tentative agreement on a new labor contract  which was ratified in the third quarter 
this new contract becomes amendable at the end of our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with teamsters local  which became amendable on november  we began formal negotiations with teamsters local on october  in addition  the majority of our ground mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the international association of machinists and aerospace workers 
these agreements run through july  other matters on july   we received a grand jury subpoena from the antitrust division of the us department of justice doj 
the subpoena relates to the doj s publicly announced criminal investigation of the air cargo pricing practices of a number of domestic and foreign airlines 
we do not believe that we are a target of this investigation and we intend to cooperate 
with the assistance of outside counsel  we investigated certain conduct within our supply chain solutions subsidiary in certain locations outside the united states 
our investigation determined that certain conduct  which commenced prior to our subsidiary s acquisition of a freight forwarding business that was part of fritz companies inc  may have violated the united states foreign corrupt practices act 
the monetary value involved in this conduct appears to be immaterial 
we have implemented numerous remediation steps 
we informed the sec and the doj of our investigation  and we intend to cooperate fully with any review by the government of these issues 
we do not believe that the results of this investigation  the remediation or related penalties  if any  will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  liquidity or results of operations  nor do we believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 
market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and equity prices 
all of these market risks arise in the normal course of business  as we do not 
index to financial statements engage in speculative trading activities 
in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures  we utilize a variety of foreign exchange  interest rate  equity and commodity forward contracts  options  and swaps 
the following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to commodity price risk  foreign currency exchange risk  interest rate risk  and equity price risk 
we utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous  parallel shifts in exchange rates  interest rate yield curves  and commodity and equity prices 
for options and instruments with non linear returns  models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts 
there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented  primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously 
in addition  the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 
a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
commodity price risk we are exposed to an increase in the prices of refined fuels  principally jet a  diesel  and unleaded gasoline  which are used in the transportation of packages 
additionally  we are exposed to an increase in the prices of other energy products  primarily natural gas and electricity  used in our operating facilities throughout the world 
we use a combination of options  swaps  and futures contracts to provide some protection from rising fuel and energy prices 
these derivative instruments generally cover forecasted fuel and energy consumption for periods of one to three years 
the net fair value of such contracts subject to price risk  excluding the underlying exposures  as of december  and was an asset of and million  respectively 
the potential loss in the fair value of these derivative contracts  assuming a hypothetical adverse change in the underlying commodity price  would be approximately and million at december  and  respectively 
this amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities 
in the second quarter of  we terminated several energy derivatives and received million in cash 
these derivatives were designated as hedges of forecasted cash outflows for purchases of fuel products 
as these derivatives maintained their effectiveness and qualified for hedge accounting  we anticipate that the gains associated with these hedges will be recognized in income over the original term of the hedges through foreign currency exchange risk we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue  operating expenses  and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate 
we are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currency denominated assets  liabilities  and cash flows 
our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the euro  the british pound sterling and the canadian dollar 
we use a combination of purchased and written options and forward contracts to hedge cash flow currency exposures 
these derivative instruments generally cover forecasted foreign currency exposures for periods up to one year 
as of december  and  the net fair value of the hedging instruments described above was an asset of and million  respectively 
the potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately and million at december  and  respectively 
this sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in the foreign currency exchange rates 
exchange rates rarely move in the same direction 
the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 

index to financial statements interest rate risk as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have issued debt instruments  including debt associated with capital leases  that accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest 
we use a combination of derivative instruments  including interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps  as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing 
these swaps are generally entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify  and the notional amount  interest payment  and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt 
our floating rate debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in short term primarily libor interest rates 
the potential change in annual interest expense resulting from a hypothetical basis point change in short term interest rates applied to our floating rate debt and swap instruments at december  and would be approximately million each year 
we have investments in debt and preferred equity securities including auction rate securities  as well as cash equivalent instruments  some of which accrue income at variable rates of interest 
the potential change in annual investment income resulting from a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates applied to our investments exposed to variable interest rates at december  and would be approximately and million  respectively 
additionally  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we hold a portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest 
the potential change in the annual income resulting from a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates applied to our variable rate finance receivables at december  and would be immaterial 
this interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous  parallel shifts in the yield curve 
in reality  interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel 
while this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios  these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts 
we adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions 
equity price risk we hold investments in various common equity securities that are subject to price risk  and for certain of these securities  we utilize options to hedge this price risk 
at december  and  the fair value of such investments was and million  respectively 
the potential change in the fair value of such investments  assuming a change in equity prices net of the offsetting impact of any hedges  would be approximately and million at december  and credit risk the forward contracts  swaps  and options previously discussed contain an element of risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements 
however  we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting the counterparties to large banks and financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines 
we do not expect to incur any losses as a result of counterparty default 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement no 
employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r fas 
this statement requires the recognition of the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as an asset or liability in the balance sheet for fiscal years ending after december  
index to financial statements fas also requires delayed recognition items  consisting of actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs and credits  to be recognized in other comprehensive income and subsequently amortized to the income statement 
on december   we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of fas the effect of adopting fas on our balance sheet as of december  has been included in note to the consolidated financial statements  while there was no effect on our balance sheet for prior periods 
additionally  we currently utilize the early measurement date option available under statement no 
employers accounting for pensions  and we measure the funded status of our plans as of september each year 
under the provisions of fas  we will be required to use a december measurement date for all of our pension and postretirement benefit plans no later than we do not expect the impact of the change in measurement date to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 

this interpretation was issued to clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  financial statement classification  tax related interest and penalties  and additional disclosure requirements 
we are required to adopt this interpretation effective january  we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of this standard on our financial statements 
any necessary transition adjustments will not affect net income in the period of adoption and will be reported as a change in accounting principle in our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued statement no 
fair value measurements fas  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  fas was issued to define fair value  establish a framework for measuring fair value  and expand disclosures about fair value measurements 
fas is not anticipated to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
the adoption of the following recent accounting pronouncements did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition fsp aug air accounting for planned major maintenance activities  fas accounting for servicing of financial assets  and fsp fas accounting for a change in the timing of cash flows related to income taxes generated by a leveraged lease transaction 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as indicated in note to our consolidated financial statements  the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles 
we base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances 
actual results could differ from our estimates  which would affect the related amounts reported in our financial statements 
while estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts  we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
contingencies as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies 
we have recorded liabilities for these matters in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies fas 
fas requires a liability to be recorded based on our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency 
the actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates 
if a contingency is settled for an amount greater than our estimate  a future charge to income would result 
likewise  if a contingency is settled for an amount that is less than our estimate  a future credit to income would result 

index to financial statements the events that may impact our contingent liabilities are often unique and generally are not predictable 
at the time a contingency is identified  we consider all relevant facts as part of our fas evaluation 
we record a liability for a loss that meets the recognition criteria of fas these criteria require recognition of a liability when the loss is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable 
events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs from our previously estimated liability 
these factors could result in a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 
contingent losses that meet the recognition criteria under fas  excluding those related to income taxes and self insurance which are discussed further below  were not material to the company s financial position as of december  in addition  we have certain contingent liabilities that have not been recognized as of december   because a loss is not reasonably estimable 
goodwill impairment we account for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas  which requires annual impairment testing of goodwill for each of our reporting units 
goodwill impairment testing requires that we estimate the fair value of our goodwill and compare that estimate to the amount of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet 
we use a discounted cash flow model dcf model to estimate the fair value of our goodwill 
the completion of the dcf model requires that we make a number of significant assumptions to produce an estimate of future cash flows 
these assumptions include projections of future revenue  costs and working capital changes 
in addition  we make assumptions about the estimated cost of capital and other relevant variables  as required  in estimating the fair value of our reporting units 
the projections that we use in our dcf model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units 
as of december   our recorded goodwill was billion  of which billion relates to our supply chain and freight segment 
this segment of our business has experienced rapid growth over the last several years  largely due to a number of acquisitions that we have made 
because of its growth  this segment continues to experience significant change as we integrate the acquired companies  resulting in higher volatility in our dcf model projections than for our other segments 
our annual impairment tests performed in  and resulted in no goodwill impairment 
self insurance accruals we self insure costs associated with workers compensation claims  automotive liability  health and welfare  and general business liabilities  up to certain limits 
insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims  as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported 
recorded balances are based on reserve levels determined by outside actuaries  who incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim 
trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves 
we believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate  but actual experience in claim frequency and or severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations 
workers compensation  automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take several years to completely settle 
consequently  actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve the claims 
a number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim  including the length of time the claim remains open  trends in health care costs and the results of related litigation 
furthermore  claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections 
changes in state legislation with respect to workers compensation can affect the adequacy of our self insurance accruals 
all of these factors can result in revisions to prior actuarial projections and produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 
we sponsor a number of health and welfare insurance plans for our employees 
we use estimates from third party actuaries to establish the liabilities for these plans 
these liabilities and related expenses are based on 
index to financial statements estimates of the number of employees and eligible dependents covered under the plans  anticipated medical usage by participants and overall trends in medical costs and inflation 
actual results may differ from these estimates and  therefore  produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 
pension and postretirement medical benefits as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we maintain several defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans 
our pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies as prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
these assumptions include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  inflation  rate of compensation increases  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  and other factors 
actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
we believe that the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our outside actuaries and other advisors and information as to historical experience and performance 
differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense 
a basis point change in the assumed discount rate  expected return on assets  and health care cost trend rate for the pension and postretirement benefit plans would result in the following increases decreases on the company s costs and obligations for the year in millions basis point increase basis point decrease pension plans discount rate effect on net periodic benefit cost effect on projected benefit obligation return on assets effect on net periodic benefit cost postretirement medical plans discount rate effect on net periodic benefit cost effect on projected benefit obligation health care cost trend rate effect on net periodic benefit cost effect on projected benefit obligation financial instruments as discussed in notes    and to our consolidated financial statements  and in the market risk section of this report  we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk 
certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value 
fair values are based on listed market prices  when such prices are available 
to the extent that listed market prices are not available  fair value is determined based on other relevant factors  including dealer price quotations 
certain financial instruments  including over the counter derivative instruments  are valued using pricing models that consider  among other factors  contractual and market prices  correlations  time value  credit spreads  and yield curve volatility factors 
changes in the fixed income  equity  foreign exchange  and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future  potentially affecting our results of operations 
a quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to changes in commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and equity prices is presented in the market risk section of this report 
depreciation  residual value  and impairment of fixed assets as of december   we had billion of net fixed assets  the most significant category of which is aircraft 
in accounting for fixed assets  we 
index to financial statements make estimates about the expected useful lives and the expected residual values of the assets  and the potential for impairment based on the fair values of the assets and the cash flows generated by these assets 
in estimating the lives and expected residual values of aircraft  we have relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types 
subsequent revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to our maintenance program  changes in the utilization of the aircraft  governmental regulations on aging aircraft  and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types 
we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions  and adjust the estimates and assumptions as necessary 
adjustments to the expected lives and residual values are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense 
in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas  we review long lived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset 
if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable  a write down to fair value is recorded 
fair values are determined based on quoted market values  discounted cash flows  or external appraisals  as applicable 
we review long lived assets for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flows can be identified 
the circumstances that would indicate potential impairment may include  but are not limited to  a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized  a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset 
in estimating cash flows  we project future volume levels for our different air express products in all geographic regions in which we do business 
adverse changes in these volume forecasts  or a shortfall of our actual volume compared with our projections  could result in our current aircraft capacity exceeding current or projected demand 
this situation would lead to an excess of a particular aircraft type  resulting in an aircraft impairment charge or a reduction of the expected life of an aircraft type thus resulting in increased depreciation expense 
during  we reevaluated the anticipated service lives of our boeing  boeing  and airbus a fleets  and as a result of this evaluation  increased the depreciable lives from to years and reduced the residual values from to of original cost 
this change did not have a material effect on our results of operations 
in december  we permanently removed from service a number of boeing  and mcdonnell douglas dc aircraft 
as a result of the actual and planned retirement of these aircraft  we conducted an impairment evaluation  which resulted in a million impairment charge during the fourth quarter of for these aircraft including the related engines and parts  million of which impacted the us domestic package segment and million of which impacted the international package segment 
this charge was classified in the caption other expenses on the income statement 
ups continues to operate all of its other aircraft and continues to experience positive cash flow  and no impairments of aircraft were recognized in or income taxes we operate in numerous countries around the world and are subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions 
we estimate our annual effective income tax rate based on statutory income tax rates in these jurisdictions and take into consideration items that are treated differently for financial reporting and tax purposes 
the process of estimating our effective income tax rate involves judgments related to tax planning and expectations regarding future events  including the impact of adjustments  if any  resulting from the resolution of audits of open tax years by the internal revenue service or other taxing authorities 
we recognize deferred tax assets for items that will generate tax deductions or credits in future years 
realization of deferred tax assets requires sufficient future taxable income subject to any carry forward limitations in the applicable jurisdictions 
we make judgments regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets based  in part  on estimates of future taxable income 
a valuation allowance is recognized if  based on the weight of the available evidence  it is more likely than not likelihood of more than percent that some portion  or all  of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
income tax related contingency matters also affect our effective income tax rate 
in this regard  we make judgments related to the identification and quantification of income tax related contingency matters 

index to financial statements during the third quarter of  we recognized a million reduction of income tax expense related to favorable developments with certain us federal tax contingency matters involving us operations 
during  the resolution of tax matters with the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities produced reductions in income tax expense of million 
forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other parts of this report contain forward looking statements about matters that inherently are difficult to predict 
the words believes  expects  anticipates  we see  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
these statements include statements regarding our intent  belief and current expectations about our strategic direction  prospects and future results 
we have described some of the important factors that affect these statements as we discussed each subject 
forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  and certain factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements 
risk factors the following are some of the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expected results described in our forward looking statements the effect of general economic and other conditions in the markets in which we operate  both in the united states and internationally 
our operations in international markets are also affected by currency exchange and inflation risks 
the impact of competition on a local  regional  national  and international basis 
our competitors include the postal services of the us and other nations  various motor carriers  express companies  freight forwarders  air couriers and others 
our industry is undergoing rapid consolidation  and the combining entities are competing aggressively for business 
the impact of complex and stringent aviation  transportation  environmental  labor  employment and other governmental laws and regulations  and the impact of new laws and regulations that may result from increased security concerns following the events of september  our failure to comply with applicable laws  ordinances or regulations could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations 
strikes  work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees 
such actions may affect our ability to meet our customers needs  and customers may do more business with competitors if they believe that such actions may adversely affect our ability to provide service 
we may face permanent loss of customers if we are unable to provide uninterrupted service 
the terms of future collective bargaining agreements also may affect our competitive position and results of operations 
possible disruption of supplies  or an increase in the prices  of gasoline  diesel and jet fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicles as a result of war or other factors 
we require significant quantities of fuel and are exposed to the commodity price risk associated with variations in the market price for petroleum products 
cyclical and seasonal fluctuations in our operating results due to decreased demand for our services
