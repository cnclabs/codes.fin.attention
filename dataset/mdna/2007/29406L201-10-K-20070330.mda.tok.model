item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations together with the selected consolidated financial data section of this annual report on form k and our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing in this report 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by the forward looking statements due to important factors including  but not limited to  those set forth in part i  item a risk factors appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a developer  owner  and operator of renewable energy production facilities 
our goal is to produce energy that is beyond renewable  which we define as energy that not only uses waste materials instead of precious resources  but energy that is also clean  reliable  and cost effective 
since inception  we have been an independent developer and owner of non commodity  renewable and alternative energy facilities that produce biofuels or electricity by utilizing fuel derived from our waste management processes or alternative fuel sources such as waste coal 
such fuel sources generally are not subject to the pricing and market fluctuations of commodity fuels and  in some instances  are considered renewable energy fuels 
we have developed three anaerobic digesters  seven hydroelectric plants  two municipal waste projects  and three waste coal fired generating facilities 
we sold or transferred all of these projects either in development or after completion 
we currently have two principal business units  buzzard power corporation and microgy  inc  which are described below 
we believe that microgy represents a substantial portion of the future potential growth of environmental power corporation and  as such  we are investing substantially all of our available resources  in terms of both financial and human capital  to take advantage of microgy s opportunities 
buzzard power corporation buzzard power corporation  referred to as buzzard  is a subsidiary of our wholly owned subsidiary  epc corporation 
buzzard leases its generating facility from scrubgrass generating company  lp the scrubgrass plant  referred to as scrubgrass  located on a acre site in venango county  pennsylvania  is an approximate megawatt waste coal fired electric generating station 
microgy  inc microgy is a developer of renewable energy facilities for the production and commercial application of methane rich biogas from agricultural and food industry wastes 
the biogas can be used to produce pipeline grade methane or marketable biogas  liquefied natural gas  or lng  renewable electrical energy or thermal energy  as well as other useful by products 
microgy s systems utilize a proven european biogas production technology that we believe is superior to other such technologies 
microgy owns the exclusive north american license to this technology 
in addition  microgy has developed  for itself  significant engineering  construction and process knowledge regarding these systems 
in addition to the value generated from the production and sale of renewable gas  we believe that our facilities can generate additional environmental benefits with significant economic and social value by providing a valuable waste management solution for farms and other producers of organic wastes  such as those in the food industry 
federal and state agencies either have passed or may be in the process of passing regulations that require concentrated animal feeding operations  referred to as afos  to implement changes to their current waste management practices 
we believe that these increasingly stringent environmental regulations will be another significant factor driving adoption of our systems 
we believe that a number of factors  including high energy prices  increasing desire for renewable energy sources and more stringent environmental and waste management requirements  will continue to provide a favorable market environment for our business 

table of contents microgy holdings  llc was formed in as a subsidiary of environmental power corporation in connection with the million tax exempt debt financing we completed in november relating to the construction and operations of four rng facilities in texas 
this entity and its subsidiaries are included in the microgy segment 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others discussed in note b to our consolidated annual financial statements appearing in this report  involve more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
sale and lease back accounting our sale of scrubgrass power corporation  the original developer of the scrubgrass facility  was not treated as a sale for financial accounting purposes 
this was originally due to the existence of an option that enabled us to reacquire buzzard  then a wholly owned subsidiary of scrubgrass power corporation and owner of the right to lease the scrubgrass facility  for a substantial portion of its commercial operation 
we exercised our option and reacquired buzzard in so that we would have the right to lease the scrubgrass facility 
the then proposed lease provided buzzard with a fair market value purchase option to acquire the scrubgrass facility at the end of the lease 
this option meant that we had retained substantial risks or rewards of ownership of scrubgrass 
therefore  we were not permitted to recognize the sale until  when we agreed to a modification to the proposed form of lease and relinquished the fair market value purchase option 
accordingly  we removed from our consolidated financial statements the gross assets and liabilities of the scrubgrass facility and reported a gain of million arising from the sale of scrubgrass 
however  due to our anticipated involvement with the lease  we were required to defer our gain over the year minimum lease term  which commenced on june  in connection with the operating lease  we incurred aggregate costs of million to reacquire buzzard  the lessee of scrubgrass  and capitalized these costs as the value of our lease rights 
the value of our lease rights is also being amortized over the year minimum lease term  which commenced on june  lease expense recognition buzzard has a long term lease agreement for scrubgrass  which commenced on june   and continues for a year minimum lease term 
under the terms of the lease  buzzard  as lessee  is required to pay the lessor a specified base rent  which consists of all of the lessor s debt service  scheduled equity repayment  base return on equity and related expenses 
buzzard is also required to pay the lessor an additional rent of of the net cash flows buzzard receives from the operation of scrubgrass 
the lessor s specified base rent increases over time and is based on a schedule that follows the expected receipt of revenues 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  buzzard is required to aggregate the estimated lease payments over the life of the lease and recognize them on a straight line basis over the year lease term 
as such  during the earlier years of the lease agreement  a portion of buzzard s lease expenses will be paid in cash and a portion will be recorded as a liability 
as of december   we have a deferred lease expense of million recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
this liability represents accumulated lease expenses recorded on a straight line basis in previous years that have not been paid to the lessor 
after  cash payments to the lessor will exceed the lease expenses recorded on a straight line basis and the accrued lease expense will be decreased and reach zero by the end of the lease term 
this straight line accounting treatment of certain lease expenses under the scrubgrass lease resulted in the recognition of non cash revenue of million in the scrubgrass lease resulted in recognition of 
table of contents non cash lease expense of  and million for the years ended december   and respectively 
additional rents are not part of this straight line basis and are recorded as incurred 
our subsidiary  epc corporation  which owns of buzzard s common stock  is not liable for future lease rental payments 
buzzard s stock is pledged as security  and buzzard is only liable for future lease rental payments to the extent buzzard receives cash receipts from future power generation revenues 
as of december   without regard to straight line lease accounting  we estimate the future minimum lease payments over the remaining base term of the scrubgrass lease are as follows future minimum scrubgrass lease payments thereafter total our lease expense components  which are discussed in the following paragraphs  consist of specified base rent payments  calculated on a straight line basis  and additional rent 
as noted above  buzzard  as lessee  is required to pay the lessor a specified base rent  which consists of all of the lessor s debt service  scheduled equity repayment  base return on equity and related expenses 
the lessor s debt service largely consists of debt obligations with variable interest rates 
therefore  in order to calculate future minimum lease payments  we estimate an average interest rate which will be payable in the future for each variable rate debt obligation 
since actual interest rates will differ from these estimates  our actual lease expense reported in future periods will differ from these estimates  and the differences may be material 
in order to calculate the straight line lease expense  we take the total of the estimated future minimum lease payments over the lease term and divide this total by the lease term to get an annual lease expense 
the annual lease expense is then compared to the total amount projected to be paid to the lessor in each period  and the difference is reported as a deferred lease expense in our consolidated financial statements 
any differences between actual lease billings and projected lease billings  which principally result from variances between actual interest rates and projected interest rates  are reported as a lease expense in the current period 
buzzard is also required to pay the lessor an additional rent  in addition to the specified base rent  which additional rent represents of the net cash flows buzzard receives from the operation of scrubgrass 
we estimate and accrue additional rent in the accounting period when earned 
however  because additional rent is based on cash flows and not earnings  we are required to determine when the cash flows were generated from operations  which is inherently subjective 
lease expenses may also cause large fluctuations between accounting periods in our reported earnings since the specified base rent and additional rent are not directly related to our earnings 
additional rent is not part of the straight line lease expense calculation 
revenue recognition we record power generation revenues when electricity is transmitted to the utility under the terms of the underlying power sales agreement 
however  under the terms of our long term power sales agreement  or psa  with pennsylvania electric company  or penelec  the same annual generation of electricity is expected to result in significant increases in revenues over the life of the psa 
for various reasons  including the requirement that all the power generated by the scrubgrass facility be sold to one customer  we account for power generation revenues under the lease accounting rules as if the power sales agreement were a sublease to this customer 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we are therefore required to aggregate the expected revenue to be received over the life of the power sales agreement and recognize it on a straight line basis over the year lease term 
as such  during the early years of the power sales agreement with penelec  a portion of our power generation revenues will be received in cash and a portion will be recorded to an asset 
however  because we cannot predict whether revenues would be collected over the entire 
table of contents life of the power sales agreement  and  absent revenues  whether buzzard would be able to perform under the lease  the recognition of revenue on a straight line basis has been limited to the recognition of lease expense on a straight line basis 
as a result  net income is not affected by straight line lease and revenue accounting 
as of december   we have accrued power generation revenue of million recorded on our consolidated balance sheet  which is equal in amount to the deferred lease expense 
this asset represents accumulated revenue recorded on a straight line basis in previous years that has not been collected from penelec 
this straight line accounting treatment of power generation revenue under the psa with penelec resulted in non cash expense of million in and non cash revenues of  and million for the years ended december    and respectively 
after  we expect that our cash receipts from penelec will exceed the revenues recorded on a straight line basis and the accrued power generation revenue will be decreased and reach zero by the end of the lease term 
future cash collections from power generation revenue may vary from the projections used to aggregate the expected revenue to be received over the life of the power sales agreement  which we recognize on a straight line basis over the year lease term 
method of accounting for contracts revenues and profits from our dairyland contracts  which appear as microgy revenues on our income statement  are generally recognized by applying percentages of completion for the period to the total estimated profits for the respective contracts 
percentage of completion is determined by relating the actual cost of the work performed to date to the current estimated total cost of the respective contracts 
when the estimate on a contract indicates a loss  our policy is to record the entire loss during the accounting period in which it is estimated 
in the ordinary course of business  at a minimum on a quarterly basis  we prepare updated estimates of the total forecasted revenue  cost and profit or loss for each contract 
the cumulative effect of revisions in estimates of the total forecasted revenue and costs during the course of the work is reflected in the accounting period in which the facts that caused the revision become known 
the financial impact of these revisions to any one contract is a function of both the amount of the revision and the percentage of completion of the contract 
an amount equal to the costs incurred is included in the total estimated revenue when realization is probable 
profit from unapproved change orders and claims is recorded in the period such amounts are resolved 
as of december   we have recognized a total loss on our dairyland contracts of approximately  in accordance with normal practice in the construction industry  we include in current assets and current liabilities amounts related to construction contracts realizable and payable over a period in excess of one year 
billings in excess of revenues or deferred contract revenues represent the excess of billings to date over the amount of contract costs and profits or contract revenue recognized to date on the percentage of completion accounting method on certain contracts 
unbilled work represents the excess of contract costs and profits or contract revenue recognized to date on the percentage of completion accounting method over billings to date on the remaining contracts 
unbilled revenues and billings in excess of revenues related to our contracts at december   and  consisted of the following accounting for contracts december  december  december  billings in excess of revenues unbilled revenues the company records revenues for operation and maintenance of the facilities at the dairyland sites which appear as microgy revenue on the income statement 
operations and maintenance revenues are recorded as services are provided and billed on a monthly basis 
notes receivable during  we completed construction of the digesters at five star dairy and wild rose dairy 
during  we completed construction at the norswiss dairy 
each digester has begun operations 
the sales price for each digester is million 
we will be paid from the cash flow from the sale of gas generated under the 
table of contents applicable biogas supply agreement between the digester owner and dairyland  which extends through years after the sale for the facility to which it relates 
we will be paid up to a maximum of million plus interest at per annum  which is evidenced by three notes of approximately million each 
accordingly  we have valued these notes based on our current estimate of the future cash flow stream from the sale of gas  which we estimate will be million 
we will continue to evaluate the estimated operating cash flows from these digesters that support the ability to realize these notes and make further adjustments  if required 
please see the discussion of these notes set forth below for more information 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as our deferred gain and lease rights  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had recorded a deferred income tax asset of million and a valuation allowance of million against our gross deferred income tax assets  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our net operating loss carry forwards before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
intangible assets in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the most significant changes made by sfas no 
are goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will be tested for impairment at least annually  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will no longer be amortized to income  and the amortization period of intangible assets with finite lives will no longer be limited to forty years 
the provisions of sfas were applied to the goodwill and intangible assets of million acquired in the microgy acquisition 
we did not have goodwill or intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet prior to the microgy acquisition 
we adopted sfas on january  and completed the transitional impairment testing in june and the required testing annually through december  we assessed the implied fair value of the reporting unit by using a projected discounted cash flow analysis 
given consideration of these factors  we concluded that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount of its net assets and  thus  goodwill was not impaired as of december  stock based compensation expense the employee stock based compensation expense recognized under fasr and presented in the pro forma disclosure required under fas was determined using the black scholes option valuation model 
option valuation models require the input of subjective assumptions and these assumptions can vary over time 

table of contents employee stock based compensation expense recognized in was calculated based on awards ultimately expected to vest and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
fas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
a forfeiture rate of to is applied to the stock based compensation expense  determined through historical experience of employee stock options 
the company primarily bases its determination of expected volatility and expected term through its assessment of the historical volatility of its common stock and historical exercise of stock options and post vesting termination activity 
in october of  microgy entered a business development agreement with cargill would receive environmental power warrants in exchange for the identification of anaerobic digester projects 
the company s accounting policy for equity instruments issued to consultants and vendors in exchange for goods and services follows the provisions of eitf  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services and eitf  accounting recognition for certain transactions involving equity instruments granted to other than employees 
the measurement date for the fair value of the equity instruments issued is determined at the earlier of i the date at which a commitment for performance by the consultant or vendor is reached or ii the date at which the consultant or vendors performance is complete 
in the case of equity instruments issued to consultants  the fair value of the equity instrument is recognized over the term of the consulting agreement 
in accordance to eitf  an asset acquired in exchange for the issuance of fully vested  nonforfeitable equity instruments should not be presented or classified as an offset to equity on the grantors balance sheet once the equity instrument is granted for accounting purposes 
accordingly  the company records the fair value of nonforfeitable common stock issued for future consulting services as prepaid services in its consolidated balance sheet 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and for the year ended december   we had a net loss of million  or a loss of per common share  compared to a net loss of million  or a loss of per common share  for the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to a decrease in total revenues of million and a million increase in non cash compensation 
a charge of million due to the accounting for the beneficial conversion feature of our series a preferred stock issued in november  is presented as a loss available to common shareholders  and not included in net loss 
revenues decreased by million  or  to million for  as compared to million for the same period in although billed power generation revenues at buzzard increased by million to million in from million in due to an increase in the capacity rate and a contractual increase in the billable power rate  accrued power generation revenues decreased by million to a million reduction in revenues from a  addition to revenue in  as discussed below 
buzzard operated at of capacity for  compared to of capacity for microgy s revenues  primarily relating to its first three projects  decreased to million in from million in costs and expenses remained flat at million for the twelve months ended december   as compared to million for the same period in this small increase was primarily due to increased lease expense of million  increased operating expenses at buzzard of  and in general and administrative expenses of million 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in costs of goods sold at microgy of million 
the increases in general and administrative expenses resulted from an increase in non cash compensation  additional staff expansion  as well as associated professional fees affiliated with increased operations 
other income increased to  in  as compared to other income of  in this increase was attributable to an increase in interest income of  as a result of higher cash balances 
this increase in interest income was partially offset by a  increase in interest expense due to more debt obligations in the current year 

table of contents we have two primary business segments  buzzard and microgy 
the results of operations for these business segments  and all other segments  which is comprised of parent company expenses and non current business segments  are discussed below 
buzzard buzzard had a pre tax loss of million for the year ended december   compared to pre tax loss of million for this increased loss is primarily attributable to a  increase in interest expense  due to the working capital loan holding a higher average balance in the current year 
total revenues remained relatively flat 
revenues at buzzard  which are comprised of billed power generation revenues and accrued power generation revenues  remained constant at million in buzzard operated at of capacity in  compared to of capacity for and billed power rates increased by pursuant to the terms of our psa with penelec 
consequently  billed power revenues increased million 
however  accrued power generation revenues decreased by million to a million reduction to revenues in  as compared to a  addition to revenues in the accrued power generation revenues result from the fasb accounting treatment of the scrubgrass lease 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  we are required to treat buzzard s psa with penelec as a lease  aggregate the minimum lease payments expected to be received over its life  and recognize it on a straight line basis over the year lease term 
however  we have limited the recognition of accrued power revenues to the recognition of the deemed minimum payments of the facility lease so that we do not recognize any profits early related to executory costs or payment for goods and services other than solely for the right to use the facility 
this minimum lease payment component is higher in the early years  decreases in the subsequent years  and reverses itself in the later years of the psa 
this adjustment has no effect on pre tax income because it is completely offset by an accrued lease expense 
total costs and expenses at buzzard remained flat at million in compared to million in operating expenses including fuel and maintenance costs remained relatively flat million in compared to million in the prior year 
lease expenses increased by million due an increases in interest and principal payments of million 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in accrued lease expenses of million  relating to the straight line accounting treatment of the lease of the buzzard facility 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million due primarily to a million decrease in the allocation of corporate expenses and a  decrease in professional services 
microgy pre tax losses at microgy increased slightly to million in from million in the increase in loss resulted from decreases in revenues of million  partially offset by decreases in costs and expenses of million 
microgy s revenues consist of product revenues related to the sale of anaerobic digestion facilities  operations and maintenance  or o m  revenues related to the management of certain facilities  and miscellaneous revenues including carbon credits and tipping fees 
total revenues decreased to million in from million in product revenues decreased to million from million as we completed the third wisconsin facility in the third quarter of due to the shift in our business strategy to build  own  and operate larger rng facilities  we experienced a drop in product sales as we stopped selling facilities to external customers and focused on building facilities for our own account 
o m revenues increased by  to  in from  in due to increased the operations and maintenance activities of the wisconsin facilities 
miscellaneous revenues decreased by  to  in from  in however  we were able to sell approximately  tons of carbon credits or greenhouse gas  or ghg  credits  relating to calendar years and  from the wisconsin facilities for gross proceeds of  we have joined the chicago climate exchange as a participant member and have had the three facilities ghg credits verified 
we expect to generate more revenue from the sale of such credits in the future 
table of contents microgy s cost of goods sold decreased by million to million in from million in construction costs decreased to  in from million in as we transitioned our business model from a sell and operate model to an own and operate model 
in  we experienced operating and start up costs of million compared to  in in  we also recorded a bad debt allowance of  on the notes receivable for the three wisconsin digesters 
the commercial terms of the initial projects are not indicative of the commercial terms for future projects 
the bad debt allowance on the notes relating to these projects would not be required were gas sold at current market prices 
however  in order to expedite the deployment of these initial projects and capture the benefits described above  we chose to accept certain commercial terms and incur certain expenses that we do not expect to incur on future projects 
for example  for each of these initial projects  dairyland is to purchase  for a thirty year period  the biogas generated by the digester at a below market price of per mmbtu 
in addition  initial operating costs of these first facilities are higher than we expect for future projects 
as we build additional projects  further implement operational infrastructure and gain operating experience  we expect these costs to decline 
general and administrative expenses for microgy increased million to million for  as compared to million for this increase is primarily due to increases in overhead costs of million  primarily related to professional fees and salaries  increases in development expenses increased of  and increases in payroll and benefit expenses of  all of these expenses are related to the continued development and expansion of our microgy segment 
all other segments all other segments are comprised of corporate expenses and non current business segments 
we did not have any revenues in these segments for we had a pre tax loss in this segment of million in compared to a pre tax loss of million in the increase in pre tax loss is primarily due to increases in non cash compensation expense of million  increases in professional fees of  and decreases in our corporate allocation to our other segments of  which result in higher costs at the corporate level 
the allocations are based upon monthly estimates of time and resources spent on various segment activities 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in pension expense of  and salary expense of  in  the non cash compensation is based upon the fas r accounting of options  resulting in expenses of million 
in  the accounting for performance based options and stock grants resulted in expenses of  in because there is uncertainty regarding performance based options  including vesting and stock price  we applied variable accounting treatment to those options in when options vest or if it is highly likely that they will vest  we expense the options based upon the then current stock price 
these options are re valued quarterly and any increase or decrease in value is charged to compensation expense 
please see note i to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this report for more information 
we had other income in this segment of  for  compared to income of  for the increase in other income is primarily due to increases in interest income of  partially offset by increases in interest expenses of  related to the arclight loan  as described in note g to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
comparison of the years ended december  and for the year ended december   we had a net loss of million  or a loss of per common share  compared to a net loss of million  or a loss of per common share  for the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to a decrease in total revenues of million and an increase in total costs and expenses of million  as described in more detail below 
revenues decreased by million  or  to million for  as compared to million for the same period in buzzard operated at of capacity for  compared to of capacity for 
table of contents billed power generation revenues at buzzard decreased by million to million in from million in due to a decrease in the capacity rate and a contractual decrease in the billable power rate 
additionally  accrued power generation revenues decreased by million to  from million  as discussed below 
microgy s revenues  relating to its first three projects  increased to million in from million in costs and expenses increased by million  or  to million for the twelve months ended december   as compared to million for the same period in this increase was primarily due to increases in general and administrative costs of million and in costs of goods sold at microgy of million 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in non cash compensation of million and in lease expenses of million 
the increases in general and administrative expenses resulted from additional staff expansion  as well as accruals for additional pension obligations  severance pay  and operating expense reserves 
other income increased to  in  as compared to other expenses of  in this increase was attributable to both an increase in interest income  as our cash balances increased from our public offerings  and to a decrease in interest expense  as we paid down the balance on the arclight loan 
we have two primary business segments  buzzard and microgy 
the results of operations for these business segments  and all other segments  which is comprised of parent company expenses and non current business segments  are discussed below 
buzzard buzzard had a pre tax loss of million for the year ended december   compared to pre tax income of million for this loss is primarily attributable to a million decrease in power generation revenues  as described below 
total costs and expenses remained relatively flat 
revenues at buzzard  which are comprised of power generation revenues  decreased to million in from million in buzzard operated at of capacity in  compared to of capacity for the decrease was also driven by a decrease in billed power rates pursuant to the terms of buzzard s psa with penelec 
additionally  accrued power generation revenues decreased by million to  in from million in the accrued power generation revenues result from the fasb accounting treatment of the scrubgrass lease 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  we are required to treat the psa with penelec as a lease  aggregate the minimum lease payments expected to be received over its life  and recognize it on a straight line basis over the year lease term 
however  we have limited the recognition of accrued power revenues to the recognition of the deemed minimum payments of the facility lease so that we do not recognize any profits early related to executory costs or payment for goods and services other than solely for the right to use the facility 
this minimum lease payment component is higher in the early years  decreases in the subsequent years  and reverses itself in the later years of the psa 
this adjustment has no effect on pre tax income because it is completely offset by an accrued lease expense 
total operating costs at buzzard for remained flat at million compared to million in lease expenses decreased by million due to a decrease in accrued lease expense of million and a decrease of million in principal and equity rent payments 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in interest payments of million 
microgy pre tax losses at microgy increased million to million in from million in this increase resulted from increases in operating expenses associated with the construction of microgy s first three projects  as well as increased development efforts in california and the southwestern united states 

table of contents microgy s revenues increased slightly to million in from million in we are recognizing revenues associated with the construction of the first three of the projects on which we have commenced construction under our relationship with dairyland using the percentage of completion method 
when the estimate on a contract indicates a loss  our policy is to record the entire loss during the accounting period in which it is estimated 
two of the projects are over complete and the third is over complete 
microgy s cost of goods sold increased by million to million in from million in construction costs increased to million in from million in in  we recorded operating and start up costs of  and a bad debt allowance of  relating to the notes on the first three dairyland projects 
these first three projects represent the initial steps in our strategy to commercialize our licensed technology 
as such  we have expected and incurred substantial start up  engineering  and construction costs of that we do not expect to have to incur in future projects 
the two completed digesters have been producing gas  and are meeting our initial gas production expectations 
given the nature of the emerging markets in which we operate  we felt it prudent to expedite the deployment of our initial projects in order to validate our technology and showcase the capabilities of our facilities 
we believe that by pursuing this strategy we have successfully accomplished our intended goals 
we have begun operations on two facilities  are completing construction on our third  and have demonstrated gas production in excess of target levels 
by launching these projects we have demonstrated that the leading european technology at the core of our facilities works in the united states  and have moved next generation anaerobic digestion power projects in the united states from the conceptual to the operational phase 
in addition  we believe that the launch of our first project has generated substantial interest in our technology and our company  laying the groundwork for future growth and increased shareholder value 
the commercial terms of the initial projects are not indicative of the commercial terms for future projects 
the bad debt allowance on the notes relating to these projects would not be required were gas sold at current market prices 
however  in order to expedite the deployment of these initial projects and capture the benefits described above  we chose to accept certain commercial terms and incur certain expenses that we do not expect to incur on future projects

as we build additional projects  further implement operational infrastructure and gain operating experience  we expect these costs to decline 
general and administrative expenses for microgy increased million to million for  as compared to million for this increase is primarily due to increases in payroll and benefit expenses of million during the period  due to the additional staff needed for the growth of microgy  in travel and entertainment expenses of  and in professional fees of  in each case as compared to the same period in all other segments all other segments are comprised of corporate expenses and non current business segments 
we did not have any revenues in these segments for we had a pre tax loss in this segment of million in compared to a pre tax loss of million in the decrease in pre tax loss is primarily due to a decrease in non cash compensation expense of million 
this decrease was offset by increases in payroll and benefit expenses of million  due partially to severance expenses  and in professional services of  due partially to legal and accounting services 
the accounting for performance based options and stock grants resulted in expenses of  in and million in please see note i to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this report for more information 
because there is uncertainty regarding performance based options  including vesting and stock 
table of contents price  we apply variable accounting treatment to these options 
when options vest or if it is highly likely that they will vest  we expense the options based upon the then current stock price 
these options are re valued quarterly and any increase or decrease in value is charged to compensation expense 
we had other income in this segment of  for  compared to expenses of  for the increase in other income is primarily due to increases in interest income of  and a decrease in interest expenses of  for  due to the fact that we have continued to make repayments on the principal balance of the arclight loan  as described in note g to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
quarterly results of operations note n to the consolidated financial statement included in this report sets forth items from our statements of operations for the eight quarters ended december   as well as that data expressed as a percentage of our total revenues 
this data has been derived from unaudited financial statements that  in the opinion of management  include all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of the information

we believe that period to period comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
the trends discussed in the period to period comparisons above generally apply to the results of operations for our eight most recent quarters 
we expect to experience significant fluctuations in future quarterly operating results that may be caused by many factors  including  among other things  the progress of microgy s business plan  the effects of competition  market acceptance of our products  the mix of our products and services sold  demand for our products or the timing of customer acceptance of our products  changes in the level of our operating expenses  general economic conditions and the factors set forth in part i  item a risk factors appearing elsewhere in this report

the proceeds of the bond offering will provide debt financing for four proposed renewable natural gas facilities in texas being developed by microgy

the following table describes our debt obligations as of december  and december  secured promissory notes payable and other borrowings tax exempt bond financing  including accrued interest arclight note payable  including accrued interest sunnyside project obligations vehicle loan capital leases total scrubgrass debt obligations buzzard and the lessor have various debt obligations related to scrubgrass 
under the terms of the scrubgrass lease  buzzard is required to pay the principal  interest and fees for the lessor s debt obligations as a base lease payment 
as such  buzzard is committed to pay all of the scrubgrass debt obligations as either a debt or lease obligation 
scrubgrass had the following debt obligations as of december  and december  description of the obligation balance at december  balance at december  interest rate buzzard s lease obligations maturity tax exempt bonds   quoted bond rates buzzard s debt obligations maturity working capital loan  libor total because we are not required to fund buzzard s operating losses  including payments on lease obligations  or otherwise invest further from sources outside of the scrubgrass plant  buzzard s lease obligations for the lessor s debt are not reported in our consolidated financial statements

sunnyside contingent obligations we had contingent obligations of million on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  the contingent obligations were principally expenses for the sale of our sunnyside project which were payable upon collection of certain obligations from the purchasers of sunnyside 
on april   we received aggregate proceeds of million from the purchasers of sunnyside and resolved litigation by executing a binding settlement agreement 
in this agreement  we were formally released from contingent obligations of  we have also been released by the statute of limitations or the terms of the underlying agreements from additional contingent obligations of  we reported the settlement proceeds of million and the released liabilities of  as other income in our consolidated financial statements for 
table of contents because of the terms of this settlement agreement  which terms represented a substantial compromise of our previous claims against the purchasers of sunnyside  we are presently considering our rights and obligations with respect to the remaining contingent obligations of  the unsettled contingent obligations will remain recorded in our consolidated financial statements until the statute of limitations for any legal action relating thereto runs out after march outlook operations the following forward looking information concerning our results of operations for the full year is being compared to our historical results of operations for buzzard power generation revenues are expected to remain relatively flat in as a result of the straight line accounting treatment of revenue under the power sales agreement 
billed revenues are expected to increase by due to increased power rates 
this increase will be offset by a decrease in the accrued power generation revenues 
we also expect the facility to run at a lower capacity due a required maintenance shut down in the second quarter 
operating expenses are expected to increase slightly in primarily due to increases the planned outage expenses and other maintenance expenses 
lease expenses are expected to increase slightly in due to increases in scheduled principal and equity payments 
these increases will be partially offset by decreases in the accrued lease expenses related to the straight line accounting treatment of the lease 
the scrubgrass project has operated at expected levels of availability  and we believe that the prospects for the scrubgrass facility are sound 
however  the lessor of the facility has projected that buzzard may have a shortfall in revenues available to make certain rental payments which become due commencing in june with arclight s assent  buzzard and the lessor have entered into a forbearance agreement effective through july  and the parties have begun exploratory discussions regarding mutually acceptable options 
possible options include the restructuring of the lease agreement for the scrubgrass facility and other agreements to which buzzard is party 
we have reviewed the lessor s projections and have made suggestions that we believe would avoid the projected shortfall and avoid a default 
however  we do not control the management of the scrubgrass plant  and these suggestions may not be implemented 
our discussions with the lessor and arclight regarding this matter have been constructive  and we are hopeful that a mutually acceptable outcome will be reached 
nevertheless  in the event that the parties are not able to reach agreement on a restructuring of the lease agreement and the projections prove to be valid  the missed payments would constitute an event of default by buzzard under the lease agreement  unless the missed payments are otherwise cured 
a default by buzzard under the lease agreement is without recourse against environmental power 
microgy we expect increased revenues from microgy in  as we expect to generate revenues from our huckabay ridge project in texas 
our revenues related to the operations and maintenance of the wisconsin facilities are expected to increase slightly 
we also expect to generate revenues from the sale of ghg credits 
although we do not expect to record any costs of goods sold related to the construction of facilities that we sold under our old business model  our operating expenses will increase slightly 
the operating expenses will be related to the operations of our rng facilities and to the management of the wisconsin facilities 

table of contents general and administrative expenses are expected to remain relatively flat 
we will continue to incur substantial costs associated with the development and growth of the business 
all other segments we do not expect significant changes in general and administrative expenses related to all other segments 
cash flow outlook during  we expect to fund our business activities principally from available cash balances  investment earnings  raising additional funds through debt and or equity financings by environmental power or microgy and project specific financing  to the extent available 
the requirement for additional financing will be in direct proportion to the number of projects on which we begin construction over the next twelve months 
we do not expect to receive cash from the operations of buzzard  insofar as any available cash will be used to repay interest and principal on the arclight loan 
on december   our unrestricted cash balance was million  as compared to million as of december  in addition  our restricted cash balances were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
as discussed further under investing activities  buzzard is allowed to spend restricted cash contributed to the scrubgrass maintenance fund to fund the cost of major equipment overhauls at scrubgrass  subject to certain restrictions  and to use restricted cash representing the remaining proceeds of our million tax exempt bond financing to construct up to four planned rng facilities in texas  subject to certain restrictions 
we believe that our current cash balance will be sufficient to fund our minimum lease  debt obligations  current construction commitments  and our corporate overhead requirements 
however  our current cash balance and our cash flows from operations will not be sufficient to fund the construction of currently planned facilities in the absence of obtaining additional financing 
our present business strategy generally anticipates direct or indirect participation in the ownership of all facilities 
we anticipate that project or corporate financing may be obtained in the form of a credit facility with one or more lenders  the sale of tax exempt or taxable bonds to investors  equity  other financing  or a combination of the foregoing 
however  we cannot assure you that microgy or any other prospective facility owner will be able to secure project or other financing in the amount required to fulfill any development or construction requirements  that financing will be obtained in time to meet such requirements  or that any such proposed financing  if obtained  will be on terms favorable to microgy or any other prospective project owner 
furthermore  to the extent microgy or an affiliate is a direct or indirect owner of facilities  microgy will need to obtain substantial additional financing to allow it to develop and construct such facilities 
while we may also seek debt or equity financing at the parent company level in order to fund microgy s operations  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining such financing or that  if obtained  such financing will be on terms favorable to us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our most significant market risk exposure is changing interest rates  which may affect our short term investments  debt and certain of our lease expenses 
in addition  we expect to become increasingly exposed to commodity price risk relating to our gas production 
we offer the following information about these market risks short term investments we invest cash balances that are in excess of our normal operating requirements in short term investments generally with maturities of three months or less 
because of the short duration of these investments  we do not believe our short term investments are subject to material market risk 

table of contents debt we have borrowings that bear interest at variable rates that are based on libor 
we monitor market conditions for interest rates and  from time to time  enter into interest rate swaps to manage our interest payments 
the interest rate swaps have the effect of converting the variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings for specified time periods 
lease expense as a lease cost of the scrubgrass plant  buzzard is required to fund the lessor s debt service which consists primarily of borrowings which bear interest at variable rates based on either quoted bond rates or libor 
the manager of scrubgrass monitors market conditions for interest rates and  from time to time  enters into interest rate swaps to manage the interest payments for scrubgrass 
the interest rate swaps have the effect of converting the variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings for specified time periods 
as of december   the aggregate outstanding balance of the lessor s variable rate debt obligations  which are passed along to us as a lease expense  was  based on these balances  an immediate change of one percent for the variable interest rates would cause a change in lease expense of  our objective in maintaining these variable rate borrowings is to achieve a lower overall cost when compared to fixed rate borrowings 
we believe the lessor has the same objective for maintaining its variable rate borrowings 
commodity price risk as microgy begins to focus a significant portion of its development efforts on multi digester projects for the production of gas for sale as a commodity  we will become increasingly exposed to market risk with respect to the commodity pricing applicable to our gas production 
realized commodity prices received for such production are expected to be primarily driven by spot prices applicable to natural gas 
historically  natural gas prices have been volatile  and we expect such volatility to continue 
fluctuations in the commodity price of natural gas may have a materially adverse impact on the profitability of some of our projects  particularly where we do not have a long term contract for the sale of the project s output at a fixed or predictable price 
at such time as microgy s projects begin to produce commercial quantities of gas for sale as a commodity  we intend to explore various strategies  including hedging transactions and the like  in order to mitigate the associated commodity price risk 
in connection with our texas bond financing  we are required to maintain certain gas price protection arrangements for the gas output of our texas facilities 
in connection with this obligation  microgy holdings llc has entered into an agreement to sell up to  mmbtus per day of the output of our huckabay ridge facility to a counterparty under a collared product pricing arrangement for a term of months beginning april and ending in october of in addition  as previously announced  microgy inc has also entered into a long term fixed price arrangement with pg e to purchase the gas produced from our planned california facilities in an amount up to  mmbtus per day 
substrate costs we are reliant on substrate for the operation of our digesters 
we are currently unable to forecast the prices or supply of substrate  and are exposed to market risk relating to the cost and availability of these materials 
substrate costs are driven by industry supply and demand  including competition by other users and recyclers of these materials  transportation costs  weather  and many other factors 
fluctuations in the availability or cost of substrate are expected and could have a materially adverse effect on the profitability of our investments 
in the absence of useable substrate or substrate of sufficient quality  our anaerobic digester facilities would operate less efficiently  which would materially and adversely affect our overall profitability
