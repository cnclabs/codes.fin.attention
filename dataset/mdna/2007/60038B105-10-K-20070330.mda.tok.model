item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
general we were formed as a delaware limited liability company on december   and organized and began operations on january  inception date 
we were converted into a delaware corporation on april  when all of the outstanding equity interests of the limited liability company were converted into shares of common stock of the corporation 
on december   we acquired gecko energy technologies  llc gecko  a fuel cell company 
overview we are engaged in the development of hydrogen batteries for use primarily in portable electronic devices for the military  medical  industrial and consumer markets 
we are developing this technology in partnership with corporate and government entities 
hydrogen on demand is the trademarked name for our proprietary hydrogen energy storage and delivery technology 
powerskin is the trademarked name for gecko s fuel cell technology 
as a result of our acquisition of gecko  our combined technology is based on the culmination of work reflected in more than patents granted or pending that collectively provide us with significant patent protection in planar fuel cells and the system and fuel blend technology used to convert sodium borohydride to hydrogen energy for use in portable electronic device applications 
our losses have resulted primarily from costs associated with product development and research and development activities as well as non cash amortization of preferred stock and non cash charges related to the issuance of stock awards to employees and third parties 
as a result of planned expenditures in the areas of research  product development and marketing and additional non cash charges relating to stock awards  we expect to incur additional operating losses for the foreseeable future

we recorded  of revenues during the year ended december  compared with revenues of  in  a decrease of  revenues in both periods were earned from engineering and design 
while in the development stage  our revenues are expected to fluctuate from year to year with the timing of prototype development and design services 
in the near term  revenues are expected to be derived substantially from catalyst sales  up front license fees  research contracts with various federal  state and local agencies  collaborations with other companies  management services  and royalty payments or joint venture revenue from licensees or strategic partnerships 
revenues will be recognized in the period in which technology is delivered  licensing revenues are earned  or as services are performed

research and development expense 
research and development expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  the increase is primarily due to one time in process research and development charges of  related to the purchase of gecko in december this was slightly offset by increased cost reimbursements under programs with the department of energy 
interest expense 
net interest expense was  for the year ended december  compared to net interest expense of  for the year ended december   a decrease of  the decrease in net interest expense was caused mainly by reduced charges related to fewer conversions of convertible instruments into common stock during than in interest expense is comprised of interest on the series c preferred stock dividends  debenture principal  charges for beneficial conversion features  amortization of original issue discounts and issue costs on convertible debentures and preferred stock

reimbursements under the doe program totaled  and  for and  respectively 
interest expense 
net interest expense was  for the year ended december  compared to interest expense of  for the year ended december   a decrease of  the decrease in net interest expense was caused mainly by reduced charges for beneficial conversion features and fewer conversions of convertible instruments into common stock during than in interest expense is comprised of interest on the series c preferred stock dividend  debenture principal  charges for beneficial conversion features  amortization of original issue discounts and issue costs on convertible debentures and preferred stock

this program  if continued by the state in future years  may provide us with similar cash inflows each year if we continue to incur net operating losses 
liquidity and capital resources general since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through our initial public offering in august and private placements of equity and debt securities 
the net proceeds from our initial public offering totaled approximately million and we generated net proceeds from private placement transactions in and totaling million 
in  we received net proceeds of approximately million from a separate private placement transaction 
in april  we received net proceeds of approximately million for the issuance of redeemable series c preferred stock 
in may  we received proceeds of million in a private placement of series b preferred stock 
in february  we received net proceeds of million in a private placement of unsecured debentures 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and cash from our cost sharing agreements will be sufficient to fund our operations through the first half of we may raise additional funds through public or private financing  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
we cannot be assured that additional funding  if sought  will be available or will be on terms favorable to us 
further  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our failure to raise capital when needed may harm our business and operating results 
convertible debentures on november   we issued a million secured convertible debenture with a maturity date of september  in accordance with eitf application of issue no 
to certain convertible instruments and eitf accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios  we record a beneficial conversion feature bcf if the unsecured debentures are converted into common stock at a discount 
in  we converted million of the unsecured debentures in exchange for  shares of our common stock and recorded a bcf charge of  associated with the conversions 
in january and february of  we converted  of the unsecured debentures in exchange for  shares of our common stock and recorded a bcf charge of  associated with the conversion 
series c preferred stock on april   we consummated a private placement financing transaction with seven institutional and accredited investors pursuant to the terms of a securities purchase agreement with such investors 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  the investors paid million in cash for  shares of our redeemable series c preferred stock series c 
each series c share is convertible into shares of our common stock  at any time  at an initial conversion price equal to per share subject to adjustment based upon customary anti dilution provisions  or lower based upon the market price of our common stock during the ten trading days preceding conversion 
the shares of series c bear a cumulative dividend payable quarterly in shares of common stock or cash  at our option  and are junior to the series a preferred stock and series b preferred stock in liquidation preference 
the series c is subject to mandatory redemption by us three years after issuance and can be settled in cash or with our common stock 
as a result  the series c is recorded as a liability in accordance with fas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
additionally  we issued to the investors three year warrants to purchase an aggregate of million 
table of contents shares of our common stock at an exercise price equal to per share  subject to adjustment based on customary antidilution protections 
the warrants were valued at  at the date of issuance and were recorded as a discount to debt and as additional paid in capital and is being amortized as interest expense throughout the term of the series c or as they are converted  whichever comes first 
during and  we recorded  and  respectively for the amortization of the discount 
we amortize the financing fees incurred for the series c transactions throughout the term of the series c or as they are converted  whichever comes first 
under the series c purchase agreement with the investors  we are required to restrict funds for future dividends to be paid with respect to the series c 
as a result  these funds  which amounted to approximately  at issuance  were classified as restricted cash on the balance sheet 
according to the series c purchase agreement  as dividends are issued or paid  and conversions are executed  the restricted cash is released ratably to our non restricted cash accounts 
as of december   approximately million of the series c have been converted into  shares of our common stock and we have transferred  from the restricted cash account for the conversions that were executed 
as of december  and  we issued  and  shares valued at  and  respectively in satisfaction of the quarterly dividend payments with respect to series c 
total dividends of  and  which include dividends paid in cash and common stock  were recorded as interest expense during the year ended december  and  respectively  since the series c was recorded as a liability 
on february   we entered into agreements with each holder of series c pursuant to which we agreed  between the date of such agreement and june   deliver company interim conversion election notices as such term is defined in the certificate of designations of the series c to convert of such holder s shares of series c into shares of our common stock over a four month period  at our option 
as provided in the certificate of designations of the series c  the closing sale price for our common stock on the date immediately preceding the date of each company interim conversion election notice must be at least in excess of the conversion price if the applicable closing sale price is or less  or in excess of the conversion price if the applicable closing sale price is greater than  in order for us to cause such conversion 
as a result  these conversions would result in bcf charges in accordance with eitf application of issue no 
to certain convertible instruments and eitf accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios since the conversion price would be lower than the market price of our common stock on the date of the conversion 
series a and series b preferred stock on april   we consummated the first closing under a joint development arrangement with the dow chemical company dow 
in connection with the closing  we issued  shares of series a preferred stock series a to dow  each share of which was initially convertible into ten shares of our common stock 
as a result of the series a issuance in exchange for services rendered by dow in conjunction with the joint development arrangement  we recorded a non cash charge of  as product development expense based on the market value of the underlying common stock as of april  the series a has substantially the same rights of our common stock  therefore the series a was valued based on the closing price of our common stock on april  the purpose of the joint development arrangement is for the two companies to jointly develop portable power solutions based on our hydrogen on demand energy systems coupled with a fuel cell 
the joint development arrangement has a three year term and each party may terminate the joint development arrangement under certain conditions 
the joint development arrangement contemplates a series of four milestones designed to culminate in a commercially available product in military or consumer electronics applications 
the milestones are focused on military and or consumer electronics applications 
upon the successful completion of each of the four milestones  dow has a right  but not an obligation  to purchase a number of shares of our series b preferred stock series b which is convertible into a number of shares of our common stock that could be purchased for  based upon a purchase price equal to the volume weighted average price for the trading day period prior to the date of issuance 
if dow purchases shares of our series b  dow will also receive warrants to purchase a number of shares of our common stock that equals of the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the series b 
if dow elects to purchase shares of our series b  we will also issue to dow additional shares of series a at market value such that dow will own a certain percentage of our capital stock as of the date of issuance as provided in the dow stock purchase agreement 
if dow elects not to purchase shares of our series b upon completion of any milestone  we will issue to dow a lesser number of additional shares of series a at market value 
on may   the first milestone under the joint development agreement was met 
dow elected to purchase  shares of series b for  and received detachable warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock with an exercise price of per share which was recorded as a discount to series b for  based on the fair value of the warrants at the date of the 
table of contents issuance 
series b was initially convertible into ten shares of our common stock 
the shares of series b bear a cumulative dividend payable in shares of common stock or cash  at our option and are junior to series a 
in accordance with the joint development arrangement and achievement of the first milestone  we also issued  shares of series a that were earned by dow through human resource and intellectual property contributions toward achievement of the first milestone 
as a result of the issuance of series a  we recorded a non cash charge of  as product development expense based on the market value of the underlying common stock as of may  effective december   we entered into an agreement with dow whereby dow waived anti dilution adjustments for a period of one year in exchange for a reduction in their exercise price of warrants from to 
gecko on february   we entered into a three year joint development program with gecko energy technologies  inc gecko to collaborate on the development and commercialization of portable fuel cell systems for use in military  medical  industrial and consumer electronics applications 
these products will pair the company s patented hydrogen on demand technology with gecko s thin planar proton exchange membrane pem fuel cells to create a hydrogen battery that is lighter  smaller and less expensive than traditional batteries for a variety of applications 
gecko s efforts are focused on the development of an easy to manufacture fuel cell that provides portable device makers with design flexibility by allowing the thin power source to be part of the exterior surface of the device itself 
in addition to the joint development program through july  we acquired approximately of the outstanding common stock of gecko in exchange for million in cash and a one year commitment to provide services and facilities valued at million based on direct expenses to be incurred by us throughout on december   the company through mce venture  llc mce  a wholly owned subsidiary of millennium cell  entered into an agreement to acquire the remaining of common stock of gecko the acquisition 
under the terms of the agreement  each selling stockholder received  shares  shares total of our common stock 
upon the acquisition  mce s name was changed to gecko energy technologies  llc gecko llc 
the former president and chief operating officer of gecko were named the president and the chief operating officer of gecko llc  pursuant to employment agreements they each entered into with gecko llc on december   in connection with the acquisition the employment agreements 
the employment agreements have the same material terms as the employment agreements had with gecko prior to the acquisition  and provide for a base salary of  per year for each officer 
in addition  the vesting of certain restricted stock awards that we had granted to the former president and chief operating officer  shares each under consulting agreements that existed prior to the acquisition were accelerated as a result of the acquisition 
following is a summary of the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the effective date of the acquisition cash plant and equipment intangibles total assets acquired less current liabilities assumed net assets acquired convertible debentures on february   we privately sold to six institutional and accredited investors  aggregate principal amount of our unsecured convertible debentures due the debentures  and warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
interest will accrue on the debentures at the prime rate currently and is payable on a quarterly basis in shares of common stock or  if the company satisfies certain conditions  it may elect to pay interest in cash 
the debentures are convertible into shares of common stock at an initial conversion price of and  under certain circumstances  at a conversion price equal to of the volume weighted average price of the common stock for the ten consecutive trading days preceding the applicable notice of conversion 
the discounted portion of these conversions would result in bcf charges in accordance with eitf application of issue no 
to certain convertible instruments and eitf accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios 

table of contents in connection with this private sale  we also entered into a registration rights agreement with the investors under which we agreed to file a registration statement to register under the securities act the resale of the shares underlying the debentures including any shares issued as payment of interest and the warrants 
if we do not file the registration statement with the sec within days of the closing or if the registration statement is not effective by the th day after the closing  we agreed to pay the investors liquidated damages for each days period in which we fail to file the registration statement or such registration statement is not effective  as applicable in an amount equal to of the aggregate purchase price for the debentures

off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  commitments and contingencies in april  we amended our main operating lease for our facility to provide for additional space for our principal operating offices and laboratories 
the amended lease will expire in and contains options to renew for an additional eight years  and will require us to pay our allocated share of taxes and operating costs in addition to the annual base rent payment 
future minimum annual lease commitments  excluding estimated allocated taxes and maintenance under the amended operating leases  are noted below 
in connection with the amended lease agreement  we issued a letter of credit to the landlord for  in lieu of a cash security deposit 
we collateralized the letter of credit with a portion of our cash and classified the letter of credit as restricted cash 
the funds used for collateral will not be available for use in operations 
between january and april  we received an aggregate of  from a recoverable grant award from the state of new jersey commission on science and technology 
the funds were used to partially fund costs directly related to development of our technology 
the recoverable grant is required to be repaid when we generate net sales in a fiscal year 
the repayment obligation  which began in june  escalates from to of net sales over a ten year period 
we are obligated to repay the unpaid amount of the original grant at the end of the ten year period 
as of december   we have repaid approximately  and an additional  was paid in the first quarter of

we received net proceeds from the sale of new jersey net operating losses nols in conjunction with the new jersey emerging technology and biotechnology financial assistance program of   and  in  and  respectively 
this program allows certain companies to apply to transfer new jersey nols to other companies 
this program  if continued by the state in future years  may provide us with similar cash inflows if we continue to incur nols 
critical accounting policies application of critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and other financial information 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
in addition  our reported financial condition and results of operations could vary due to a change in the application of a particular accounting standard 
we regard an accounting estimate underlying our financial statements as a critical accounting estimate if the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of estimation and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  would have had a material effect on the presentation of financial condition  changes in financial condition  or results of operations 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
not all of these significant accounting policies  however  require management to make difficult  complex or subjective judgments or estimates 
our management has discussed our accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and we believe that our estimates relating to revenue recognition  convertible debt and stock options described below fit the definition of critical accounting estimates 
revenue recognition our near term revenues will be derived substantially from contracts that require the company to deliver hydrogen generation or fuel cell technology  management services  system design and prototype systems and licensing of technology for test and evaluation 
revenues are recognized in the period in which the technology is delivered or licensed revenue is earned 
convertible debt we account for the issuance and conversion of convertible debt in accordance with apb no 
 accounting for convertible debt and debt issued with stock purchase warrants 
as a result  we have and will record original issue discounts to the extent the fair value of the debt is below the face value of the instrument and amortize the discount over the life of the instrument 
to the extent 
table of contents conversions of debt into common stock are made prior to the maturity date of the instrument  we will record as interest expense a ratable proportion of the discount associated with the face value of the debt converted 
we account for issuances of convertible debt in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 application of issue no 
to certain convertible instruments eitf no 
 and eitf no 
 accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios eitf no 

as a result of certain conversion price discounts included within our outstanding debt instruments  we will record interest expense resulting from bcfs as described under the caption liquidity and capital resources above 
stock based compensation we sponsor a stock based compensation plan pursuant to which non qualified stock options and restricted stock awards are granted to eligible employees 
through the year ended december   we followed the disclosure only provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas  and  accordingly  accounted for awards under these plans pursuant to the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb and related interpretations  as permitted by sfas under apb  compensation expense was recognized in the financial statements relating to awards of stock 
however  no compensation expense was recorded in the financial statements for stock option grants  as all options have been granted with an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payments  sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
sfas r revises sfas  supersedes apb and amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
 statement of cash flows 
under that transition method  compensation expense is now recognized in the financial statements on a go forward basis for a all share based payments granted prior to  but not vested as of january   based upon the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  and b share based payments granted on or subsequent to january   based upon the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
the grant date fair value of awards expected to vest is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the related awards 
under the modified prospective transition method  results for prior periods have not been restated 
the grant date fair value of stock awards is based upon the underlying price of the stock on the date of grant 
the grant date fair value of stock option awards must be determined using an option pricing model 
option pricing models require the use of estimates and assumptions as to a the expected term of the option  b the expected volatility of the price of the underlying stock  c the risk free interest rate for the expected term of the option and d pre vesting forfeiture rates 
for stock options granted  the company uses the black scholes option pricing formula for determining the grant date fair value of such awards 
the expected term of the option is based upon the contractual term and expected employee exercise and expected post vesting employment termination behavior 
the expected volatility of the price of the underlying stock is based upon the historical volatility of our stock computed over a period of time equal to the expected term of the option 
the risk free interest rate is based upon the implied yields currently available from the us treasury zero coupon yield curve for issues with a remaining duration equal to the expected term of the option 
pre vesting forfeiture rates are estimated based upon past voluntary termination behavior and past option forfeitures 
the following table sets forth the weighted average assumptions used to calculate the fair value of options granted for the years ended december expected stock price volatility risk free interest rate s expected life of options years changes in any of these assumptions could impact  potentially materially  the amount of expense recorded in future periods related to stock based awards 

table of contents as of december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of two years 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
this interpretation increases the relevancy and comparability of financial reporting by clarifying the way companies account for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin prescribes a consistent recognition threshold and measurement attribute  as well as clear criteria for subsequently recognizing  derecognizing and measuring such tax positions for financial statement purposes 
the interpretation also requires expanded disclosure with respect to the uncertainty in income taxes 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect that the adoption of fin will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas will be applied under other accounting principles that require or permit fair value measurements  as this is a relevant measurement attribute 
this statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently evaluating the impact of this statement on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure of market risk 
market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  operating results or cash flows due to changes in us interest rates 
this exposure is directly related to our normal operating activities 
our cash and cash equivalents are invested with high quality issuers and are generally of a short term nature 
as a result  we do not believe that near term changes in interest rates will have a material effect on our future results of operations 
our system s ability to produce energy depends on the availability of sodium borohydride  which has a limited commercial use and is not manufactured in vast quantities 
there are currently only two major manufacturers of sodium borohydride and there can be no assurance that the high cost of this specialty chemical will be reduced 
once we commence full operations in the future  we may need to enter into long term supply contracts to protect against price increases of sodium borohydride 
as a result  we may be subject to commodity price risk in the future and there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into agreements to protect against such risk
