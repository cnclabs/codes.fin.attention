item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year in review southwest recorded a profit of million in  an increase of million  or percent  compared to the company s net income of million 
although the airline industry as a whole in was expected to report its first collective profit since  southwest s string of consecutive profitable years has now reached  and the company also extended its number of consecutive profitable quarters to  both of which are unmatched in the industry 
southwest s operating income was million  an increase of million  or percent  compared to the increase in operating income was driven primarily by strong revenues  especially during the first half of the year  and effective cost control measures 
as a result of the extensive restructuring in the us airline industry in and  several carriers reduced domestic capacity  resulting in fare increases and higher load factors for many airlines in in fact  southwest s load factor of percent was a company record 
the company modestly raised its fares over the course of the year  resulting in an increase in passenger revenue yield per rpm passenger revenues divided by revenue passenger miles of percent compared to unit revenue total revenue divided by available seat miles also increased a healthy percent compared to levels  as a result of the higher load factor and higher rpm yield 
the company s casm cost per available seat mile was basically flat compared to  excluding fuel 
this was primarily a result of the company s continued focus on controlling non fuel costs and attempting to offset wage rate and benefit increases through productivity and efficiency improvements 
in addition  the company s headcount per aircraft at december  was  which was an improvement versus a year ago level of furthermore  from the end of to the end of  the company s headcount per aircraft decreased percent  as the number of employees remained virtually flat despite the net addition of aircraft during that three year period 
including fuel expense  casm increased percent compared to  primarily due to the percent increase in the company s fuel cost per gallon  including the effects of hedging 
significant events for southwest and or the airline industry during included the wright amendment reform act of immediately lifted through ticketing restrictions  so that customers could purchase a single one stop ticket between dallas love field and any southwest destination beyond the nine wright amendment states to which nonstop love field service is permitted  and will eventually eliminate substantially all restrictions associated with the wright amendment in this act also reduced the maximum number of available gates for commercial air service at love field from to  of which the company will ultimately lease dallas love field is a significant destination for southwest as well as the location of the company s headquarters 
the department of transportation announced that for august  september  and october  southwest carried the most passengers of any us airline 
southwest began service to two new destinations denver  colorado and washington dulles in northern virginia 
during  southwest was authorized by its board of directors to repurchase a total of billion of its outstanding common stock 
for the year ended december   the company repurchased million shares for million 
the transportation security administration tsa mandated new security measures as a result of a terrorist plot uncovered by authorities in london 
the stringent new rules  mostly regarding the types of liquid items that can be carried onboard the aircraft  had a negative impact on air travel beginning in mid august  especially on shorthaul routes and with business travelers 
the company estimated it lost more than million in passenger revenue in august and september related to the security threat and these new restrictions 
the price of jet fuel continued to be a significant factor for southwest and other airlines 
despite the company s industry leading fuel hedging program  which resulted in cash savings of million in  the company s jet fuel cost per gallon still increased by percent compared to the company added aircraft in  bringing its fleet to boeing s at december  as the company experienced in  it must continue to overcome higher jet fuel prices to grow profits 
based on current and projected energy prices for and expected growth plans  the company 
table of contents believes expenditures for jet fuel could increase between million and million compared to  even including the effects of fuel derivative contracts the company has in place as of january the company s fuel derivative contracts in place for provide protection for nearly percent of the company s expected jet fuel consumption at an average price of approximately per barrel of crude oil 
the company once again hopes to overcome the impact of higher anticipated fuel prices and other cost pressures through improved revenues and continued focus on non fuel costs 
as southwest moves into  the company believes its low cost competitive advantage  protective fuel hedging position  excellent employees  and strong balance sheet will allow southwest to respond quickly to potential industry consolidation and to favorable market opportunities 
the company plans to add new aircraft to its fleet in  resulting in a net available seat mile asm capacity increase of approximately eight percent 
based on these deliveries  the company s fleet will total s by the end of results of operations compared with the company s consolidated net income for was million 
per share  diluted  as compared to net income of million 
per share  diluted  an increase of million  or percent 
operating income for was million  an increase of million  or percent  compared to the increase in operating income was primarily due to higher revenues from the company s fleet growth  improved load factors  and higher fares  which more than offset a significant increase in the cost of jet fuel 
the company believes operating income provides a better indication of the company s financial performance for both and than does net income 
this is due to the fact that  generally  certain gains and losses  recorded in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas  that relate to fuel derivatives expiring in future periods  are included in other gains losses  which is below the operating income line  in both periods 
in  these adjustments  which are related to the ineffectiveness of hedges and the loss of hedge accounting for certain fuel derivatives and are included in other gains losses  totaled net losses of million 
for  these adjustments totaled net gains of million 
operating revenues consolidated operating revenues increased billion  or percent  primarily due to a billion  or percent  increase in passenger revenues 
the increase in passenger revenues primarily was due to an increase in capacity  an increase in rpm yield  and an increase in load factor 
approximately percent of the increase in passenger revenue was due to the company s percent increase in available seat miles compared to the company increased available seat miles as a result of the addition of aircraft all aircraft 
approximately percent of the increase in passenger revenue was due to the percent increase in passenger yields 
average passenger fares increased percent compared to  primarily due to less fare discounting because of the strong demand for air travel coupled with the availability of fewer seats as a result of industrywide domestic capacity reductions 
the remainder of the passenger revenue increase primarily was due to the point increase in the company s load factor compared to the percent load factor for represented the highest annual load factor in the company s history 
the airline revenue environment changed significantly from the first half of to the second half of the year 
the company believes this was due to both reduced demand related to domestic economic factors  as well as the effects of the increased carryon baggage restrictions put in place following the terrorist plot uncovered by london authorities in august the airline revenue environment regained some momentum during late fourth quarter  and  despite growing capacity percent during the quarter  the company achieved a record load factor of percent at healthy yields  which resulted in a steady unit revenue growth rate of percent 
based upon traffic and bookings to date  the company expects first quarter unit revenue growth to exceed first quarter s cents per asm 
consolidated freight revenues increased slightly versus an million  or percent  increase in freight and cargo revenues  primarily as a result of higher rates charged  was almost entirely offset by lower mail revenues 
the lower mail revenues were primarily due to the company s decision to discontinue carrying mail for the us postal service effective as of the end of second quarter due to this mid year decision in  the company expects a year over year decrease in freight revenue for the first half of other revenues increased million  or percent  compared to  primarily from higher commissions earned from programs the company sponsors with certain business partners  such as the company sponsored chase visa

the company has also announced it will install blended winglets on a significant number of its aircraft  beginning in first quarter 
table of contents the company has benefited from the recent decline in energy prices and is currently percent protected with fuel derivative instruments for its first quarter jet fuel purchase requirements 
these instruments are at an average crude oil equivalent price of per barrel  and the majority of these positions effectively perform like option contracts allowing the company to benefit in most cases from energy price decreases 
based on this protection and current market conditions  the company expects its first quarter jet fuel cost per gallon to be in the to range  excluding the impact of any hedge ineffectiveness and derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting as defined in sfas as of mid january  the company had fuel derivative contracts in place for approximately percent of its expected fuel consumption for the remainder of at approximately per barrel  percent in at approximately per barrel  over percent in at approximately per barrel  over percent in at per barrel  approximately percent in at per barrel  and percent in at per barrel

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap gaap 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
the company s estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and changes in the business environment 
however  actual results may differ from estimates under different conditions  sometimes materially 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most subjective judgments 
the company s most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below 
revenue recognition as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  tickets sold for passenger air travel are initially deferred as air traffic liability 
passenger revenue is recognized and air traffic liability is reduced when the service is provided ie  when the flight takes place 
air traffic liability represents tickets sold for future travel dates and estimated future refunds and exchanges of tickets sold for past travel dates 
the balance in air traffic liability fluctuates throughout the year based on seasonal travel patterns and fare sale activity 
the company s air traffic liability balance at december  was million  compared to million as of december  
table of contents estimating the amount of tickets that will be refunded  exchanged  or forfeited involves some level of subjectivity and judgment 
the majority of the company s tickets sold are nonrefundable  which is the primary source of forfeited tickets 
according to the company s contract of carriage  tickets whether refundable or nonrefundable that are sold but not flown on the travel date can be reused for another flight  up to a year from the date of sale  or can be refunded if the ticket is refundable 
a small percentage of tickets or partial tickets expire unused 
fully refundable tickets are rarely forfeited 
air traffic liability includes an estimate of the amount of future refunds and exchanges  net of forfeitures  for all unused tickets once the flight date has passed 
these estimates are based on historical experience over many years 
the company and members of the airline industry have consistently applied this accounting method to estimate revenue from forfeited tickets at the date of travel 
estimated future refunds and exchanges included in the air traffic liability account are constantly evaluated based on subsequent refund and exchange activity to validate the accuracy of the company s estimates with respect to forfeited tickets 
holding other factors constant  a ten percent change in the company s estimate of the amount of refunded  exchanged  or forfeited tickets for would have resulted in a million  or  change in passenger revenues recognized for that period 
events and circumstances outside of historical fare sale activity or historical customer travel patterns  as noted  can result in actual refunds  exchanges  or forfeited tickets differing significantly from estimates 
the company evaluates its estimates within a narrow range of acceptable amounts 
if actual refunds  exchanges  or forfeiture experience results in an amount outside of this range  estimates and assumptions are reviewed and adjustments to air traffic liability and to passenger revenue are recorded  as necessary 
additional factors that may affect estimated refunds and exchanges include  but may not be limited to  the company s refund and exchange policy  the mix of refundable and nonrefundable fares  and promotional fare activity 
the company s estimation techniques have been consistently applied from year to year  however  as with any estimates  actual refund  exchange  and forfeiture activity may vary from estimated amounts 
no material adjustments were recorded for years   or the company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for future refunds  exchanges  and forfeited tickets would be reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made 
accounting for long lived assets as of december   the company had approximately billion at cost of long lived assets  including billion at cost in flight equipment and related assets 
flight equipment primarily relates to the boeing aircraft in the company s fleet at december   which are either owned or on capital lease 
the remaining boeing aircraft in the company s fleet at december   are on operating lease 
in accounting for long lived assets  the company must make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets  the expected residual values of the assets  and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate 
the following table shows a breakdown of the company s long lived asset groups along with information about estimated useful lives and residual values of these groups estimated residual estimated useful life value aircraft and engines to years aircraft parts fleet life ground property and equipment to years leasehold improvements years or lease term in estimating the lives and expected residual values of its aircraft  the company primarily has relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types and recommendations from boeing  the manufacturer of the company s aircraft 
aircraft estimated useful lives are based on the number of cycles flown one take off and landing 
the company has made a conversion of cycles into years based on both its historical and anticipated future utilization of the aircraft 
subsequent revisions to these estimates  which can be significant  could be caused by changes to the company s maintenance program  changes in utilization of the aircraft actual cycles during a given period of time  governmental regulations on aging aircraft  and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types 
the company evaluates its estimates and assumptions each reporting period and  when warranted  adjusts these estimates and assumptions 
generally  these adjustments are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation and amortization expense  as required by gaap 

table of contents when appropriate  the company evaluates its long lived assets for impairment 
factors that would indicate potential impairment may include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of the long lived asset s  a significant change in the long lived asset s physical condition  and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the long lived asset 
while the airline industry as a whole has experienced many of these indicators  southwest has continued to operate all of its aircraft  generate positive cash flow  and produce profits 
consequently  the company has not identified any impairments related to its existing aircraft fleet 
the company will continue to monitor its long lived assets and the airline operating environment 
the company believes it unlikely that materially different estimates for expected lives  expected residual values  and impairment evaluations would be made or reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made 
financial derivative instruments the company utilizes financial derivative instruments primarily to manage its risk associated with changing jet fuel prices  and accounts for them under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas 
see qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk for more information on these risk management activities and see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on sfas  the company s fuel hedging program  and financial derivative instruments 
sfas requires that all derivatives be marked to market fair value and recorded on the consolidated balance sheet 
at december   the company was a party to over financial derivative instruments  related to its fuel hedging program  for year and beyond 
the fair value of the company s fuel hedging financial derivative instruments recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheet as of december   was million  compared to billion at december  the large decrease in fair value primarily was due to the decrease in energy prices in the second half of  as well as the expiration of approximately million in fuel derivative instruments that related to  net of new derivative instruments the company added for future years 
changes in the fair values of these instruments can vary dramatically  as was evident during both and  based on changes in the underlying commodity prices 
market price changes can be driven by factors such as supply and demand  inventory levels  weather events  refinery capacity  political agendas  and general economic conditions  among other items 
the financial derivative instruments utilized by the company primarily are a combination of collars  purchased call options  and fixed price swap agreements 
the company does not purchase or hold any derivative instruments for trading purposes 
the company enters into financial derivative instruments with third party institutions in over the counter markets 
since the majority of the company s financial derivative instruments are not traded on a market exchange  the company estimates their fair values 
depending on the type of instrument  the values are determined by the use of present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets 
also  since there is not a reliable forward market for jet fuel  the company must estimate the future prices of jet fuel in order to measure the effectiveness of the hedging instruments in offsetting changes to those prices  as required by sfas forward jet fuel prices are estimated through the observation of similar commodity futures prices such as crude oil  heating oil  and unleaded gasoline and adjusted based on historical variations to those like commodities 
fair values for financial derivative instruments and forward jet fuel prices are both estimated prior to the time that the financial derivative instruments settle  and the time that jet fuel is purchased and consumed  respectively 
however  once settlement of the financial derivative instruments occurs and the hedged jet fuel is purchased and consumed  all values and prices are known and are recognized in the financial statements 
in recent years  because of increased volatility in energy markets  the company s estimates have materially differed from actual results  resulting in increased volatility in the company s periodic financial results 
estimating the fair value of these fuel derivative instruments and forward prices for jet fuel will also result in changes in their values from period to period and thus determine how they are accounted for under sfas to the extent that the change in the estimated fair value of a fuel derivative instrument differs from the change in the estimated price of the associated jet fuel to be purchased  both on a cumulative and a period to period basis  ineffectiveness of the fuel hedge can result  as defined by sfas this could result in the immediate recording of noncash charges or income  representing the change in the fair value of the derivative  even though the derivative instrument may not expire until a future period 

table of contents likewise  if a derivative contract ceases to qualify for hedge accounting  the changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument is recorded every period to other gains and losses in the income statement in the period of the change 
ineffectiveness is inherent in hedging jet fuel with derivative positions based in other crude oil related commodities  especially given the magnitude of the current fair market value of the company s fuel derivatives and the recent volatility in the prices of refined products 
due to the volatility in markets for crude oil and related products  the company is unable to predict the amount of ineffectiveness each period  including the loss of hedge accounting  which could be determined on a derivative by derivative basis or in the aggregate 
this may result  and has resulted  in increased volatility in the company s financial statements 
the significant increase in the amount of hedge ineffectiveness and unrealized gains and losses on the change in value of derivative contracts settling in future periods recorded during recent periods has been due to a number of factors 
these factors include the significant fluctuation in energy prices  the number of derivative positions the company holds  significant weather events that have affected refinery capacity and the production of refined products  and the volatility of the different types of products the company uses for protection 
the number of instances in which the company has discontinued hedge accounting for specific hedges and for specific refined products  such as unleaded gasoline  has increased recently  primarily due to these reasons 
in these cases  the company has determined that the hedges will not regain effectiveness in the time period remaining until settlement and therefore must discontinue special hedge accounting  as defined by sfas when this happens  any changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are marked to market through earnings in the period of change 
as the fair value of the company s hedge positions increases in amount  there is a higher degree of probability that there will be continued variability recorded in the income statement and that the amount of hedge ineffectiveness and unrealized gains or losses recorded in future periods will be material 
this is primarily due to the fact that small differences in the correlation of crude oil related products are leveraged over large dollar volumes 
sfas is a complex accounting standard with stringent requirements  including the documentation of a company hedging strategy  statistical analysis to qualify a commodity for hedge accounting both on a historical and a prospective basis  and strict contemporaneous documentation that is required at the time each hedge is designated by the company 
as required by sfas  the company assesses the effectiveness of each of its individual hedges on a quarterly basis 
the company also examines the effectiveness of its entire hedging program on a quarterly basis utilizing statistical analysis 
this analysis involves utilizing regression and other statistical analyses that compare changes in the price of jet fuel to changes in the prices of the commodities used for hedging purposes 
the company continually looks for better and more accurate methodologies in forecasting future cash flows relating to its jet fuel hedging program 
these estimates are used in the measurement of effectiveness for the company s fuel hedges  as required by sfas during first quarter  the company did revise its method for forecasting future cash flows 
previously  the company had estimated future cash flows using actual market forward prices of like commodities and adjusting for historical differences from the company s actual jet fuel purchase prices 
the company s new methodology utilizes a statistical based regression equation with data from market forward prices of like commodities 
this equation is then adjusted for certain items  such as transportation costs  that are stated in the company s fuel purchasing contracts with its vendors 
this change to the company s methodology for estimating future cash flows ie  jet fuel prices was applied prospectively  in accordance with the company s interpretation of sfas the company believes that this change for estimating future cash flows will result in more effective hedges over the long term 
the company also utilizes financial derivative instruments in the form of interest rate swap agreements 
the primary objective for the company s use of interest rate hedges is to reduce the volatility of net interest income by better matching the repricing of its assets and liabilities 
during  the company entered into interest rate swap agreements relating to its million senior unsecured notes due  and million class a pass through certificates due the interest rate swap associated with the million class a pass through certificates expired on the date the certificates were repaid in fourth quarter the floating rate paid under the swap associated with the million senior unsecured notes due sets in arrears 
the company pays the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin every six months and receives every six months on a notional amount of million until the average floating rate paid under this agreement during is estimated to be percent based on actual and forward rates at december  
table of contents the company is also party to an interest rate swap agreement relating to its million senior unsecured notes due  in which the floating rate is set at the beginning of each six month period 
under this agreement  the company pays libor plus a margin every six months and receives every six months on a notional amount of million until the average floating rate paid under this agreement during was percent 
the company s interest rate swap agreements qualify as fair value hedges  as defined by sfas in addition  these interest rate swap agreements qualify for the shortcut method of accounting for hedges  as defined by sfas under the shortcut method  the hedges are assumed to be perfectly effective  and  thus  there is no ineffectiveness to be recorded in earnings 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements  which are adjusted regularly  are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet  as necessary  with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of the long term debt 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements  excluding accrued interest  at december   was a liability of approximately million 
the comparable fair value of these same agreements at december   was a liability of million 
the long term portion of these amounts are recorded in other deferred liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet for each respective year 
in accordance with fair value hedging  the offsetting entry is an adjustment to decrease the carrying value of long term debt 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the fair value of financial derivative instruments  and forward jet fuel prices  would be made or reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made 
share based compensation the company has share based compensation plans covering the majority of its employee groups  including plans adopted via collective bargaining  a plan covering the company s board of directors  and plans related to employment contracts with one executive officer of the company 
prior to january   the company accounted for stock based compensation utilizing the intrinsic value method in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations 
accordingly  no compensation expense was recognized for fixed option plans because the exercise prices of employee stock options equaled or exceeded the market prices of the underlying stock on the dates of grant 
however  prior to adoption of sfas r  share based compensation had been included in pro forma disclosures in the financial statement footnotes for periods prior to effective january   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment using the modified retrospective transition method 
among other items  sfas r eliminates the use of apb and the intrinsic value method of accounting  and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  based on the grant date fair value of those awards  in the financial statements 
under the modified retrospective method  compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date  based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after that date  and based on the requirements of sfas for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas r 
in addition  results for prior periods have been retroactively adjusted utilizing the pro forma disclosures in those prior financial statements  except as noted 
as part of this revision  the company recorded cumulative share based compensation expense of million for the period  resulting in a reduction to retained earnings in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  this adjustment  along with the creation of a net deferred income tax asset in the amount of million  resulted in an offsetting increase to capital in excess of par value in the amount of million in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  the deferred tax asset represents the portion of the cumulative expense related to stock options that will result in a future tax deduction 
the company estimates the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant utilizing a modified black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short term traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
however  certain assumptions used in the black scholes model  such as expected term  can be adjusted to incorporate the unique characteristics of the company s stock option awards 
option valuation models require the input of somewhat subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility and expected term 
for and  the company has relied on observations of both historical volatility trends  implied future volatility 
table of contents observations as determined by independent third parties  and implied volatility from traded options on the company s stock 
for both and stock option grants  the company utilized expected volatility based on the expected life of the option  but within a range of to 
prior to  the company relied exclusively on historical volatility as an input for determining the estimated fair value of stock options 
in determining the expected term of the option grants  the company has observed the actual terms of prior grants with similar characteristics  the actual vesting schedule of the grant  and assessed the expected risk tolerance of different optionee groups 
other assumptions required for estimating fair value with the black scholes model are the expected risk free interest rate and expected dividend yield of the company s stock 
the risk free interest rates used were actual us treasury zero coupon rates for bonds matching the expected term of the option on the date of grant 
the expected dividend yield of the company s common stock over the expected term of the option on the date of grant was estimated based on the company s current dividend yield  and adjusted for anticipated future changes 
vesting terms for the company s stock option plans differ based on the type of grant made and the group to which the options are granted 
for grants made to employees under collective bargaining plans  vesting has ranged in length from immediate vesting to vesting periods in accordance with the period covered by the respective collective bargaining agreement 
for other employee plans  options vest and become fully exercisable over three  five  or ten years of continued employment  depending upon the grant type 
for grants in any of the company s plans that are subject to graded vesting over a service period  the company recognizes expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
none of the company s grants include performance based or market based vesting conditions  as defined 
as of december   the company has million in remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to past grants of stock options  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
the total recognition period for the remaining unrecognized compensation cost is approximately ten years  however  the majority of this cost will be recognized over the next two years  in accordance with vesting provisions 
over percent of net unrecognized amount at december   related to options granted prior to the adoption of sfas r on january  in addition  the vast majority of the million in share based compensation expense reflected in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december   was related to options granted prior to the adoption of sfas r 
based on employee stock options expected to vest during  the number of options eligible to be granted in future periods and the company s expectation of future grants  the company expects the expense related to share based compensation to decrease significantly during compared to expense 
the company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of stock options granted would be made based on the conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made 
forward looking statements some statements in this form k or otherwise made by the company or on the company s behalf from time to time in other reports  filings with the securities and exchange commission  news releases  conferences  world wide web postings or otherwise which are not historical facts  may be forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  section e of the securities exchange act of  and the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements are based on  and include statements about  southwest s estimates  expectations  beliefs  intentions or strategies for the future  and the assumptions underlying these forward looking statements 
specific forward looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and include  without limitation  words such as anticipates  believes  estimates  expects  intends  forecasts  may  will  should  and similar expressions 
forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual results may differ materially from what is expressed in or indicated by southwest s forward looking statements or from historical experience or the company s present expectations 
factors that could cause these differences include  but are not limited to  those set forth under item a risk factors 
caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on the company s forward looking statements  which represent the company s views only as of the date this report is filed 
the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward looking statement

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk southwest has interest rate risk in its floating rate debt obligations and interest rate swaps  and has commodity price risk in jet fuel required to operate its aircraft fleet 
the company purchases jet fuel at prevailing market prices  but seeks to manage market risk through execution of a documented hedging strategy 
southwest has market sensitive instruments in the form of fixed rate debt instruments and financial derivative instruments used to hedge its exposure to jet fuel price increases 
the company also operates aircraft under operating and capital leases 
however  leases are not considered market sensitive financial instruments and  therefore  are not included in the interest rate sensitivity analysis below 
commitments related to leases are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company does not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information on the company s accounting for its hedging program and for further details on the company s financial derivative instruments 
fuel hedging the company utilizes financial derivative instruments  on both a short term and a long term basis  as a form of insurance against significant increases in fuel prices 
the company believes there is significant risk in not hedging against the possibility of such fuel price increases 
the company expects to consume approximately billion gallons of jet fuel in based on this usage  a change in jet fuel prices of just one cent per gallon would impact the company s fuel and oil expense by approximately million per year  excluding any impact of the company s derivative instruments 
the fair values of outstanding financial derivative instruments related to the company s jet fuel market price risk at december   were net assets of million 
the current portion of these financial derivative instruments  or million  is classified as fuel derivative contracts in the consolidated balance sheet 
the long term portion of these financial derivative instruments  or million  is included in other assets 
the fair values of the derivative instruments  depending on the type of instrument  were determined by use of present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets 
an immediate ten percent increase or decrease in underlying fuel related commodity prices from the december   prices would correspondingly change the fair value of the commodity derivative instruments in place by up to million 
changes in the related commodity derivative instrument cash flows may change by more or less than this amount based upon further fluctuations in futures prices as well as related income tax effects 
this sensitivity analysis uses industry standard valuation models and holds all inputs constant at december   levels  except underlying futures prices 
outstanding financial derivative instruments expose the company to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements 
however  the company does not expect any of the counterparties to fail to meet their obligations 
the credit exposure related to these financial instruments is represented by the fair value of contracts with a positive fair value at the reporting date 
to manage credit risk  the company selects and will periodically review counterparties based on credit ratings  limits its exposure to a single counterparty  and monitors the market position of the program and its relative market position with each counterparty 
at december   the company had agreements with eight counterparties containing early termination rights and or bilateral collateral provisions whereby security is required if market risk exposure exceeds a specified threshold amount or credit ratings fall below certain levels 
at december   the company held million in cash collateral deposits under these bilateral collateral provisions 
these collateral deposits serve to decrease  but not totally eliminate  the credit risk associated with the company s hedging program 
the deposits are included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
see also note to the consolidated financial statements 
financial market risk the vast majority of the company s assets are aircraft  which are long lived 
the company s strategy is to maintain a conservative balance sheet and grow capacity steadily and profitably 
while the company uses financial leverage  it has maintained a strong balance sheet and an a credit rating on its senior unsecured fixed rate debt with standard poor s and fitch ratings agencies  and a baa credit rating with moody s rating agency 
the company s and french credit agreements do not give rise to significant fair value risk but do give rise to interest rate risk because these borrowings are floating rate debt 
in addition  as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has 
table of contents converted certain of its long term debt to floating rate debt by entering into interest rate swap agreements 
this includes the company s million senior unsecured notes due and the million senior unsecured notes due although there is interest rate risk associated with these floating rate borrowings  the risk for the and french credit agreements is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the company may prepay this debt under certain conditions 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the material terms of the company s short term and long term debt 
excluding the million senior unsecured notes  and the million senior unsecured notes that were converted to a floating rate as previously noted  the company had outstanding senior unsecured notes totaling million at december  these senior unsecured notes currently have a weighted average maturity of years at fixed rates averaging percent at december   which is comparable to average rates prevailing for similar debt instruments over the last ten years 
the carrying value of the company s floating rate debt totaled million  and this debt had a weighted average maturity of years at floating rates averaging percent for the twelve months ended december  in total  the company s fixed rate debt and floating rate debt represented percent and percent  respectively  of total noncurrent assets at december  the company also has some risk associated with changing interest rates due to the short term nature of its invested cash  which totaled billion  and short term investments  which totaled million  at december  the company invests available cash in certificates of deposit  highly rated money market instruments  investment grade commercial paper  auction rate securities  and other highly rated financial instruments 
because of the short term nature of these investments  the returns earned parallel closely with short term floating interest rates 
the company has not undertaken any additional actions to cover interest rate market risk and is not a party to any other material market interest rate risk management activities 
a hypothetical ten percent change in market interest rates as of december   would not have a material affect on the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt instruments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the fair value of the company s financial instruments 
a change in market interest rates could  however  have a corresponding effect on the company s earnings and cash flows associated with its floating rate debt  invested cash  and short term investments because of the floating rate nature of these items 
assuming floating market rates in effect as of december   were held constant throughout a month period  a hypothetical ten percent change in those rates would correspondingly change the company s net earnings and cash flows associated with these items by less than million 
utilizing these assumptions and considering the company s cash balance  short term investments  and floating rate debt outstanding at december   an increase in rates would have a net positive effect on the company s earnings and cash flows  while a decrease in rates would have a net negative effect on the company s earnings and cash flows 
however  a ten percent change in market rates would not impact the company s earnings or cash flow associated with the company s publicly traded fixed rate debt 
the company is also subject to various financial covenants included in its credit card transaction processing agreement  the revolving credit facility  and outstanding debt agreements 
covenants include the maintenance of minimum credit ratings 
for the revolving credit facility  the company shall also maintain  at all times  a coverage ratio  as defined in the agreement  of not less than to the company met or exceeded the minimum standards set forth in these agreements as of december  however  if conditions change and the company fails to meet the minimum standards set forth in the agreements  it could reduce the availability of cash under the agreements or increase the costs to keep these agreements intact as written
