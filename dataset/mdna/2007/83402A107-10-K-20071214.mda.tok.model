item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and related notes  which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth in more detail in item a of this annual report on form k 
we undertake no obligation to update any information in our forward looking statements 
fiscal year our fiscal year is from october to september unless otherwise stated  references to the years  and relate to the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
references to future years also relate to our fiscal year ending september 
table of contents introduction and overview our financial results in were much improved from and reflected the full year impact of the his acquisition which occurred in august our revenues increased from  gross margins improved  and  while our operating expenses increased  they declined as a percentage of revenue reflecting our focus on expense management 
we recorded operating income of million in  a substantial improvement from the million operating loss in which included a charge of million for in process research and development related to the acquired his business 
in  we restructured our manufacturing business to help us achieve our goals for growth and profitability by reallocating resources to our sap related business while optimizing our base fourthshift business 
we signed several key contracts for fourthshift edition sales to the large enterprise subsidiary market  including three leading global food and beverage manufacturers 
on the hospitality side  we completed the integration of the acquired his business  we were selected by several key multi property customers for large installations of our property management and central reservations systems  and released new versions of several products 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we are required to make estimates and judgments in preparing the financial statements that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
if our assumptions prove inaccurate or if our future results are not consistent with our historical experience  we may be required to make adjustments that could have a significant impact on our reported financial results 
we believe there are several accounting policies that are critical to an understanding of our historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses and significant estimates and judgments applied by management 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements  areas that are particularly significant include revenue recognition  the valuation of deferred tax assets  the valuation of accounts receivable  the valuation of goodwill  intangibles and in process research and development ipr d  restructuring charges  and stock based compensation 
the following discussion of our most critical policies is intended to supplement the more detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies and disclosures presented in note to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we generate our revenue from licenses of our software products  from maintenance or support for that software  from providing services related to that software and  in some instances  from related hardware 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions  securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition  and sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 

table of contents software license revenue is recognized under sop when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the fee is fixed or determinable and iv collectibility is probable and the arrangement does not require services that are essential to the functionality of the software 
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
we determine that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists with respect to a customer under i a license agreement that is signed by both the customer and by us  or ii a purchase order  quote or binding letter of intent received from and signed by the customer  in which case the customer has previously executed a license agreement with us 
we do not offer product return rights to end users or resellers 
delivery has occurred 
our software may be either physically or electronically delivered to the customer 
we determine that delivery has occurred upon shipment of the software pursuant to the billing terms of the arrangement or when the software is made available to the customer through electronic delivery 
customer acceptance generally occurs at delivery 
the fee is fixed or determinable 
if  at the outset of the customer arrangement  we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is typically recognized when the arrangement fee becomes due and payable 
collectibility is probable 
we determine whether collectibility is probable on a case by case basis 
we generate a high percentage of our license revenue from our current customer base  for which there is a history of successful collection 
we assess the probability of collection from new customers based upon the number of years the customer has been in business and a credit review process  which evaluates the customer s financial position and ultimately their ability to pay 
if we are unable to determine from the outset of an arrangement that collectibility is probable based upon our review process  revenue is recognized as payments are received 
with regard to software arrangements involving multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative fair value of each element 
our determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
our assessment of vsoe for each element is based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
we have analyzed all of the elements included in our multiple element arrangements and have determined that we have sufficient vsoe to allocate revenue to the consulting services and maintenance components of our license arrangements 
generally  we sell our consulting services separately and have established vsoe on this basis 
vsoe for maintenance is determined based upon the customer s annual renewal rates for these elements 
accordingly  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  revenue from perpetual licenses is recognized upon delivery using the residual method in accordance with sop  and revenue from maintenance is recognized ratably over the respective term  which is typically one year 
services revenue consists of fees from consulting services  maintenance and subscription distribution service provider services 
consulting services include needs assessment  software integration  security analysis  application development and training 
we bill consulting services fees either on a time and materials basis or on a fixed price schedule 
in most cases  our consulting services are not essential to the functionality of our software 
in general  our software products are fully functional upon delivery and do not require any significant modification or alteration for customer use 
customers purchase our consulting services to facilitate the adoption of our technology and may dedicate personnel to participate in the services being performed  but they may also decide to use their own resources or appoint other professional service personnel or organizations to provide these consulting services 
software products are billed separately from consulting  maintenance and subscription services 
we generally recognize revenue from consulting services as services are performed 
our customers typically purchase maintenance annually and receive unspecified product upgrades  web based technical support and telephone hot line support 
our customers typically pay for maintenance services in advance  and we defer the revenue that results and recognize it ratably over the maintenance period  which is typically one year 
where the services we provide are essential to the functionality of the software or another element of a contract  such as where we conduct custom software development as part of a software license sale  we 
table of contents recognize all related revenue based on the percentage of completion method 
this is normally measured based on the number of total hours of services performed compared to an estimate of the total hours to be incurred 
significant judgments and estimates related to the use of percentage of completion accounting include whether the services being provided are essential to the functionality of the software or another element of a contract and whether we have the ability to estimate the total service hours to be performed 
customer advances and billed amounts due from customers in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines  as discussed above  in determining our revenues  however  certain judgments and estimates are made and used to determine revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue recognized for any period  if different conditions were to prevail 
for example  in determining whether collection is probable  we assess our customers ability and intent to pay 
our actual experience with respect to collections could differ from our initial assessment if  for instance  unforeseen declines in the overall economy occur and negatively impact our customers financial condition 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
our worldwide net deferred tax assets consist of net operating loss carry forwards  tax credit carry forwards and temporary differences between taxable income loss on our tax returns and income loss before income taxes under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
a deferred tax asset generally represents future tax benefits to be received when these carry forwards can be applied against future taxable income or when expenses previously reported in our financial statements become deductible for income tax purposes 
we have  however  recorded a valuation allowance against the full amount of our net deferred tax assets 
our decision to record this valuation allowance was based on our cumulative losses incurred 
we will continue to assess the realizability of our net deferred tax assets and the need for this valuation allowance based on statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we expect to continue to provide a full valuation allowance until  or unless  we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to utilize these assets 
at that time  the valuation allowance will be reassessed and could be reduced in part or in total 
a significant portion of our valuation allowance relates to tax benefits obtained in previous business combinations 
any subsequent recognition by us of a pre acquisition tax benefit will be recorded as a reduction to goodwill as opposed to an income tax benefit in our consolidated statement of operations 
our valuation allowance was million and million at september  and  respectively 
valuation of accounts receivable 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts  which covers receivables that might not be collectible  at an amount we estimate is sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses resulting from extending credit to our customers 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we consider the need for specific customer reserves and then compute a general reserve based on the aging of our receivables 
the identification of specific customer reserves and the determination of the appropriate percentage to apply to our receivables involve a number of factors  including our historical bad debt experience and the general economic environment 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing these factors 
if the factors used in determining the allowance do not reflect future performance  then a change in the allowance for doubtful accounts would be necessary at the time of determination 
such a change may have a significant impact on our future results of operations 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at september  and  respectively 
valuation of goodwill  intangibles and ipr d 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the tangible assets acquired 
most of the companies we have acquired have not had significant tangible assets 
as a result  a significant portion of the purchase price paid in acquisitions has been allocated to goodwill  identifiable intangible assets and or recognized as an in process research and development ipr d charge as required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
ipr d is defined as the value assigned to those projects for which the related products have no alternative future use 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to ipr d and other intangible assets requires us to make significant assumptions and estimates  including estimating the future cash flows of each project or technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 

table of contents the discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods 
the assumptions and estimates we use  including the expected useful lives of the assets  affect the amount of intangible asset amortization 
identifiable intangible assets are amortized to expense over their expected useful lives and goodwill is not amortized 
once established  these assets are subject to periodic impairment assessments to determine if their current carrying values are recoverable based on information available at the time these assessments are made 
if we were to determine that the carrying value of intangibles and goodwill might not be recoverable  we would reduce the carrying value to its fair value 
any such reduction could significantly impact our results of operations 
significant assumptions and estimates are also required in making these assessments and actual results may differ from assumed and estimated amounts 
goodwill was million and million at september  and  respectively 
intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  were million and million at september  and  respectively 
restructuring charges 
when we close or restructure a substantial part of our operations we accrue the fair value of the one time termination benefits we expect to incur in reducing employee headcount in the period in which the plan is communicated and the other criteria of generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  including sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  are met 
costs related to excess leased office space from which we are no longer deriving economic benefit are recognized at fair value at the time we cease using the leased space  net of any assumed sublease income 
other contract termination costs are recognized at fair value when we actually terminate the contract in accordance with its terms 
other costs associated with exit activities are accrued as of the date the liability is incurred 
we estimate the amounts of these costs based on our expectations at the time the charges are taken and we reevaluate the remaining accruals at each reporting date based on current facts and circumstances 
if our estimates or expectations change because we are subjected to contractual obligations or negotiations we did not anticipate  we choose to further restructure our operations  or there are other costs we did not foresee  we adjust the restructuring accruals in the period that our estimates change 
such changes are recorded as increases or decreases to the restructuring related charges in our consolidated statements of operations 
stock based compensation 
in  we adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation using the modified prospective method of transition as outlined in sfas no 
r  share based payment 
the estimated fair value of stock based compensation  including stock options and other awards granted under our stock incentive plan  is recognized as compensation expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
the black scholes option pricing model is used to estimate the fair value of the stock based compensation as of the grant date 
the black scholes model  by its design  is highly complex and dependent upon key data inputs estimated by management 
the data inputs that require the greatest degree of subjective judgment are the estimated lives of the stock based awards and the estimated volatility of our stock price  and the model is highly sensitive to changes in these two data inputs 
the expected life is the estimated average length of time over which the awards will be exercised 
we have calculated a year estimated life of awards granted using our historical exercise and termination data and other analysis 
we based our estimate of expected volatility on both the daily historical trading data of our common stock and observable market prices of similar equity instruments 
we selected the historical method because we have not identified a more reliable or appropriate method to predict future volatility 
as required by sfas no 
r  our management will continue to assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate the estimated fair value of stock based compensation 
circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time which could result in changes to these assumptions 
such changes could materially impact our fair value estimates 
total stock based compensation was million and million for the years ended september  and  respectively 

table of contents results of operations revenues 
the following tables summarize revenue by reportable segment and revenue type for  and in thousands manufacturing hospitality total manufacturing hospitality total manufacturing hospitality total software licenses maintenance professional services third party software and hardware change from to change from to manufacturing hospitality total manufacturing hospitality total software licenses maintenance professional services third party software and hardware total the following tables summarize revenue by geography for  and in thousands manufacturing hospitality total manufacturing hospitality total manufacturing hospitality total americas europe  middle east africa emea asia pacific apac change from to change from to manufacturing hospitality total manufacturing hospitality total americas europe  middle east africa emea asia pacific apac total manufacturing segment in  we experienced an overall decline in manufacturing revenues of from increased maintenance revenues were not enough to offset the declines in other revenue types 
in  we experienced an overall increase of from lower license revenues were offset by increased maintenance and professional services revenues 
license revenue 
software license revenue represents fees paid by our customers for the right to use our software under perpetual licenses 
our license revenue from manufacturing software decreased in from increased sales of our fourthshift edition products in our sap business were not enough to offset declining sales of our fourthshift product in our base business 
although we will continue to service our large base of existing customers on fourthshift and other manufacturing solutions  we are focusing on our 
table of contents sap centric product  fourthshift edition for sap business one  for new customers 
this change in sales model is a lengthy process and we are continuing to develop the infrastructure necessary to support future growth in our manufacturing software business 
our license revenue from manufacturing software decreased in from this decrease was due to declining sales of our fourthshift product in the united states and in the united kingdom 
most of our sales of fourthshift are to our existing customer base and not to new customers and we experienced a decline in sales to our existing customer base 
this decline was offset by increases in sales of our fourthshift product in china to our existing customer base as well as to new customers and in license revenue relating to our infra acquisition which occurred in october maintenance revenue 
we receive maintenance revenue from our customers for the right to receive both web based and phone based customer support  the right to access web based training tools and for the right to receive periodic unspecified software upgrades from us on a when and if available basis 
maintenance revenue also includes revenue generated from other services provided by our customer service organization such as our remote management service 
our customers generally enter into annual contracts with us to receive such support  although we periodically offer multi year support programs 
our maintenance revenue for manufacturing products increased in from  and in from these increases resulted from lower attrition rates  sales of additional service offerings  the infra acquisition and price increases 
this revenue stream continues to be strong for our business and provides a high degree of visibility and predictability in the near term 
professional services revenue 
professional services revenue includes fees for training  consulting  installation and project management 
nearly all of our professional services are provided to customers of our software products 
our professional services revenue decreased in from this decrease was due to declining services in our base business  which have not yet been offset by our new efforts in the sap business 
our professional services revenue increased in from this increase was primarily due to increased business process management services  particularly in the americas 
typically there is a correlation between professional services revenue and software licenses 
although there are fluctuations in the timing and range of follow on services  we have historically experienced significant professional services revenue in the three to nine month period following delivery of our software products 
this revenue stream also provides a high degree of predictability in the near term  as the majority of our service revenue comes from contracts in place at the time we begin a given quarter 
third party software and hardware revenue 
third party software and hardware revenue primarily represents the resale of third party software licenses often software applications that are complementary to our products and hardware 
these complementary applications have been integrated to function with our software and extend the functionality of our software offerings  while third party hardware allows us to offer our customers a turnkey solution 
sales of third party software and hardware are often made simultaneously with the licensing of our own software 
third party software and hardware revenue decreased in from and in from since the sales of third party hardware and software are generally done as a courtesy to provide full solutions to our customers  it is a more volatile stream of revenue  and will fluctuate based on mix and customer demand 
revenue by geography 
in  all regions experienced slight declines in overall manufacturing revenue 
in  our overall manufacturing revenue increase in the emea and apac regions was substantially offset by the decline in the americas region 
we generated organic license and maintenance growth and increased revenue from evolution license sales in the emea region and from the infra acquisition 
our license and maintenance revenue from the apac region increased as the strength of the chinese economy continued and our customers demand for our products and services increased 
the americas region saw increased maintenance and support revenue  but this growth was more than offset by lower license revenue 
hospitality segment in  we experienced an overall increase of in our hospitality revenue from this increase was due primarily to the inclusion of a full year of revenue from the acquired his business august  slightly offset by decreased revenues from our legacy products 
in  we experienced an overall 
table of contents decrease of in hospitality revenue from in  attrition from legacy products and related support was not offset by revenue from new products and support  or the approximate million in revenue acquired from his in license revenue 
our license revenue from hospitality software increased in from this increase was due primarily to the inclusion of a full year of revenue from the acquired his business august 
our hospitality license revenue decreased in from this decrease was due to the recognition of million of license revenue from a large portfolio project in that was not repeated in  the lack of a suitable product to migrate our legacy customers from lanmark and igs  and the de emphasis of our rio product in in  we completed new releases of our medallion and portfolio products and did not meet our overall expectations for as their sales declined as well 
our decline in revenue was offset by the acquisition of his  which contributed approximately million of license revenue in maintenance revenue 
hospitality maintenance revenue increased in from  due primarily to the positive effects of the acquired his business august 
hospitality maintenance revenue decreased in from the majority of this decrease in revenue is from older products  such as lanmark and igs hotel  that are no longer sold  and we expect maintenance revenue from these products to decrease over time  offset somewhat by increased maintenance revenue from our new products 
the acquisition of his contributed approximately million of maintenance revenue in professional services 
our hospitality professional services revenue increased in from this increase was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of revenue from the acquired his business august 
our hospitality professional services revenue increased in from this was  again  primarily due to the acquisition of his  which contributed approximately million of services revenue in third party software and hardware revenue 
third party software and hardware revenue increased in from  and decreased in from as we integrate our partner solutions more closely with our primary products  we hope to see sales of these solutions grow over time 
since the sale of third party hardware is generally done as a courtesy to provide full solutions to our customers  it is a more volatile stream of revenue  and will fluctuate based on mix and customer demand 
revenue by geography 
in  all regions experienced growth in hospitality revenues 
this growth was most significant in the americas and apac regions  driven by the positive impact of the acquired his business 
in  hospitality revenue in the americas region increased 
this was more than offset by the decrease in hospitality revenue in the emea region 
this was in part due to the larger impact of his on the americas region revenues as compared to emea 
outlook 
in  we expect total revenues to be in the range of to million 
we expect that our hospitality business will continue to see growth in software license and professional services revenues 
gross margin 
the following tables summarize gross margin percentages by reportable segment and revenue type for  and manufacturing hospitality total manufacturing hospitality total manufacturing hospitality total software licenses maintenance professional services third party software and hardware total 
table of contents manufacturing segment our manufacturing software license margin improved to in from in and from in  due primarily to a reduction in costs 
our cost of license revenue includes amortization of acquired software  and costs for third party software that is embedded into some of our products 
a key factor in the improved gross margin in and was the reduction in amortization expense as we completed amortization of some of our older software intangibles 
this reduction was partially offset by increased royalty expenses  such as royalties due to sap for our fourthshift edition product 
we expect reduced license gross margin percentage going forward as fourthshift edition for sap business one increases as a percentage of total manufacturing license revenue and  depending on mix  as sales transition to our reseller channel 
we sell fourthshift edition for sap business one subject to royalties to sap business one for the proprietary code that is incorporated into the product and through direct and reseller channels 
the royalties  which vary as a percentage of sales prices based on discounts and volume  generally reduce margins on this product below typical margins on fourthshift sales 
gross margin on license revenue is higher on direct sales and indirect sales of fourthshift edition where we are primarily responsible for providing the software consulting and implementation to the end user 
in these situations the end user price is recorded as revenue 
revenue from sales through implementation partners are recorded net of the reseller s share of the transaction and therefore the revenue and related margins recognized are lower 
manufacturing maintenance gross margin was up slightly in from and comparable in and as our manufacturing support center in bangalore  india continued to help manage maintenance costs 
in addition  our additional service offerings have contributed to the increased maintenance gross margin in professional services margin increased to in from in  while it decreased to in from in as management changes in our manufacturing professional services organization and low utilization rates resulted in lower margins compared to our third party service revenue  which is associated with hardware and software sold as a courtesy to our customers  and related gross margins continue to be highly variable based on the pricing and the third party products chosen by customers 
hospitality segment our total hospitality gross margin increased to in and in from in these improvements were primarily due to the acquisition of his  cost reductions and a small increase in maintenance margins resulting from a larger portion of maintenance volumes being serviced by our facility in bangalore  india 
hospitality license gross margin increased to in  from in  and from in these increases were due primarily to the acquisition of his and cost reductions  including a reduction in amortization expense as some older software products became fully amortized in hospitality maintenance gross margin increased to in from in and from in these increases were due to the acquisition of his  cost reductions and a small increase in margins resulting from a larger portion of maintenance volumes being serviced by our facility in bangalore  india 
hospitality professional service margins were in  down from in and in  as low utilization rates resulted in lower margins 
in particular  we had several large planned rollouts where the initial services start date was repeatedly deferred due to circumstances beyond our control 
we elected to maintain our staffing levels because certain of our services personnel have government clearance which is difficult to obtain 
these large services engagements have now started 
third party gross margins can be highly variable based on the pricing and the third party products chosen by customers 

table of contents operating expenses and operating income loss 
the following table summarizes operating expenses and operating income loss for  and in thousands manufacturing hospitality total manufacturing hospitality total manufacturing hospitality total selling and marketing research and product development general and administrative purchased in process research and development restructuring related charges total operating expenses operating income loss corporate costs associated with the overall management of the company  including strategy  financing  accounting  legal  human resources  information technology  directors  insurance  marketing  public company compliance and other overhead costs  are allocated to the manufacturing and hospitality segments based on their average headcount 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expense includes the salaries  incentive compensation  employee benefits  travel and overhead costs of our sales and marketing personnel  as well as trade show activities and other marketing costs 
these expenses increased from to  and from to as we continued to expand our sales force and increased demand generation activities and business development efforts to support our strategic partnerships in we also had increased expenses due to the acquired his business 
as a percentage of revenues  selling and marketing expenses were in compared to in for the full year  we expect selling and marketing expenses to range from to of total revenue 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense includes the salaries  incentive compensation  employee benefits and related overhead costs of our finance  human resources and administrative employees  as well as legal and accounting expenses  consulting and contractor fees and bad debt expense 
while these expenses increased in from  due mostly to the acquired his business  they decreased as a percentage of revenue from to due to increased revenues 
in  total general and administrative expenses were comparable to increased costs for stock based compensation  severance related charges and lease termination costs in the uk were offset by decreased costs associated with sarbanes oxley compliance 
with continued focus on expense management and the expected growth in revenues  general and administrative expenses should be in the range of to of total revenues for the full year research and product development 
research and product development expense includes salaries  employee benefits  related overhead costs and consulting fees associated with product development  enhancements  upgrades  testing  quality assurance and documentation 
research and product development expense increased in from this was due  in large part  to expenses from our acquired his business as well as continued efforts to expand the functionality of our manufacturing and hospitality products 
research and development expense was of total revenue in compared to in research and product development expense increased in from in large part because of expenses from our acquired infra business  a proof of concept project in our manufacturing segment and continued efforts to expand functionality of our manufacturing and hospitality products 
research and development expense was of consolidated revenue in compared with in research and development expense is expected to be in the range of to of total revenue for the full year purchased in process research and development 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we had an expense of million related to purchased in process research and development which is solely related to the his acquisition  and more specifically to karyon  our distribution services provider operation  which was 
table of contents in development at the time of the acquisition and had no alternative future use 
this was valued by an independent third party  with the assistance of our management  and was based upon an income approach using the present value of future cash flow over a certain period of time 
restructuring related 
in  we recorded restructuring costs of million  which consisted of employee termination costs  including severance and associated outplacement costs resulting from the restructuring of our manufacturing software operations 
this restructuring plan is designed to improve the profitability and long term growth prospects of our manufacturing segment 
we identified positions for elimination which will be achieved through early retirement packages offered to employees  voluntary separations  and involuntary separations  as necessary 
this restructuring is scheduled to be completed by the end of our first quarter of fiscal year we anticipate net expense savings related to this restructuring of approximately million in fiscal year  inclusive of the additional resource investment in our sap business 
see note to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for a rollforward of the restructuring accruals and additional discussion of our restructuring activities 
in july  we incurred million of restructuring charges  primarily for severance costs as we reassessed the cost structure of our hospitality operations  not including his  in response to unacceptable trends with our hospitality product line 
we reduced our global hospitality work force by spread between the sales  support and development functions 
these reductions are expected to reduce annual operating expenses by approximately million 
in march  we successfully negotiated an early termination of our lease in woking  uk in exchange for all future obligations on this lease  we made a final payment of approximately million and reversed the remaining liability from our accounts  which resulted in a million credit to restructuring expense 
we also reversed approximately million of severance related restructuring accrual due to lower than expected severance costs 
during  cash payments for restructuring related items were insignificant 
during  we made cash payments of million related to employee severance and million related to lease commitments  including the closing of a south africa office late in at september   the balance of our accrued restructuring charges was approximately million 
severance payments will continue through the first part of  with the exception of million of retirement benefits for two former employees 
these benefits will take effect when the two individuals and their spouses turn  and will then be reduced over a period of years  or until the accrual runs out  whichever comes first 
non operating income and expenses  income taxes and discontinued operations 
the following table summarizes non operating income and expenses  income taxes and discontinued operations for  and in thousands interest expense other expense income  net provision for benefit from income taxes income from discontinued operations  net of tax interest expense 
interest expense was million in  million in and million in the increase from to was due to the outstanding indebtedness under our term loan and revolving credit facilities  which were outstanding for only days during the decrease from to was primarily related to institutional debt that we had incurred with a subordinated debt lender in november  which we repaid in august interest expense in included million of cash interest expense on the institutional debt  million of amortization of capitalized financing costs including million of regular monthly amortization during the year and million of accelerated amortization costs  and million of debt accretion including million of annualized monthly accretion and million of accelerated accretion due to the early payoff of this debt 
in addition  we had less than million of other interest expense on other borrowings and capital lease obligations 

table of contents other expense income  net 
other expense income  net is composed principally of interest income  the effect of foreign currency transaction gains and losses and other non operating items 
other expense income  net was insignificant in and the amount included approximately million of gain from the sale of two foreign subsidiaries including a non cash gain of million from realization of accumulated translation adjustments  million of interest income and million of foreign exchange gains 
the foreign exchange gains consist primarily of the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on intercompany payables denominated in us dollars usd 
a significant portion of our foreign exchange gain is the direct result of the change in exchange rates between the british pound and usd 
in  we also recognized less than million of foreign exchange gain on renminbi rmb due to the change in currency policy in china 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
we recorded a provision for income taxes from continuing operations of million in  compared to a provision for income taxes from continuing operations of million in and a benefit from income taxes from continuing operations of million in benefits are stated net of our estimated domestic federal and state and international tax provisions 
in  and  we recorded million  million and million of income tax expense as part of discontinued operations 
this tax expense recorded in discontinued operations is offset by a corresponding tax benefit in continuing operations for the same amount 
based upon available evidence  there is uncertainty regarding the ability to realize our deferred tax assets and we have therefore recorded a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets in our consolidated financial statements 
based on our estimates for and beyond  we believe the uncertainty regarding the ability to realize our deferred tax assets may diminish to the point where the recognition of our deferred tax assets may be warranted in the future 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded in the period when such determination is made 
net deferred tax assets of the fourth shift acquisition in were approximately million  all of which were fully reserved through a valuation allowance  thereby increasing the portion of the total purchase price allocated to goodwill 
any subsequent recognition by us of a pre acquisition tax benefit will be recorded as a reduction to goodwill as opposed to an income tax benefit in our consolidated statement of operations 
as a result  future income tax expense benefit will not be impacted by reductions of the valuation allowance related to these pre acquisition deferred tax assets 
in addition  prior to any changes in our overall assessment in the realizability of our deferred tax assets  if we generate taxable income in the us or certain other international jurisdictions and utilize pre acquisition net operating loss carry forwards to offset this income  we will recognize income tax expense at the applicable statutory rate in our consolidated statement of operations 
discontinued operations 
in accordance with the bankruptcy and reorganization plan of aremissoft corporation  our former parent  we retain a interest in net collections by the liquidating trust established to pursue litigation claims and collection of assets remaining in aremissoft after bankruptcy 
in june  we received a distribution in the amount of million from the liquidating trust that was recorded net of tax of million as income from discontinued operations 
additionally  in previous estimates of obligations related to the discontinued operations were revised  resulting in additional gain on discontinued operations of million 
because neither we nor any of our executives have any affiliation with the trust  other than our interest in net collections  we cannot predict if there will be any future distributions 
after we had separated from the parent company  we maintained an obligation in accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheet 
we reversed this accrual in the first quarter of and recorded income from discontinued operations of million  net of income taxes  in our consolidated statement of operations 
preferred stock dividend  deemed dividend on exchange of preferred stock and beneficial conversion feature 
these items impact our net income loss available to common shareholders 
in and  we recorded cash dividends from our series c convertible preferred stock series c stock  series c convertible preferred stock series c stock and series d convertible preferred stock series d stock 
in  we also recorded non cash charges for a beneficial conversion feature on the issuance of the series d stock and a deemed dividend on the exchange of our series c stock for the series c stock 
the series c 
table of contents stock was issued in august with a dividend rate of so there were very limited preferred stock dividends recorded in the series c stock was exchanged for series c stock in august which carries a dividend rate of 
the series d stock was issued in august and september and also carries a dividend rate of 
the combination of the series c stock outstanding through august at and the series c and series d stocks outstanding since august generated the preferred stock dividends of million 
we recorded a non cash charge of million related to a beneficial conversion feature on the series d stock in we sold the million face value of series d stock with a conversion price of per share  which was equal to the market price of our common stock when we closed the transaction 
therefore  the conversion feature entitles the holders of the series d stock to acquire approximately million shares of our common stock 
because we sold the series d stock with warrants to purchase our common stock  and also incurred issuance costs  the value assigned to these items was deducted from the face amount of the series d stock 
therefore  the series d stock is treated as if it were sold for less than market value and this less than market conversion value is considered a beneficial conversion feature that was recognized as a charge on the issuance date in august and september additionally  we exchanged  or extinguished the series c stock for the series c stock and recorded non cash deemed dividend of million in we had previously recorded the series c stock on our balance sheet at million  which was net of issuance costs and an amount allocated to common stock warrants 
a deemed fair value of million was assigned to the newly issued series c stock 
the million difference between the previous carrying value of the series c stock and the new fair value of the series c stock was recorded as a deemed dividend 
going forward  we anticipate that our preferred stock dividends will be approximately million per quarter 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents 
at of september   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  a decrease of million from september  our most significant source of operating cash flows is generally derived from license  maintenance and professional services revenues 
our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee costs and third party costs for services and facilities 
we had approximately million and million of renminbi  more commonly called the yuan the currency of the people s republic of china  at september  and  respectively 
the chinese government considers portions of the renminbi balance to be undistributed earnings  which contain temporary or permanent restrictions for converting to us dollars 
these amounts are reflected in cash and cash equivalents 
working capital deficit 
our working capital deficit  defined as current assets less current liabilities  was million at september  and million at september  the increase in our working capital deficit was primarily due to the decrease in cash and cash equivalents  and increases short term debt and accounts payable and accrued expenses 
also contributing to this working capital deficit is our deferred revenue balance  which primarily represents our obligation to provide future maintenance services and is not a cash obligation 
cash flows from operating activities

we generated approximately million of cash from operations in  all of it from continuing operations 
although we recorded a loss from continuing operations of million  the loss reflects the 
table of contents effect of non cash expenses  including million of purchased in process research and development  million of depreciation and amortization and million of stock based compensation 
the remaining cash provided was due to changes in our working capital accounts  excluding the effects of the mai acquisition  primarily collections of accounts receivable offset by increased prepaid expenses and other current assets  decreased accounts payable and decreased other current liabilities 
we generated million of cash from operations in  of which million was from discontinued operations 
although we recorded a loss from continuing operations of million  the loss reflects the effect of million of non cash expenses  including million of depreciation and amortization  a million non cash interest charge related to amortization and accretion of capitalized financing and original debt issuance costs offset by a million non cash income tax benefit 
the non cash interest charge includes approximately million of accelerated charges due to the early repayment of debt 
of the million of cash loss from continuing operations  adjusted for non cash items  we used million to reduce deferred revenue 
the deferred revenue decrease is consistent with the revenue decrease in our hospitality group 
overall we used cash in continuing operations in the amount of million 
in june  we received a cash distribution of million from the liquidating trust of aremissoft in which we retain a interest in net collections that is reflected as cash from discontinued operations  net of certain other expenses and taxes

each share of the series c stock had a nominal face value of  carried a mandatory dividend  whether or not earned or declared  of of its face value per annum paid in two semi annual installments  commencing december   had a liquidation preference over common stock and on a par with our series b convertible preferred stock series b stock equal to its face value plus accrued and unpaid dividends  was convertible into common stock at any time at per share  subject to price anti dilution protection on a weighted average basis for new issuances by us below the conversion price or below of market price  and could be redeemed by us at par plus accrued dividends  or automatically converted into common stock  commencing august   subject to satisfaction of a number of conditions  including market price conditions 
the warrants are exercisable at per share  subject to the same price anti dilution provisions  contain cashless exercise rights and expire on august  the net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of the series c stock and associated warrants were recorded as an increase to stockholders equity 

table of contents on august   to finance the acquisition of mai and its subsidiary his  we executed a credit agreement with wells fargo foothill  inc as arranger and administrative agent  providing us a million term loan and a revolving credit facility for up to million of additional borrowing based on of our maintenance revenue  sold to abry  shares of series d stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock for million  and exchanged  shares of series c stock for the  shares of series c stock previously outstanding 
the term loan under the credit agreement is repayable in equal monthly installments  which began april  all borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest  payable monthly  ranging from to over the lenders prime rate or from to over the london interbank rate  depending on our level of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for the twelve months preceding the monthly calculation date 
borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by all of the assets of our united states subsidiaries and of the stock of our non united states subsidiaries 
at september   we had borrowings outstanding under the term loan facility of million  at an interest rate of per annum  and under the revolving line of credit of million  at an interest rate of per annum 
the series d stock also has a nominal face value of  carries a mandatory dividend of of its face value per annum  has a liquidation preference over common stock and on a par with the series b stock and series c stock equal to its face value plus accrued and unpaid dividends  is convertible into common stock at any time at per share  subject to price anti dilution protection on a weighted average basis for new issuances by us below the conversion price or below of market price  and can be redeemed by us at par plus accrued dividends  or automatically converted into common stock  commencing august   subject to satisfaction of a number of conditions  including market price conditions 
the warrants are exercisable at per share  subject to the same price anti dilution provisions  contain cashless exercise rights and expire on august  the series c stock is identical to the series c stock except that it carries dividends of rather than 
we sold an additional  shares of series d stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock to crp on september  commitments and capital adequacy as of september   our primary commitments are for leased office space and payments on our long term debt obligations 
we had no significant commitments for capital expenditures 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at september  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands payments due by period less than more than total year years years years long term obligations operating lease obligations cash interest on long term obligations total contractual obligations in early december  we signed an agreement to sublease our minneapolis facility  whereby the new tenant will assume of our current lease costs  and we will pay  through january the remaining lease term 
we expect to record a charge related to this sublease agreement of approximately million in the second quarter of concurrent with this agreement  we signed an agreement to lease a new headquarters facility beginning in january the new location in minneapolis is approximately 
table of contents  square feet and we are taking over a sublease that goes through december these changes are not reflected in the above table of contractual obligations 
we believe that cash flows from operations together with our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our commitments and our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
our working capital deficit current assets less current liabilities of million at september   included a current liability of million for deferred revenue representing our obligation to provide future maintenance services 
we typically satisfy our obligations for maintenance services at a cost of approximately to of the deferred revenue and fund the cost of that obligation from cash flow and from renewals from the next subsequent annual contract period for the maintenance contracts 
our credit agreement requires us to satisfy specific financial and operational covenants 
if we violate these covenants  the credit agreement provides that the lenders may accelerate and require us to immediately repay the indebtedness 
because the credit agreement is secured by all of our assets  the lender could also proceed to foreclose and begin disposing of some of those assets 
in particular  we are required to maintain  at the end of each calendar quarter  a level of ebitda generated for the trailing months increasing from million at september   to million for the month periods ending september  for the twelve month period ended september   our ebitda calculated in accordance with our credit agreement was million 
we are required to maintain a ratio of the difference between ebitda and capital expenditures to fixed charges over the same periods ranging from to we are required to limit our capital expenditures during any month period to amounts of million in fiscal and million for the month periods ending on and after september  among other matters  we are prohibited without the consent of the administrative agent under the credit agreement i from incurring debt except subordinated debt of approximately million  ii from subjecting our assets to any liens or encumbrances  except certain permitted liens  iii from engaging in a sale of assets except in the ordinary course  iv from changing our name or the nature of our business  v from making investments  and vi from engaging in transaction with affiliates 
we have been required to maintain certain percentages of our cash and cash equivalents in the united states and we are currently working with our lender to revise these percentages to be more reasonable aligned with our capabilities and foreign investment needs 
although we are currently in compliance with all of the covenants in that agreement and expect that we will continue to comply with the covenants during the coming months  we have been required to renegotiate debt agreements in the past when we expected that our operations would not satisfy the covenants 
we cannot be certain that  if we were to violate the credit agreement  the lenders would be agreeable to renegotiation  and if they were not  we would be required to find alternative financing to repay the debt  or risk that the lender would seek to dispose of some or all of our assets to repay the debt 
we currently do not have arrangements for alternative financing  and if we were forced to obtain financing in a short period of time to avoid default  financing might not be available at all  or the terms of that financing might be very disadvantageous to us and to our stockholders 
we believe it is probable we will meet our covenants under the credit agreement through september  off balance sheet arrangements as of september   we did not engage in any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a of regulation s k under the securities act of  as amended  that have  or are likely to have  a material current or future effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations
