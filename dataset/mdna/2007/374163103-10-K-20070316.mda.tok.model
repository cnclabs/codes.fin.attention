the restatement results from our review of recent guidance relating to emerging issues task force issue  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  issue 
recent guidance described the application of issue  particularly the provisions related to settlement in unregistered shares and registered shares and timely filing and registration requirements under us securities laws 
in order for a warrant to be classified as permanent equity under issue  the settlement of such warrant in shares must be within the company s control 
we have issued certain warrants to purchase shares of our common stock in connection with equity financings pursuant to effective shelf registration statements  and the holders of such warrants have the right to exercise them for cash and to receive registered shares upon such exercise 
in connection with the issuance of these warrants  we agreed to file timely any reports required under the securities exchange act of  as amended  to enable the delivery of registered shares upon exercise of these warrants 
issue states that the ability to make timely filings and  therefore the delivery of registered shares  is not within the control of a company 
as a result  issue presumes net cash settlement  thus requiring these warrants to purchase shares of our common stock issued in connection with equity financings pursuant to effective shelf registration statements to be considered liabilities 
we have reported and restated prior consolidated balance sheets to account for the value of these warrants to purchase shares of our common stock as a liability  and have restated prior consolidated statements of operations for the quarterly change in fair value of the warrants 
this restatement had no impact on previously reported revenues  operating expenses  total assets or cash position

major technology platforms telomeres and telomerase role in cellular aging and cancer cells are the building blocks for all tissues in the human body and cell division plays a critical role in the normal growth  maintenance and repair of human tissue 
however  in the human body  most cell division is a limited process 
depending on the tissue type  cells generally divide only to times during the course of their normal lifespan 
we and our collaborators have shown that telomeres  located at the ends of chromosomes  are key genetic elements involved in the regulation of the cellular aging process 
our work has shown that each time a normal cell divides  telomeres shorten 
once telomeres reach a certain short length  cell division halts and the cell enters a state known as replicative senescence or aging 
thus  this shortening of the telomeres effectively serves as a molecular clock for cellular aging 
we and others have shown that when the enzyme telomerase is introduced into normal cells  it can restore telomere length reset the clock thereby increasing the functional lifespan of the cells 
importantly  it does this without altering the cells biology or causing them to become cancerous 
human telomerase  a complex enzyme  is composed of a ribonucleic acid rna component  known as htr  a protein component  known as htert  and other accessory proteins 
in  we cloned the gene for htr  and in  in collaboration with dr 
thomas cech  we cloned the gene for htert 
our work and that of others has shown that telomerase is not present  or is present at very low levels  in most normal cells and tissues  but that during cancer progression  telomerase is abnormally reactivated in all major cancer types 
we have shown that while telomerase does not cause cancer which is caused by mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes  the continued presence of telomerase enables cancer cells to maintain telomere length  providing them with indefinite replicative capacity 
we and others have shown in various tumor models that inhibiting telomerase activity results in telomere shortening and causes aging or death of the cancer cell 
although telomerase is expressed in nearly all cancer cells  it is not expressed in most normal cells 
that gives telomerase the potential of being both a universal as well as a highly specific cancer target 
this specificity means that drugs and biologics that attack cancer cells by targeting telomerase may leave other cells unaffected  and thus should have fewer side effects than conventional chemotherapeutic agents that typically attack both cancer and non cancer cells 
we are developing anti cancer therapies based on telomerase inhibitors  telomerase therapeutic vaccines and  through our licensee  telomerase based oncolytic cancer killing viruses 
through our licensees  we also intend to continue to develop and commercialize products using telomerase as a marker for cancer diagnosis  prognosis  patient monitoring and screening 
we are also developing drugs that activate telomerase in certain cells to enhance cell repair function in senescent tissues implicated in certain chronic diseases 
human embryonic stem cells a potential source for the manufacturing of replacement cells and tissues stem cells generally are self renewing primitive cells that can develop into functional  differentiated cells 
human embryonic stem cells hescs  which are derived from very early stage embryos called blastocysts  are unique because they are pluripotent  which means they can develop into all cells and tissues in the body  and they self renew indefinitely in the undifferentiated state 
the ability of hescs to divide indefinitely in the undifferentiated state without losing pluripotency is a unique characteristic that distinguishes them from all other stem cells discovered to date in humans 
we have demonstrated that hescs express telomerase continuously  a characteristic of immortal cells 
other stem cells such as blood or gut stem cells express telomerase at very low levels or only periodically  they therefore age  limiting their use in research or therapeutic applications 
hescs can be expanded in culture indefinitely and hence can be banked for scaled product manufacture 
we intend to use human embryonic stem cell technology to enable the development of transplantation therapies by providing standard starting material for the manufacture of cells and tissues  facilitate pharmaceutical research and development practices by providing cells for disease models and screening  and for assigning function to newly discovered genes  and accelerate research in human developmental biology by identifying the genes that control human growth and development 
commercial opportunities for our major technology platforms oncology cancer is a group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells 
the american cancer society estimated that approximately million new cancer cases were diagnosed in overall annual costs associated with cancer in were an estimated billion in the united states alone 
because telomerase is detectable in more than human cancer types and in the great majority of cancer samples studied  we believe that telomerase based drugs could overcome the limitations of current cancer therapies and potentially be broadly applicable and highly specific drug treatments for cancer 
we  our collaborators and our licensees are developing a range of anti cancer therapies  including anti cancer therapies based on telomerase inhibitors  telomerase therapeutic vaccines and telomerase based oncolytic cancer killing viruses  and diagnostics based on telomerase detection 
we believe telomerase is an ideal target for cancer therapeutics and diagnostics because it appears to be universal expressed in all major types of cancers studied to date  specific not expressed in most normal cells  and critical required for long term survival of cancer cells 
we believe that we have the dominant patent position in the field of telomerase 
whether it is achieved by us or by our collaborators and licensees  we believe that progress in the development of any of these telomerase based cancer therapeutics will further validate the importance of telomerase as a cancer target and therefore benefit all of our telomerase cancer programs

telomerase activation is necessary for most cancer cells to replicate indefinitely and thereby enable tumor growth and metastasis 
one of our strategies for the development of anti cancer therapies is to inhibit telomerase activity in cancer cells 
inhibiting telomerase activity should result in telomere shortening and therefore cause aging and death of cancer cells 
recent data show that telomerase can protect tumor cells from genomic instability and other forms of cellular stress  suggesting that inhibiting telomerase can cause a more rapid suppression of tumor growth than predicted by telomere loss alone 
because telomerase is expressed at very low levels  if at all  in most normal cells  the telomerase inhibition therapies described below are not expected to be toxic to most normal cells 
we have designed and synthesized a special class of short chain nucleic acid molecules  known as oligonucleotides  which target the template region  or active site  of telomerase 
our work has focused on two of these oligonucleotides  called grn and grnl  and we have demonstrated that they have highly potent telomerase inhibitory activity at very low concentrations in biochemical assays  various cellular systems and animal studies 
our compounds grn and grnl are direct enzyme inhibitors  not antisense compounds 
they are smaller lower molecular weight than typical antisense compounds or other oligonucleotide drug candidates  and we expect them to be administered either locally or systemically 
in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that the compounds do not inhibit other critical nucleic acid modifying enzymes and do not appear to be toxic to normal cells at concentrations expected to inhibit telomerase in tumor cells 
both compounds use a special thiophosphoramidate chemical backbone  for which we acquired key patents in march from lynx therapeutics 
we and our collaborators have tested grn in vitro on different cancer cells and demonstrated significant inhibition of telomerase activity in all of them 
research by our collaborators has shown that these compounds inhibit the growth of malignant human glioblastoma brain cancer cells  prostate cancer cells  lymphoma  multiple myeloma  hepatocellular carcinoma liver cancer  melanoma  lung  breast  ovarian and cervical cancer cells in animals 
grnl is identical in structure to grn except that it has a lipid molecule permanently attached to one end of the molecule  which increases potency and improves its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties 
the improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of grnl suggest that it should be effective in inhibiting telomerase in tumor cells when administered intermittently eg  once per week 
grnl is a potent inhibitor of telomerase and was selected as our lead compound to take forward into the clinic 
inhibition of telomerase activity by grnl in cancer cells results in telomere shortening  and leads to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis 
grnl is a mer oligonucleotide n p thio phosphoramidate nps oligonucleotide that is covalently attached to a c palmitoyl lipid moiety 
grnl binds directly with high affinity to the template region of the rna component of human telomerase htr  which lies in the active or catalytic site of htert  the telomerase reverse transcriptase 
grnl binding to htr results in direct  competitive inhibition of telomerase enzymatic activity 
the mechanism of action of the drug is not antisense mediated 
grnl has been characterized preclinically and shown to inhibit telomerase in human tumor cells of many cancer types  in both cell culture systems and animal models 
these studies continue to demonstrate broad anti tumor activity of grnl  alone and in combination with other anti tumor agents including chemotherapy and radiotherapy  and support the potential utility of grnl in the treatment of patients with hematologic and solid tumor malignancies 
after completing a series of animal toxicology and preclinical efficacy studies of grnl in  we prepared and submitted an investigational new drug ind application to the us food and drug administration fda to begin human clinical trials of grnl in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia cll 
we received fda concurrence to begin human studies and four clinical sites are currently designated as patient enrollment centers for the study 
in  under our existing grnl ind  we initiated a second phase i study in patients with solid tumor cancers 
at the end of  we presented data at two international cancer meetings on the low dose cohorts of these studies  which showed safety and tolerability as well as the expected pharmacokinetic properties after multiple intravenous infusions of the drug 
we also presented important new data showing that grnl is active against tumor stem cells taken from patients with multiple myeloma 
we believe that this data is the first evidence of any drug that may be active against chemotherapy resistant cancer stem cells  which are responsible for clinical relapse 
based on this finding  as well as data showing synergy between grnl and a drug widely used to treat multiple myeloma  we are planning to initiate an additional phase i ii study in multiple myeloma in we are also planning to initiate a phase i ii study in lung cancer in the coming year 
telomerase therapeutic vaccine grnvac 
the goal of therapeutic cancer vaccines is to teach the patient s own immune system to attack cancer cells while sparing other cells 
this is done by repeatedly exposing the immune system to a substance antigen that is specific to cancer cells in a way that subsequently induces an immune response to any cells that express that antigen on their surface 
we believe that the characteristics of telomerase make it an ideal antigen for cancer vaccines 
at duke university medical center  a phase i ii clinical trial in prostate cancer patients concluded in march and additional phase i ii optimization trials for patients with hematologic  prostate and renal cancers concluded in the duke phase i ii clinical trials used an ex vivo process in which dendritic cells the body s most powerful antigen presenting cells were isolated from the patient s blood  pulsed with rna for the telomerase protein component  and then injected into the patient s skin  where they traveled to the lymph nodes and instructed cytotoxic t cells to kill tumor cells that express telomerase 
data from these early human clinical trials confirmed and optimized the safety and efficacy of telomerase vaccine therapies 
the first clinical trial at duke university medical center was designed to enroll up to a total of patients with metastatic prostate cancer  up to of whom would receive three weekly vaccinations low dose group  and up to of whom would receive six weekly vaccinations high dose group 
twenty three patients were enrolled and treated  and results of this study for patients of the low dose group and eight of the high dose group were published in the journal of immunology in march as reported by the investigator  none of the patients in either group had significant treatment related adverse effects 
all but one of the patients in the low dose group showed a significant cellular immune response specific to telomerase 
the eight patients in the high dose group all showed very robust cellular immune responses to telomerase based on tests assessing the generation of telomerase specific cytotoxic cd t lymphocytes  as well as cd lymphocytes 
the immune responses in the high dose group were strong as well as specific peak responses were of circulating cd t cells having anti telomerase activity 
circulating cancer cells were also measured before and after vaccination 
the data suggested that of ten subjects who had elevated levels of circulating prostate cancer cells before vaccination  nine of these ten had their levels reduced or cleared transiently after vaccination 
serum psa was measured before  during and multiple times after vaccination to calculate psa doubling time as a surrogate marker for treatment response 
no significant change in psa doubling time after vaccination was reported in the low dose group 
a highly significant increase in psa doubling time was reported in the high dose group  suggestive of a clinical response to vaccination 
several small additional phase i ii trials for patients with prostate cancer  hematologic malignancies and renal cell carcinoma were performed at duke in order to optimize the vaccination process 
in the trials  a number of parameters were tested  including i the pre vaccination administration of an approved compound to potentially augment vaccine potency  ii the use of a second approved compound applied to the vaccine injection site to potentially enable the use of dendritic cells produced by an alternative manufacturing process and  iii the use of boost vaccinations to potentially enhance the durability of the anti telomerase immune response 
additionally  we have brought the vaccine manufacturing process in house for further optimization and transferred it to a contract manufacturer 
in  we filed our own ind to initiate a phase i ii clinical trial of the telomerase vaccine using the prime boost vaccination protocol in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia aml 
we received fda concurrence for that ind in december and we are in the process of initiating multiple trial sites to begin enrolling patients into that study 
in  we acquired rights from argos therapeutics  inc formerly merix to commercialize the ex vivo dendritic cell processing technology used in the duke clinical trials for telomerase and other defined tumor specific antigens 
we own the rights to the telomerase antigen and its use in therapeutic vaccines 
in  we licensed rights from immunomic therapeutics inc to the lamp antigen targeting sequence for use in cancer vaccines 
the lamp sequence causes an antigen to which it is attached to be taken up by the lysosomal subcellular compartment of the cell 
this has been shown to increase presentation on mhc class ii molecules  which in turn  can produce greater cd t cell responses against the antigen and a more potent and longer lasting overall immune response 
also in  we entered into a worldwide exclusive license and collaboration agreement with the university of oxford to produce dendritic cells from hescs 
the scalable production of dendritic cells from hescs could serve as an alternative to isolating dendritic cells from each patient  and possibly as a broadly useful vaccine delivery vehicle 
in another form  dendritic cells may act to block an immune response against an antigen by teaching the immune system not to attack it a process known as tolerizing the individual to that antigen 
since the same pluripotent hesc line could be used to generate both tolerizing dendritic cells and therapeutic cells  co administration of these two cell populations could potentially circumvent immune rejection without the need for immunosuppressive drugs 
in july  we entered into a worldwide exclusive research  development and commercialization license agreement with merck co  inc for cancer vaccines targeting telomerase by methods other than dendritic cell delivery 
in addition  merck acquired an exclusive option to negotiate a separate agreement for our dendritic cell based telomerase vaccine 
oncolytic virus ov cg 
a third telomerase based anti cancer therapeutic strategy utilizes viruses that have been manipulated or engineered to have oncolytic  or cancer killing  properties  enabling them to selectively target and destroy cancer cells that express telomerase 
we cloned the promoter region of the telomerase gene and have shown that it can be used to regulate genes required for the virus to replicate within the cancer cell 
our data indicate that when tumor cells are infected with the virus  the telomerase promoter is active and the virus multiplies or replicates within the cancer cells and causes the rupture and death of the tumor cells 
when these same engineered viruses infect normal somatic cells  the telomerase promoter is inactive and there is no killing effect and the virus dissipates 
this selective lytic effect on cancer has been demonstrated in vitro in seven different tumor types prostate  liver  lung  pancreatic  colorectal  breast and ovarian cancers 
these in vitro results have been extended to animal models of liver and prostate cancer with similar effects against the animals tumors while sparing normal cells 
we initially granted a non exclusive license to genetic therapy  inc gti  a subsidiary of novartis ag  to use our telomerase promoter technology to develop an oncolytic virus product 
subsequently  gti s oncolytic virus business including our license to gti was acquired by cell genesys inc  which also has its own oncolytic virus program and has continued the research and development of a potential oncolytic virus product 
cancer diagnostics telomerase plus test 
telomerase is a broadly applicable and highly specific marker for cancer because it has been detected in more than human cancer types and in the great majority of cancer samples studied 
we believe that the detection of telomerase may have significant clinical utility for cancer diagnosis  prognosis  monitoring and screening 
current cancer diagnostics apply only to a single or limited number of cancer types because they rely on molecules expressed only by particular cancer types 
however  telomerase based diagnostics could potentially address a broad range of cancers 
we have developed several proprietary assays for the detection of telomerase which are based on its activity or the presence of its rna or protein components 
the first generation assay is the telomeric repeat amplification protocol trap assay which can be used to detect telomerase activity in human tissue or cells  including clinical samples 
the second generation assays detect the presence of htr and htert in human tissues and body fluids 
we own issued patents for the detection of telomerase activity and the components of telomerase  including patents for the trap assay and diagnostic methods based on telomerase detection 
to date  our licensees have commercialized research use only kits that incorporate our technology 
through roche diagnostics  we are participating in the development of fluids based telomerase detection tests for clinical in vitro diagnostics 
the tests are based on telomerase detection assays that have been commercialized for the research use only market 
roche is investigating the utility of an assay for telomerase for detecting bladder cancer  with potential utility in early detection screening and monitoring of patients for recurrence 
patients who have had bladder cancer now periodically undergo invasive cystoscopy to screen for recurrence 
telomerase activation we are developing drug candidates to treat various degenerative diseases by the controlled activation of telomerase 
data published by us and others has indicated that cellular aging caused by shortening telomeres  which occurs in numerous tissues throughout the human body  causes or contributes to chronic degenerative diseases and conditions including anemia  hiv aids  liver disease  macular degeneration a chronic disease of the eyes often leading to vision loss  atherosclerosis narrowing of arteries which reduces blood flow to internal organs and impaired wound healing 
controlled activation of telomerase in normal cells can restore telomere length or slow the rate of loss  improve functional capacity  and increase the proliferative lifespan of cells 
compound product disease development product description treatment stage tat telomerase activator hiv aids preclinical hiv aids tat 
work by our collaborators has shown that telomere loss in cytotoxic t lymphocytes  the blood cells responsible for killing hiv infected cells  is accelerated in hiv aids patients  and contributes to the loss of anti hiv activity that occurs during disease progression 
our collaborators published data showing that telomerase activation using overexpression of htert  the catalytic component of telomerase  in t lymphocytes both increased their lifespan and significantly enhanced their anti hiv activity 
these results were extended in a subsequent publication which showed that telomerase activation in bulk cultures of lymphocytes from hiv patients enhanced hiv suppressing activity and improved the production of antiviral cytokines in response to hiv specific stimulation 
these results show that telomere shortening in hiv specific lymphocytes plays a major role in the immune dysfunction seen in late stage hiv disease and that telomerase activation  by enhancing the anti hiv effects of cd lymphocytes  is potentially a therapy for treating patients with hiv disease 
our approach to the therapeutic use of telomerase activation in hiv aids and other chronic diseases is based upon small molecule telomerase activators we have identified tat and tat 
we have tested these telomerase activating drugs for enhancement of antiviral activity in lymphocytes from hiv patients 
at several scientific meetings  we and our collaborators presented data showing that our two small molecule telomerase activators  tat and tat formerly grn and grn  activated telomerase in vitro in cytotoxic t cells taken from hiv aids donors 
moreover  the compounds increased the proliferative capacity  the secretion of gamma interferon a virus fighting molecule and the direct cytotoxic killing of hiv infected cd t cells when these treated cells were exposed to hiv peptides or hiv infected cells 
in  we formed a joint venture company  ta therapeutics  ltd 
tat  with the biotechnology research corporation brc of hong kong  a company established by the hong kong university of science and technology 
tat conducts research and was established to commercially develop products that utilize telomerase activator drugs to restore the regenerative and functional capacity of cells in various organ systems that have been impacted by senescence  injury or chronic disease 
tat is owned by geron and by brc  our research partner in the development of telomerase activator drugs 
tat selected the tat compound for clinical development in scalable drug product manufacturing has been secured in china and ind enabling studies are now in progress for the first indication hiv aids 
follow on indications for development of tat in other diseases are being explored 
human embryonic stem cell therapies the two properties of hescs  their immortality and pluripotency  enable the development of a potential new mode of commercialization for cell based products and therapeutics  namely the development of off the shelf products available on demand 
we have developed proprietary methods to grow  maintain  and scale the culture of undifferentiated hescs that use feeder cell free and serum free media with chemically defined components 
moreover  we have developed scalable processes to differentiate these cells into therapeutically relevant cells 
we have developed cryopreserved formulations of hesc derived cells to enable our business model of delivering on demand cells for therapeutic use 
we are now testing six different hesc derived therapeutic cell types in animal models 
in four of these cell types  we have demonstrated efficacy as evidenced by durable engraftment or functional improvements of the treated animals 
from these studies  we are now advancing development of two hesc based therapeutics to clinical testing 
the most advanced hesc derived product  grnopc  which contains oligodendroglial progenitor cells  is targeted for the treatment of spinal cord injury 
geron s second hesc product  grncm  is a population of cardiomyocytes  the contractile cells of the heart  which is intended for the treatment of patients with myocardial disease 
geron also has made substantial progress in deriving pancreatic islet cells for diabetes  osteoblasts for osteoporosis  chondrocytes for osteoarthritis  hepatocytes for liver failure and adme drug testing  and dendritic cells for two applications including  cancer immunotherapy and graft acceptance to prevent immune rejection of the other cell types used in therapeutic applications

the major neural cells of the central nervous system typically do not regenerate after injury 
if a nerve cell is damaged due to disease or injury  there is no treatment at present to restore lost function 
patients worldwide suffer from injury to the nervous system or disorders associated with its degeneration 
in the case of spinal cord injuries  patients are often left partly or wholly paralyzed because nerve and supporting cells in the spinal cord have been damaged and cannot regenerate 
such patients are permanently disabled  often institutionalized and may require life support 
embryonic stem cell derived neural cells have been used by researchers to treat nervous system disorders in animal models 
in the case of spinal cord injuries  neural cells derived from animal embryonic stem cells and injected into the spinal cord injury site produced significant recovery of the animal s ability to move and bear weight 
to apply those observations to humans  we have now derived oligodendroglial progenitor cells grnopc from hescs in culture and tested them in a rat model of spinal cord injury 
in our collaboration with researchers at the university of california  irvine  we have shown in animal models that grnopc can improve functional locomotor behavior after implantation in the injury sites days after injury 
histological analysis also provided evidence for the engraftment and function of these cells 
these data were published in may in the journal of neuroscience 
we have developed functional cryopreserved formulations of grnopc that can be readily implemented in clinical trials and have initiated cgmp production of grnopc we are currently completing ind enabling studies for hesc derived oligodendrocytes for application in spinal cord injury 
cardiomyocytes for heart disease grncm 
heart muscle cells cardiomyocytes do not regenerate during adult life 
when heart muscle is damaged by injury or decreased blood flow  functional contracting heart muscle is replaced with nonfunctional scar tissue 
congestive heart failure  a common consequence of heart muscle or valve damage  affects approximately million people in the united states 
this year  it is estimated that about million people will have a heart attack  which is the primary cause of heart muscle damage 
we can potentially treat heart disease by using cardiomyocytes derived from hescs 
researchers have demonstrated proof of concept of this approach in mice 
mouse embryonic stem cells have been used to derive mouse cardiomyocytes 
when injected into the hearts of recipient adult mice  the cardiomyocytes repopulated the heart tissue and stably integrated into the muscle tissue of the adult mouse heart 
in human medicine  it is therefore possible that hesc derived cardiomyocytes could be developed for cellular transplantation therapy in humans suffering from congestive heart failure and the damage caused by heart attacks 
we have derived human cardiomyocytes from hescs grncm using a process that can be scaled for clinical production 
grncm has normal contractile function and responds appropriately to cardiac drugs 
we have transplanted these cells into animal models of myocardial infarction in which the cells engraft and improve the left ventricular function compared to those animals receiving injections without cells 
in  we will be testing grncm in large animal models of heart disease 
islet cells for diabetes grnic 
it is estimated that there are as many as one million americans suffering from type diabetes insulin dependent diabetes mellitus 
normally  certain cells in the pancreas  called the islet cells  produce insulin which promotes the uptake of the sugar glucose by cells in the human body 
degeneration of pancreatic islet cells results in a lack of insulin in the bloodstream which results in diabetes 
although diabetics can be treated with daily injections of insulin  these injections enable only intermittent glucose control 
as a result  patients with diabetes suffer chronic degeneration of many organs  including the eye  kidney  nerves and blood vessels 
in some cases  patients with diabetes have been treated with islet cell transplantation derived from cadavers 
however  poor availability of suitable sources for islet cell transplantation and the complications of the required co administration of immunosuppressive drugs make this approach impractical as a treatment for the growing numbers of individuals suffering from diabetes 
we have derived insulin producing cells ie similar to pancreatic islet cells from hescs and are working to improve the yield of islet cells and characterize their secretion of insulin in response to glucose 
we are transplanting the islets to animal models of diabetes and early results show prolonged survival of cells in the engrafted animals and the detection of human insulin in their blood 
osteoblasts for osteoporosis and non union bone fractures 
osteoporosis  or loss of bone density  is a common condition associated with aging and hormonal changes in post menopausal women 
in addition to skeletal deformities  back pain and loss of height  the disease causes over million fractures per year in the united states alone 
these fractures often occur after minimal trauma and if severe  as in hip fracture  carry mortality rates as high as for patients age and over 
nearly one in five hip fracture patients ends up in a nursing home 
total health care costs for osteoporosis and its complications are estimated at billion per year in the united states 
the primary cause of the disease is metabolic bone loss mediated by osteoclasts cells which resorb bone that is incompletely compensated by new bone formation mediated by osteoblasts cells which form new bone 
osteoblast activity declines over the human lifespan and fails to keep pace with the increasing activity of osteoclasts  resulting in progressive loss of bone density leading to fracture  pain and deformity 
we have made osteoblasts from hescs and are now conducting preclinical tests in animals 
if these preclinical tests are successful  we may test the cells in patients with non union fractures fractures of the long bones of the leg or arm that do not heal or in patients with severe refractory osteoporosis 
chondrocytes for osteoarthritis 
osteoarthritis  or degenerative joint disease  is an extremely common condition characterized by degradation of cartilage in joints  often accompanied by bone remodeling and bone overgrowth at the affected joints 
the disease affects an estimated million adults in the united states  mostly after age the disease has many causes  but the end result is a structural degradation of joint cartilage and a failure of chondrocytes cartilage forming cells to repair the degraded cartilage collagen matrix 
we have derived chondrocytes from hescs and  if in vitro and animal testing results are positive  we may test these cells in patients with osteoarthritis by injecting them directly into the affected joints 
dendritic cells for cancer immunotherapy and to enable therapeutic graft acceptance 
the hematopoietic system the circulating cells of blood is one of the tissues of the human body that can replenish itself throughout life 
one of the cell types produced by the hematopoietic system is the dendritic cell 
dendritic cells  depending on their type can either induce or downmodulate immune responses 
therefore  dendritic cells derived from hescs can be used for two purposes i to upregulate immune responses to particular antigens such as telomerase  for cancer immunotherapy applications  and ii to prevent rejection of hesc derived therapeutic grafts 
we are now developing procedures to differentiate hescs to dendritic cells which will subsequently be used in both in vitro and animal models to assess their immunotherapeutic and immunomodulatory activity 
products for research and development immortalized cells for research 
scientists study specific cells from targeted tissues in order to understand their biological function 
for these studies  cells are usually isolated from tissue and maintained in culture 
the progressive changes in biological activity  morphology and proliferation as a result of normal cell aging in tissue culture potentially limit the utility of these cells in serial experiments and long term research 
because of these limitations  most research laboratories utilize transformed cell lines for their studies 
cells can be transformed by using viruses which ultimately cause the cells to grow indefinitely in culture 
however  such immortalized cell lines have abnormal characteristics compared to non transformed cells 
for this reason  they are not good models of normal tissue in the human body 
telomerase immortalized cells may be ideal for use in biological research because these cells proliferate indefinitely and function in culture in the same manner as the normal  mortal cells from which they were derived 
moreover  telomerase immortalized cells can function in the body to form normal tissue and their capacity to differentiate into mature tissue is maintained 
the ability of these cells to maintain normal physical and biological characteristics while retaining proliferative capacity allows them to be a constant source of cells for repeat and long term studies of the function of cells both in culture and in the body 
telomerase immortalized cells can be used to study any of the normal biological pathways in cells and can be used to screen for factors which influence the appropriate function of those cells 
moreover  cells taken from diseased tissues which are then telomerase immortalized in culture can be used to explore the mechanism of the disease process and to develop interventions to prevent or treat that disease 
we are making telomerase immortalized cell lines commercially available to the research market and to companies for basic research and for use in drug discovery and biologics production applications 
we have granted royalty bearing licenses to the american type culture collection and cambrex biosciences under which these organizations will produce and sell telomerase immortalized cells for both academic research and commercial drug discovery 
hesc derived hepatocytes for drug screening and toxicology 
three of the major hurdles of pharmaceutical drug development are i identifying compounds with activity in diseased tissue  ii understanding the metabolism and biodistribution of the compound  and iii determining the potential toxic side effects of the compound 
undesirable activity of a compound being evaluated as a drug candidate in any one of these areas can impact the development and commercialization of the drug 
the earlier in development that a compound is found to have undesirable characteristics  the faster these characteristics can be potentially corrected 
this potentially translates into reduced costs and time in drug development  and less harmful patient exposure in clinical trials 
many prospective new drugs fail in clinical trials because of toxicity to the liver or because of poor uptake  distribution or elimination of the active compound in the human body 
much of the efficacy and safety of a drug will depend on how that drug is metabolized into an active or inactive form  and on the toxic metabolites that might be generated in the process 
hepatocytes  the major cells of the liver  metabolize most compounds and thereby can be used to predict many pharmacological characteristics of a drug 
there are no completely effective systems available today to accurately predict the metabolism or toxicity of a compound in human livers 
rat and mouse metabolism models only approximate human metabolism 
the development of several drugs has been terminated late in human clinical trials because rodent systems utilized early in the development process failed to predict that the drug would be toxic to humans 
human hepatocyte cell lines available today do not have the same attributes as their normal counterparts in the body and must be transformed in order to maintain their proliferative capacity in culture 
access to fresh primary human liver tissue for use in toxicity studies is very limited and substantial variability can be observed depending on the individual donor  the time and process of collection and the culture conditions for the experiments 
we are developing methods to derive standardized functional hepatocytes liver cells from hescs to address the significant unmet need for a reliable predictor of the metabolism  biodistribution and toxicity of drug development candidates 
if we are successful  these cells would provide a consistent source of normal human liver cells that can reliably predict how a new drug will affect the livers of the people who take it 
we believe that an unlimited supply of human hepatocytes  which retain normal drug metabolizing enzyme activity  would address one of the largest bottlenecks in new drug research and accelerate the drug development process 
in addition  the availability of hepatocytes from numerous individuals would allow a more thorough understanding of the effects of a drug candidate on a specific individual  promoting development of the field of pharmacogenomics the study of how a compound s activity varies with an individual s genetic make up 
our scientists have succeeded in demonstrating that hepatocyte like cells derived from hescs express normal markers of hepatocyte function  including phase and phase drug metabolizing enzymes 
we have been awarded a us patent covering human hepatocytes derived from hescs and a second us patent covering the use of hesc derived hepatocytes for drug screening 
nuclear transfer agriculture xenotransplantation biologics nuclear transfer is a method for producing animals whose nuclear genetic material is derived solely from a donor cell from an individual animal clones 
in this process  the nucleus containing the chromosomal dna is removed from the animal egg cell and subsequently replaced with a nucleus from a donor somatic non reproductive cell 
fusion between the resulting egg cell and the donor somatic nucleus results in a new cell which gains a complete set of chromosomes derived entirely from the donor nucleus 
mitochondrial dna  providing some of the genes for energy production  resides outside the nucleus and is provided by the egg 
after a brief culture period that enables the reconstituted egg cell to initiate embryonic development  the early embryo is implanted into the uterus of a female animal  where it can fully develop and result in the live birth of a cloned offspring animal 
the offspring is essentially a genetic clone of genetically identical to the animal from which the donor nucleus was obtained 
in early  dr 
ian wilmut and his colleagues at the roslin institute were the first to demonstrate  with the birth of dolly the sheep  that the nucleus of an adult cell can be transferred to an enucleated egg to create cloned offspring 
the birth of dolly was significant because it demonstrated the ability of egg cell cytoplasm  the portion of the egg outside of the nucleus  to reprogram an adult somatic nucleus 
reprogramming enables the adult somatic cell nucleus to express all the genes required for the full embryonic development of the animal 
in addition to sheep  the technique has been used to clone mice  rats  goats  cattle  rabbits  cats and pigs from donor cells and enucleated eggs from each respective animal species 
in  we acquired roslin bio med ltd  a commercial subsidiary of the roslin institute  and an exclusive license to the use of nuclear transfer technology for multiple applications in animal and human biology 
agriculture 
our nuclear transfer technology can be used for applications in agriculture that could improve livestock by producing unlimited numbers of genetically identical animals with superior commercial qualities 
such applications can be extended to major agricultural sectors  such as beef  dairy  pork and poultry  to provide large numbers of animals with superior characteristics of disease resistance  longevity  growth rate or product quality 
in  the fda announced its intention to allow milk and meat from cloned animals into the us food supply 
the proposed new regulations are now open for public comment 
transgenic animals 
our nuclear transfer technology can be applied to clone animals that have been genetically engineered to produce proteins for human therapeutic or industrial use 
for example  herds which carry the genes to make human antibodies could be cloned  thereby allowing for the large scale production of therapeutic antibodies or vaccines 
xenotransplantation 
our nuclear transfer technology can be used for applications in xenotransplantation to create animals whose cells  tissues or organs could be used in human organ transplantation settings 
this approach could be used either as a bridge to human organ transplantation or as a long term therapy 
in previous years  we granted a number of licenses to our nuclear transfer technology to companies who are utilizing it for applications in agriculture and production of biologicals 
in  following successes in three patent interference proceedings  we formed a joint venture company  start licensing  inc start  with exeter life sciences inc start is exclusively focused on managing and licensing intellectual property rights for animal cloning  including our nuclear transfer technology and rights conveyed to start by exeter life sciences 
we received an upfront license payment when start was created and own of start 
we will be entitled to a proportionate share of any revenues distributed by start 
we have retained all rights for use of the technology in human cells 
patents and proprietary technology a broad intellectual property portfolio of issued patents and pending patent applications supports our product development and out licensing activities 
we currently own or have licensed over issued or allowed united states patents  granted or accepted foreign patents and patent applications that are pending around the world 
our policy is to seek appropriate patent protection for inventions in our principal technology platforms telomerase  human embryonic stem cells and nuclear transfer as well as ancillary technologies that support these platforms or otherwise provide a competitive advantage to us 
we achieve this by filing patent applications for discoveries made by our scientists  as well as those that we make in conjunction with our scientific collaborators and strategic partners 
typically  although not always  we file patent applications in the united states and internationally through the patent cooperation treaty 
in addition  where appropriate  we try to obtain licenses from other organizations to patent filings that may be useful in advancing our scientific and product development programs 
our telomerase platform is the mainstay of our oncology program and it serves as the basis for other product opportunities 
our patent portfolio includes over issued or allowed united states patents  granted or accepted foreign patents and over patent applications pending worldwide relating to our telomerase product opportunities 
the foundational patents include those covering the cloned genes that encode the rna component htr and the catalytic protein component htert of human telomerase 
related issued and pending patents cover cells that are immortalized by expression of recombinant htert  cancer diagnostics based on detecting the expression of telomerase in cancer cells  the use of htert as a cancer vaccine  the use of the htert promoter to power cancer killing genes and viruses  and telomerase inhibitors for use as cancer therapeutics 
we own issued patents that cover the sequences of grn and grnl  as well as patents covering the chemistry that is used to build these oligonucleotides 
we have a license to the dendritic cell loading technology used in our telomerase cancer vaccine 
recently filed patent applications covering the telomerase activating compounds tat and tat that we discovered in collaboration with our colleagues at the hong kong university of science and technology have been exclusively licensed to our joint venture company  tat  for therapeutic applications 
our human embryonic stem cell platform is protected by patents rights that we either own or have licensed 
the patents that we have licensed include foundational hesc patents that arose from work that we funded at the university of wisconsin madison 
we have also filed patent applications to protect technologies developed by our scientists in our ongoing efforts to develop products based on hescs 
by way of example  these patent applications cover technologies that we believe will facilitate the commercial scale production of hescs  such as methods for growing the cells without the need for cell feeder layers 
patent applications that we own or have licensed also cover cell types that can be made from hescs  including hepatocytes liver cells  cardiomyocytes heart muscle cells  neural cells nerve cells  including dopaminergic neurons and oligodendrocytes  chondrocytes cartilage cells  pancreatic islet cells  osteoblasts bone cells  hematopoietic cells blood forming cells and dendritic cells 
currently our portfolio includes over patent applications pending around the world covering various aspects of our stem cell technology 
examples of granted stem cell patents that we own include  us patent nos 
 and  relating to hesc derived hepatocytes   relating to the feeder free growth of hescs  and  covering methods of producing neural cells from hescs 
our third technology platform  nuclear transfer  is protected in part by the patent rights that we purchased in with the acquisition of roslin bio med  which we now operate as geron bio med 
six united states patents have now issued  and foreign patents have been granted or accepted 
in addition  we have more than pending patent applications worldwide relating to nuclear transfer  arising both from the acquired patent rights and subsequent research that we funded at the roslin institute 
as discussed above  these patent rights are now a major asset of start licensing  inc  the joint venture company that we created in for the purpose of managing and licensing intellectual property rights for animal cloning 
we endeavor to monitor worldwide patent filings by third parties that are relevant to our business 
based on this monitoring  we may determine that an action is appropriate to protect our business interests 
such actions may include the filing of oppositions against the grant of a patent in overseas jurisdictions  and the filing of a request for the declaration of an interference with a us patent application or issued patent 
similarly  third parties may take similar actions against our patents 
by way of example  in we were involved in interference proceedings that we had initiated at the us patent and trademark office involving patents and patent applications for nuclear transfer technology  judgments in those actions were entered in our favor 
we are currently also involved in patent opposition proceedings before the european patent office  the australian patent office and the new zealand patent office  both as the party holding the opposed patent  and in opposition to patents granted or proposed to be granted to another entity 
government regulation regulation by governmental authorities in the united states and other countries is a significant factor in the development  manufacture and marketing of our proposed products and in our ongoing research and product development activities 
the nature and extent to which such regulation applies to us will vary depending on the nature of any products which may be developed by us 
we anticipate that many  if not all  of our proposed products will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization 
in particular  human therapeutic products are subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and other approval procedures of the fda and similar regulatory authorities in european and other countries 
various governmental statutes and regulations also govern or influence testing  manufacturing  safety  labeling  storage and recordkeeping related to such products and their marketing 
the process of obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and money  and there can be no guarantee that approvals will be granted 
fda approval process prior to commencement of clinical studies involving humans  preclinical testing of new pharmaceutical products is generally conducted on animals in the laboratory to evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of the product candidate 
the results of these studies are submitted to the fda as a part of an ind application  which must become effective before clinical testing in humans can begin 
typically  human clinical evaluation involves a time consuming and costly three phase process 
in phase i  clinical trials are conducted with a small number of people to assess safety and to evaluate the pattern of drug distribution and metabolism within the body 
in phase ii  clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy  optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety 
in some cases  an initial trial is conducted in diseased patients to assess both preliminary efficacy and preliminary safety and patterns of drug metabolism and distribution  in which case it is referred to as a phase i ii trial 
in phase iii  large scale  multi center  comparative trials are conducted with patients afflicted with a target disease in order to provide enough data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety required by the fda 
the fda closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical testing and may  at its discretion  re evaluate  alter  suspend  or terminate the testing based upon the data which have been accumulated to that point and its assessment of the risk benefit ratio to the patient 
monitoring of all aspects of the study to minimize risks is a continuing process 
all adverse events must be reported to the fda 
the results of the preclinical and clinical testing on non biologic drugs and certain diagnostic drugs are submitted to the fda in the form of a new drug application nda for approval prior to commencement of commercial sales 
in the case of vaccines or gene and cell therapies  the results of clinical trials are submitted as a biologics license application bla 
in responding to a nda or bla  the fda may grant marketing approval  request additional information or refuse to approve if the fda determines that the application does not satisfy its regulatory approval criteria 
there can be no assurance that approvals will be granted on a timely basis  if at all  for any of our proposed products 
european and other regulatory approval whether or not fda approval has been obtained  approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities in europe and other countries will likely be necessary prior to commencement of marketing the product in such countries 
the regulatory authorities in each country may impose their own requirements and may refuse to grant an approval  or may require additional data before granting it  even though the relevant product has been approved by the fda or another authority 
as with the fda  the regulatory authorities in the european union eu and other developed countries have lengthy approval processes for pharmaceutical products 
the process for gaining approval in particular countries varies  but generally follows a similar sequence to that described for fda approval 
in europe  the european committee for proprietary medicinal products provides a mechanism for eu member states to exchange information on all aspects of product licensing 
the eu has established a european agency for the evaluation of medical products  with both a centralized community procedure and a decentralized procedure  the latter being based on the principle of licensing within one member country followed by mutual recognition by the other member countries 
other regulations we are also subject to various united states federal  state  local and international laws  regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions  laboratory and manufacturing practices and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances  including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents  used in connection with our research work 
we cannot accurately predict the extent of government regulation which might result from future legislation or administrative action 
scientific consultants we have consulting agreements with a number of leading academic scientists and clinicians 
these individuals serve as key consultants or as members of clinical focus group panels with respect to our product development programs and strategies 
they are distinguished scientists and clinicians with expertise in numerous scientific fields  including embryonic stem cells  nuclear transfer and telomere and telomerase biology  as well as developmental biology  cellular biology and molecular biology 
we use consultants to provide us with expert advice and consultation on our scientific programs and strategies  as well as on the ethical aspects of our work 
they also serve as important contacts for us throughout the broader scientific community 
we retain each consultant according to the terms of a consulting agreement 
under such agreements  we pay them a consulting fee and reimburse them for out of pocket expenses incurred in performing their services for us 
in addition  some consultants hold options to purchase our common stock  subject to the vesting requirements contained in the consulting agreements 
our consultants are employed by institutions other than ours  and therefore may have commitments to  or consulting or advisory agreements with  other entities or academic institutions that may limit their availability to us

none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement  nor have we experienced work stoppages 
we consider relations with our employees to be good 
item a 
risk factors our business is subject to various risks  including those described below 
you should carefully consider these risk factors  together with all of the other information included in this annual report on form k 
any of these risks could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
our business is at an early stage of development 
our business is at an early stage of development  in that we do not yet have product candidates in late stage clinical trials or on the market 
one of our product candidates  a telomerase therapeutic cancer vaccine  has been studied in clinical trials conducted by an academic institution 
we have begun clinical testing of our lead anti cancer drug  grnl  in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and solid tumor malignancies 
we have no other product candidates in clinical testing 
our ability to develop product candidates that progress to and through clinical trials is subject to our ability to  among other things succeed in our research and development efforts  select therapeutic compounds or cell therapies for development  obtain required regulatory approvals  manufacture product candidates  and collaborate successfully with clinical trial sites  academic institutions  physician investigators  clinical research organizations and other third parties 
potential lead drug compounds or other product candidates and technologies will require significant preclinical and clinical testing prior to regulatory approval in the united states and other countries 
our product candidates may prove to have undesirable and unintended side effects or other characteristics adversely affecting their safety  efficacy or cost effectiveness that could prevent or limit their commercial use 
in addition  our product candidates may not prove to be more effective for treating disease or injury than current therapies 
accordingly  we may have to delay or abandon efforts to research  develop or obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates 
in addition  we will need to determine whether any of our potential products can be manufactured in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost 
our research and development efforts may not result in a product that can be approved by regulators or marketed successfully 
because of the significant scientific  regulatory and commercial milestones that must be reached for any of our development programs to be successful  any program may be abandoned  even after we have expended significant resources on the program  such as our investments in telomerase technology and human embryonic stem cells  which could cause a sharp drop in our stock price 
the science and technology of telomere biology and telomerase  human embryonic stem cells and nuclear transfer are relatively new 
there is no precedent for the successful commercialization of therapeutic product candidates based on our technologies 
these development programs are therefore particularly risky 
in addition  we  our licensees or our collaborators must undertake significant research and development activities to develop product candidates based on our technologies  which will require additional funding and may take years to accomplish  if ever 
we have a history of losses and anticipate future losses  and continued losses could impair our ability to sustain operations 
we have incurred operating losses every year since our operations began in as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with our research and development activities and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations 
we expect to incur additional operating losses and  as our development efforts and clinical testing activities continue  our operating losses may increase in size 
substantially all of our revenues to date have been research support payments under collaboration agreements and revenues from our licensing arrangements 
we may be unsuccessful in entering into any new corporate collaboration or license agreement that results in revenues 
we do not expect that the revenues generated from these arrangements will be sufficient alone to continue or expand our research or development activities and otherwise sustain our operations 
while we receive royalty revenue from licenses of diagnostic product candidates  telomerase immortalized cell lines and other licensing activities  we do not currently expect to receive sufficient royalty revenues from these licenses to sustain our operations 
our ability to continue or expand our research and development activities and otherwise sustain our operations is dependent on our ability  alone or with others  to  among other things  manufacture and market therapeutic products 
we also expect to experience negative cash flow for the foreseeable future as we fund our operating losses and capital expenditures 
this will result in decreases in our working capital  total assets and stockholders equity  which may not be offset by future financings 
we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability 
we may not be able to generate these revenues  and we may never achieve profitability 
our failure to achieve profitability could negatively impact the market price of our common stock 
even if we do become profitable  we cannot assure you that we would be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
we will need additional capital to conduct our operations and develop our products  and our ability to obtain the necessary funding is uncertain 
we will require substantial capital resources in order to conduct our operations and develop our product candidates  and we cannot assure you that our existing capital resources  interest income and equipment financing arrangements will be sufficient to fund our current and planned operations 
the timing and degree of any future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the accuracy of the assumptions underlying our estimates for our capital needs in and beyond  the magnitude and scope of our research and development programs  the progress we make in our research and development programs and in preclinical development and clinical trials  our ability to establish  enforce and maintain strategic arrangements for research  development  clinical testing  manufacturing and marketing  the number and type of product candidates that we pursue  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  and the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims 
we do not have any committed sources of capital 
additional financing through strategic collaborations  public or private equity financings  capital lease transactions or other financing sources may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
the receptivity of the public and private equity markets to proposed financings is substantially affected by the general economic  market and political climate and by other factors which are unpredictable and over which we have no control 
additional equity financings  if we obtain them  could result in significant dilution to stockholders 
further  in the event that additional funds are obtained through arrangements with collaborative partners  these arrangements may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies  product candidates or proposed products that we would otherwise seek to develop and commercialize ourselves 
if sufficient capital is not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our programs  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we do not have experience as a company conducting large scale clinical trials  or in other areas required for the successful commercialization and marketing of our product candidates 
we will need to receive regulatory approval for any product candidates before they may be marketed and distributed 
such approval will require  among other things  completing carefully controlled and well designed clinical trials demonstrating the safety and efficacy of each product candidate 
this process is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
we have no experience as a company in conducting large scale  late stage clinical trials  and our experience with early stage clinical trials with small numbers of patients is limited 
such trials would require either additional financial and management resources  or reliance on third party clinical investigators  clinical research organizations cros or consultants 
relying on third party clinical investigators or cros may force us to encounter delays that are outside of our control 
we also do not currently have marketing and distribution capabilities for our product candidates 
developing an internal sales and distribution capability would be an expensive and time consuming process 
we may enter into agreements with third parties that would be responsible for marketing and distribution 
however  these third parties may not be capable of successfully selling any of our product candidates 
because we or our collaborators must obtain regulatory approval to market our products in the united states and other countries  we cannot predict whether or when we will be permitted to commercialize our products 
federal  state and local governments in the united states and governments in other countries have significant regulations in place that govern many of our activities and may prevent us from creating commercially viable products from our discoveries 
the regulatory process  particularly for biopharmaceutical product candidates like ours  is uncertain  can take many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any product candidate that we or our collaborators develop must receive all relevant regulatory agency approvals before it may be marketed in the united states or other countries 
biological drugs and non biological drugs are rigorously regulated 
in particular  human pharmaceutical therapeutic product candidates are subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and other requirements by the food and drug administration fda in the united states and similar health authorities in other countries in order to demonstrate safety and efficacy 
because certain of our product candidates involve the application of new technologies or are based upon a new therapeutic approach  they may be subject to substantial additional review by various government regulatory authorities  and  as a result  the process of obtaining regulatory approvals for them may proceed more slowly than for product candidates based upon more conventional technologies 
we may never obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates 
data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities is susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory agency approvals 
in addition  delays or rejections may be encountered as a result of changes in regulatory agency policy during the period of product development and or the period of review of any application for regulatory agency approval for a product candidate 
delays in obtaining regulatory agency approvals could significantly harm the marketing of any products that we or our collaborators develop  impose costly procedures upon our activities or the activities of our collaborators  diminish any competitive advantages that we or our collaborators may attain  or adversely affect our ability to receive royalties and generate revenues and profits 
even if we commit the necessary time and resources  the required regulatory agency approvals may not be obtained for any product candidates developed by us or in collaboration with us 
if we obtain regulatory agency approval for a new product  this approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which it can be marketed that could limit the potential commercial use of the product 
approved products and their manufacturers are subject to continual review  and discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or its manufacturer may result in restrictions on the product or manufacturer  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
the sale by us or our collaborators of any commercially viable product will be subject to government regulation from several standpoints  including the processes of manufacturing  advertising and promoting  selling and marketing  labeling  and distribution 
if  and to the extent that  we are unable to comply with these regulations  our ability to earn revenues will be materially and negatively impacted 
failure to comply with regulatory requirements can result in severe civil and criminal penalties  including but not limited to recall or seizure of products  injunction against manufacture  distribution  sales and marketing  and criminal prosecution 
the imposition of any of these penalties could significantly impair our business  financial condition and results of operations 
entry into clinical trials with one or more product candidates may not result in any commercially viable products 
we may never generate revenues from product sales because of a variety of risks inherent in our business  including the following risks clinical trials may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates  completion of clinical trials may be delayed  or costs of clinical trials may exceed anticipated amounts  we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates  or may experience delays in obtaining such approvals  we may not be able to manufacture our product candidates economically on a commercial scale  we and any licensees of ours may not be able to successfully market our products  physicians may not prescribe our products  or patients or third party payors may not accept such products  others may have proprietary rights which prevent us from marketing our products  and competitors may sell similar  superior or lower cost products 
with respect to our telomerase cancer vaccine product candidate  clinical testing has been limited to early stage testing for a small number of patients 
the results of this testing may not be indicative of successful outcomes in later stage trials 
we have begun clinical testing for our phase i ii clinical trial of our telomerase inhibitor compound  grnl 
this is the first clinical trial for this product 
we have not commenced clinical testing for any other product candidate 
restrictions on the use of human embryonic stem cells  political commentary and the ethical and social implications of research involving human embryonic stem cells could prevent us from developing or gaining acceptance for commercially viable products based upon such stem cells and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
some of our most important programs involve the use of stem cells that are derived from human embryos 
the use of human embryonic stem cells gives rise to ethical and social issues regarding the appropriate use of these cells 
our research related to human embryonic stem cells may become the subject of adverse commentary or publicity  which could significantly harm the market price for our common stock 
some political and religious groups have voiced opposition to our technology and practices 
we use stem cells derived from human embryos that have been created for in vitro fertilization procedures but are no longer desired or suitable for that use and are donated with appropriate informed consent for research use 
many research institutions  including some of our scientific collaborators  have adopted policies regarding the ethical use of human embryonic tissue 
these policies may have the effect of limiting the scope of research conducted using human embryonic stem cells  thereby impairing our ability to conduct research in this field 
in addition  the united states government and its agencies have until recently refused to fund research which involves the use of human embryonic tissue 
president bush announced on august  that he would permit federal funding of research on human embryonic stem cells using the limited number of embryonic stem cell lines that had already been created  but relatively few federal grants have been made so far 
the president s council on bioethics will monitor stem cell research  and the guidelines and regulations it recommends may include restrictions on the scope of research using human embryonic or fetal tissue 
certain states are considering  or have in place  legislation relating to stem cell research  including california whose voters approved proposition to provide state funds for stem cell research in november it is not yet clear what  if any  affect such state actions may have on our ability to commercialize stem cell products 
in the united kingdom and other countries  the use of embryonic or fetal tissue in research including the derivation of human embryonic stem cells is regulated by the government  whether or not the research involves government funding 
government imposed restrictions with respect to use of embryos or human embryonic stem cells in research and development could have a material adverse effect on us  including harming our ability to establish critical partnerships and collaborations  delaying or preventing progress in our research and development  and causing a decrease in the price of our stock 
impairment of our intellectual property rights may adversely affect the value of our technologies and product candidates and limit our ability to pursue their development 
protection of our proprietary technology is critically important to our business 
our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and enforce our patents and maintain trade secrets  both in the united states and in other countries 
in the event that we are unsuccessful in obtaining and enforcing patents  our business would be negatively impacted 
further  our patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  and our patent rights may not provide proprietary protection or competitive advantages to us 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies  including ours  are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and technical questions 
in particular  legal principles for biotechnology patents in the united states and in other countries are evolving  and the extent to which we will be able to obtain patent coverage to protect our technology  or enforce issued patents  is uncertain 
for example  the european patent convention prohibits the granting of european patents for inventions that concern uses of human embryos for industrial or commercial purposes 
the european patent office is presently interpreting this prohibition broadly  and is applying it to reject patent claims that pertain to human embryonic stem cells 
however  this broad interpretation is being challenged through the european patent office appeals system 
as a result  we do not yet know whether or to what extent we will be able to obtain european patent protection for our human embryonic stem cell technologies in europe 
publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by at least several months and sometimes several years 
therefore  the persons or entities that we or our licensors name as inventors in our patents and patent applications may not have been the first to invent the inventions disclosed in the patent applications or patents  or the first to file patent applications for these inventions 
as a result  we may not be able to obtain patents for discoveries that we otherwise would consider patentable and that we consider to be extremely significant to our future success 
where several parties seek us patent protection for the same technology  the us patent and trademark office the patent office may declare an interference proceeding in order to ascertain the party to which the patent should be issued 
patent interferences are typically complex  highly contested legal proceedings  subject to appeal 
they are usually expensive and prolonged  and can cause significant delay in the issuance of patents 
moreover  parties that receive an adverse decision in an interference can lose important patent rights 
our pending patent applications  or our issued patents  may be drawn into interference proceedings which may delay or prevent the issuance of patents  or result in the loss of issued patent rights 
if more groups become engaged in scientific research related to telomerase biology and or embryonic stem cells  the number of patent filings by such groups and therefore the risk of our patents or applications being drawn into interferences may increase 
the interference process can also be used to challenge a patent that has been issued to another party 
for example  in we were party to two interferences declared by the patent office at our request 
these interferences involved two of our pending applications relating to nuclear transfer technology and two issued patents  held by the university of massachusetts u 
mass and licensed to advanced cell technology  inc act of worcester  massachusetts 
we requested these interferences in order to clarify our patent rights to this technology and to facilitate licensing to companies wishing to utilize this technology in animal cloning 
the board of patent appeals and interferences issued final judgments in each of these cases  finding in both instances that all of the claims in the u 
mass patents in question were unpatentable  and upholding the patentability of geron s pending claims 
these judgments were appealed by u 
mass and act  but the appeals have now been dismissed as part of a settlement agreement  resulting in invalidation of the u 
mass patents 
outside of the united states  certain jurisdictions  such as europe  new zealand and australia  permit oppositions to be filed against the granting of patents 
because our intent is to commercialize products internationally  securing both proprietary protection and freedom to operate outside of the united states is important to our business 
we are involved in both opposing the grant of patents to others through such opposition proceedings and in defending our patent applications against oppositions filed by others 
for example  we are involved in two patent oppositions before the european patent office epo with a danish company  pharmexa 
pharmexa which acquired the norwegian company gemvax in is developing a cancer vaccine that employs a short telomerase peptide to induce an immune response against telomerase and has announced plans to begin phase iii clinical trials 
pharmexa obtained a european patent with claims to the use of telomerase peptides for the treatment of cancer  and geron opposed that patent in in  the opposition division od of the epo revoked the claims originally granted to pharmexa  but permitted pharmexa to add new  narrower claims 
pharmexa has appealed that decision to the technical board of appeal tba  seeking restoration of the original claims  while geron has cross appealed  seeking revocation of all the claims 
in parallel  pharmexa opposed a european patent held by geron  the claims of which cover many facets of human telomerase  including the use of telomerase peptides in cancer vaccines 
in june  the od of the epo revoked three of the granted claims in geron s patent  specifically the three claims covering telomerase peptide cancer vaccines 
geron will appeal that decision to the tba 
we are also seeking to obtain patent coverage for telomerase peptides through a european divisional patent application 
the appeals in each of these european opposition cases will likely take a minimum of months and possibly considerably longer 
these oppositions reflect the complexity of the patent landscape in which we operate  and illustrate the risks and uncertainties 
we are also involved in other patent oppositions in europe  australia and new zealand 
patent opposition proceedings are not currently available in the us patent system  but legislation is pending to introduce them 
however  issued us patents can be reexamined by the patent office at the request of a third party 
patents owned or licensed by geron may therefore be subject to reexamination 
as in any legal proceeding  the outcome of patent reexaminations is uncertain  and a decision adverse to our interests could result in the loss of valuable patent rights 
in july  requests were filed on behalf of the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights for reexamination of three issued us patents owned by the wisconsin alumni research foundation warf and relating to human embryonic stem cells 
these three patents us patent nos 
  and  are licensed to geron pursuant to a january license agreement with warf 
in october  the patent office initiated the reexamination proceedings  such proceedings typically take one to two years to be concluded at the patent office  and the result may be subject to appeal 
successful challenges to our patents through interferences  oppositions or reexamination proceedings could result in a loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction s 
if we are unsuccessful in actions we bring against the patents of other parties  we may be subject to litigation  or otherwise prevented from commercializing potential products in the relevant jurisdiction  or may be required to obtain licenses to those patents or develop or obtain alternative technologies  any of which could harm our business 
as more groups become engaged in scientific research and product development in the areas of telomerase biology and or embryonic stem cells  the risk of our patents being challenged through patent interferences  oppositions  reexaminations or other means will likely increase 
furthermore  if such challenges to our patent rights are not resolved promptly in our favor  our existing business relationships may be jeopardized and we could be delayed or prevented from entering into new collaborations or from commercializing certain products  which could materially harm our business 
patent litigation may also be necessary to enforce patents issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of others 
we may not be successful in any patent litigation 
patent litigation can be extremely expensive and time consuming  even if the outcome is favorable to us 
an adverse outcome in a patent litigation  patent opposition  patent interference  or any other proceeding in a court or patent office could subject our business to significant liabilities to other parties  require disputed rights to be licensed from other parties or require us to cease using the disputed technology  any of which could severely harm our business 
if we fail to meet our obligations under license agreements  we may lose our rights to key technologies on which our business depends 
our business depends on several critical technologies that are based in part on patents licensed from third parties 
those third party license agreements impose obligations on us  such as payment obligations and obligations to diligently pursue development of commercial products under the licensed patents 
if a licensor believes that we have failed to meet our obligations under a license agreement  the licensor could seek to limit or terminate our license rights  which could lead to costly and time consuming litigation and  potentially  a loss of the licensed rights 
during the period of any such litigation our ability to carry out the development and commercialization of potential products could be significantly and negatively affected 
if our license rights were restricted or ultimately lost  our ability to continue our business based on the affected technology platform would be severely adversely affected 
we may be subject to litigation that will be costly to defend or pursue and uncertain in its outcome 
our business may bring us into conflict with our licensees  licensors  or others with whom we have contractual or other business relationships  or with our competitors or others whose interests differ from ours 
if we are unable to resolve those conflicts on terms that are satisfactory to all parties  we may become involved in litigation brought by or against us 
that litigation is likely to be expensive and may require a significant amount of management s time and attention  at the expense of other aspects of our business 
the outcome of litigation is always uncertain  and in some cases could include judgments against us that require us to pay damages  enjoin us from certain activities  or otherwise affect our legal or contractual rights  which could have a significant adverse effect on our business 
we may be subject to infringement claims that are costly to defend  and which may limit our ability to use disputed technologies and prevent us from pursuing research and development or commercialization of potential products 
our commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing patents and the proprietary rights of others 
our technologies may infringe the patents or proprietary rights of others 
in addition  we may become aware of discoveries and technology controlled by third parties that are advantageous to our programs 
in the event our technologies infringe the rights of others or we require the use of discoveries and technology controlled by third parties  we may be prevented from pursuing research  development or commercialization of potential products or may be required to obtain licenses to those patents or other proprietary rights or develop or obtain alternative technologies 
we have obtained licenses from several universities and companies for technologies that we anticipate incorporating into our potential products  and we initiate negotiation for licenses to other technologies as the need or opportunity arises 
we may not be able to obtain a license to patented technology on commercially favorable terms  or at all 
if we do not obtain a necessary license  we may need to redesign our technologies or obtain rights to alternate technologies  the research and adoption of which could cause delays in product development 
in cases where we are unable to license necessary technologies  we could be prevented from developing certain potential products 
our failure to obtain alternative technologies or a license to any technology that we may require to research  develop or commercialize our product candidates would significantly and negatively affect our business 
much of the information and know how that is critical to our business is not patentable and we may not be able to prevent others from obtaining this information and establishing competitive enterprises 
we sometimes rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary technology  especially in circumstances in which we believe patent protection is not appropriate or available 
we attempt to protect our proprietary technology in part by confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants  collaborators and contractors 
we cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached  that we would have adequate remedies for any breach  or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors  any of which would harm our business significantly 
we depend on our collaborators and joint venture partners to help us develop and test our product candidates  and our ability to develop and commercialize potential products may be impaired or delayed if collaborations are unsuccessful 
our strategy for the development  clinical testing and commercialization of our product candidates requires that we enter into collaborations with corporate or joint venture partners  licensors  licensees and others 
we are dependent upon the subsequent success of these other parties in performing their respective responsibilities and the continued cooperation of our partners 
by way of examples cell genesys is principally responsible for developing oncolytic virus therapeutics utilizing the telomerase promoter and roche is responsible for developing cancer diagnostics using our telomerase technology 
our collaborators may not cooperate with us or perform their obligations under our agreements with them 
we cannot control the amount and timing of our collaborators resources that will be devoted to activities related to our collaborative agreements with them 
our collaborators may choose to pursue existing or alternative technologies in preference to those being developed in collaboration with us 
under agreements with collaborators and joint venture partners  we may rely significantly on these parties to  among other activities conduct research and development activities in conjunction with us  design and conduct advanced clinical trials in the event that we reach clinical trials  fund research and development activities with us  manage and license certain patent rights  pay us fees upon the achievement of milestones  and market with us any commercial products that result from our collaborations or joint ventures 
the development and commercialization of potential products will be delayed if collaborators or joint venture partners fail to conduct these activities in a timely manner or at all 
for example in  we terminated our license to dendreon corporation because of its failure to meet diligence requirements in our agreement 
in addition  our collaborators could terminate their agreements with us and we may not receive any development or milestone payments 
if we do not achieve milestones set forth in the agreements  or if our collaborators breach or terminate their collaborative agreements with us  our business may be materially harmed 
our reliance on the activities of our non employee consultants  research institutions  and scientific contractors  whose activities are not wholly within our control  may lead to delays in development of our product candidates 
we rely extensively upon and have relationships with scientific consultants at academic and other institutions  some of whom conduct research at our request  and other consultants with expertise in clinical development strategy or other matters 
these consultants are not our employees and may have commitments to  or consulting or advisory contracts with  other entities that may limit their availability to us 
we have limited control over the activities of these consultants and  except as otherwise required by our collaboration and consulting agreements  can expect only limited amounts of their time to be dedicated to our activities 
in addition  we have formed research collaborations with many academic and other research institutions throughout the world 
these research facilities may have commitments to other commercial and non commercial entities 
we have limited control over the operations of these laboratories and can expect only limited amounts of their time to be dedicated to our research goals 
we also rely on other companies for certain process development  manufacturing or other technical scientific work  especially with respect to our grnl  grnvac and grnopc programs 
we have contracts with these companies that specify the work to be done and results to be achieved  but we do not have direct control over their personnel or operations 
if any of these third parties are unable or refuse to contribute to projects on which we need their help  our ability to generate advances in our technologies and develop our product candidates could be significantly harmed 
the loss of key personnel could slow our ability to conduct research and develop product candidates 
our future success depends to a significant extent on the skills  experience and efforts of our executive officers and key members of our scientific staff 
competition for personnel is intense and we may be unable to retain our current personnel or attract or assimilate other highly qualified management and scientific personnel in the future 
the loss of any or all of these individuals could harm our business and might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of research  development or business objectives 
we also rely on consultants and advisors who assist us in formulating our research and development and clinical strategy 
we face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous pharmaceutical  biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  as well as academic and other research institutions 
we may not be able to attract and retain these individuals on acceptable terms 
failure to do so could materially harm our business 
failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act requires that we establish and maintain an adequate internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting and include a report of management on our internal control over financial reporting 
our annual report on form k must contain an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that we have identified 
in addition  our independent registered public accounting firm must attest to and report on management s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
we have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which pertains to controls relating to the process of accounting for complex non routine transactions 
see item a controls and procedures management s report on internal control over financial reporting 
as of the date of this annual report on form k  we are in the process of implementing remedial measures related to the material weakness identified 
the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act are ongoing and also apply to future years 
we expect that our internal control over financial reporting will continue to evolve as our business develops 
although we are committed to continue to improve our internal control processes and we will continue to diligently and vigorously review our internal control over financial reporting in order to ensure compliance with the section requirements  any control system  regardless of how well designed  operated and evaluated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that its objectives will be met 
therefore  we cannot be certain that in the future additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies will not exist or otherwise be discovered 
if our efforts to remediate the weakness identified are not successful or if other deficiencies occur  these weaknesses or deficiencies could result misstatements of our results of operations  additional restatements of our consolidated financial statements  a decline in our stock price  or other material effects on our business  reputation  results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
potential restrictions or a ban on nuclear transfer could prevent us from benefiting financially from our research in this area 
our nuclear transfer technology could theoretically be used to produce human embryos for the derivation of embryonic stem cells sometimes referred to as therapeutic cloning or cloned humans sometimes referred to as reproductive cloning 
the us congress has recently considered legislation that would ban human therapeutic cloning as well as reproductive cloning 
such a bill was passed by the house of representatives  although not by the senate 
the july report of the president s council on bioethics recommended a four year moratorium on therapeutic cloning 
if human therapeutic cloning is restricted or banned  we will not be able to benefit from the scientific knowledge that would be generated by research in that area 
further  if regulatory bodies were to restrict or ban the sale of food products from cloned animals  our financial participation in the businesses of our nuclear transfer licensees or the value of our ownership in our joint venture  start licensing  could be significantly harmed 
our products are likely to be expensive to manufacture  and they may not be profitable if we are unable to significantly reduce the costs to manufacture them 
our telomerase inhibitor compound  grnl  and our hesc based products are likely to be more expensive to manufacture than most other drugs currently on the market today 
oligonucleotides are relatively large molecules with complex chemistry  and the cost of manufacturing an oligonucleotide like grnl is greater than the cost of making most small molecule drugs 
our present manufacturing processes are conducted at a small scale and are at an early stage of development 
we hope to substantially reduce manufacturing costs through process improvements  as well as through scale increases 
if we are not able to do so  however  and  depending on the pricing of the potential product  the profit margin on the telomerase inhibitor may be significantly less than that of most drugs on the market today 
similarly  we currently make differentiated cells from hescs on a laboratory scale  at a high cost per unit measure 
the cell based therapies we are developing based on hescs will probably require large quantities of cells 
we continue to develop processes to scale up production of the cells in a cost effective way 
we may not be able to charge a high enough price for any cell therapy product we develop  even if it is safe and effective  to make a profit 
if we are unable to realize significant profits from our potential product candidates  our business would be materially harmed 
some of our competitors may develop technologies that are superior to or more cost effective than ours  which may impact the commercial viability of our technologies and which may significantly damage our ability to sustain operations 
the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive 
other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and research organizations currently engage in or have in the past engaged in efforts related to the biological mechanisms that are the focus of our programs in oncology and human embryonic stem cell therapies  including the study of telomeres  telomerase  human embryonic stem cells  and nuclear transfer 
in addition  other products and therapies that could compete directly with the product candidates that we are seeking to develop and market currently exist or are being developed by pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies and by academic and other research organizations 
many companies are developing alternative therapies to treat cancer and  in this regard  are competitors of ours 
according to public data from the fda and nih  there are more than approved anti cancer products on the market in the united states  and several thousand in clinical development 
many of the pharmaceutical companies developing and marketing these competing products including glaxosmithkline  bristol myers squibb company and novartis ag  among others have significantly greater financial resources and expertise than we do in research and development  manufacturing  preclinical and clinical testing  obtaining regulatory approvals  and marketing and distribution 
smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors  particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies 
academic institutions  government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also conduct research  seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research  clinical development and marketing of products similar to ours 
these companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our programs 
in addition to the above factors  we expect to face competition in the following areas product efficacy and safety  the timing and scope of regulatory consents  availability of resources  reimbursement coverage  price  and patent position  including potentially dominant patent positions of others 
as a result of the foregoing  our competitors may develop more effective or more affordable products  or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than we do 
most significantly  competitive products may render any product candidates that we develop obsolete  which would negatively impact our business and ability to sustain operations 
we may not be able to obtain or maintain sufficient insurance on commercially reasonable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities in order to protect ourselves against product liability claims 
our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the testing  manufacturing and marketing of human therapeutic and diagnostic products 
we may become subject to product liability claims if the use of our potential products is alleged to have injured subjects or patients 
this risk exists for product candidates tested in human clinical trials as well as potential products that are sold commercially 
we currently have limited clinical trial liability insurance and we may not be able to maintain this type of insurance for any of our clinical trials 
in addition  product liability insurance is becoming increasingly expensive 
as a result  we may not be able to obtain or maintain product liability insurance in the future on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
to be successful  our product candidates must be accepted by the health care community  which can be very slow to adopt or unreceptive to new technologies and products 
our product candidates and those developed by our collaborative or joint venture partners  if approved for marketing  may not achieve market acceptance since hospitals  physicians  patients or the medical community in general may decide not to accept and utilize these products 
the product candidates that we are attempting to develop represent substantial departures from established treatment methods and will compete with a number of conventional drugs and therapies manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical companies 
the degree of market acceptance of any of our developed potential products will depend on a number of factors  including our establishment and demonstration to the medical community of the clinical efficacy and safety of our product candidates  our ability to create products that are superior to alternatives currently on the market  our ability to establish in the medical community the potential advantage of our treatments over alternative treatment methods  and reimbursement policies of government and third party payors 
if the health care community does not accept our potential products for any of the foregoing reasons  or for any other reason  our business would be materially harmed 
if we fail to obtain acceptable prices or adequate reimbursement for our product candidates  the use of our potential products could be severely limited 
our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates will depend significantly on our ability to obtain acceptable prices and the availability of reimbursement to the patient from third party payors 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products  including pharmaceuticals 
if our potential products are not considered cost effective or if we fail to generate adequate third party reimbursement for the users of our potential products and treatments  then we may be unable to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development 
in both us and other markets  sales of our potential products  if any  will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third party payors  examples of which include government health administration authorities  private health insurers  health maintenance organizations  and pharmacy benefit management companies 
both federal and state governments in the united states and governments in other countries continue to propose and pass legislation designed to contain or reduce the cost of health care 
legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals and other medical products may be adopted before any of our potential products are approved for marketing 
cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we receive for any product candidate we may develop in the future 
in addition  third party payors are increasingly challenging the price and cost effectiveness of medical products and services and any of our potential products may ultimately not be considered cost effective by these third parties 
any of these initiatives or developments could materially harm our business 
our activities involve hazardous materials  and improper handling of these materials by our employees or agents could expose us to significant legal and financial penalties 
our research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  chemicals and various radioactive compounds 
as a consequence  we are subject to numerous environmental and safety laws and regulations  including those governing laboratory procedures  exposure to blood borne pathogens and the handling of biohazardous materials 
we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with current or future environmental laws and regulations and may be adversely affected by the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations 
although we believe that our safety procedures for using  handling  storing and disposing of hazardous materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated 
in the event of such an accident  state or federal authorities could curtail our use of these materials and we could be liable for any civil damages that result  the cost of which could be substantial 
further  any failure by us to control the use  disposal  removal or storage  or to adequately restrict the discharge  or assist in the cleanup  of hazardous chemicals or hazardous  infectious or toxic substances could subject us to significant liabilities  including joint and several liability under certain statutes 
any such liability could exceed our resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  an accident could damage our research and manufacturing facilities and operations 
additional federal  state and local laws and regulations affecting us may be adopted in the future 
we may incur substantial costs to comply with these laws and regulations and substantial fines or penalties if we violate any of these laws or regulations 
our stock price has historically been very volatile 
stock prices and trading volumes for many biopharmaceutical companies fluctuate widely for a number of reasons  including factors which may be unrelated to their businesses or results of operations such as media coverage  legislative and regulatory measures and the activities of various interest groups or organizations 
this market volatility  as well as general domestic or international economic  market and political conditions  could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the return on your investment 
historically  our stock price has been extremely volatile 
between january and december  our stock has traded as high as per share and as low as per share 
between january  and december   the price has ranged between a high of per share and a low of per share 
the significant market price fluctuations of our common stock are due to a variety of factors  including the demand in the market for our common stock  the experimental nature of our product candidates  fluctuations in our operating results  market conditions relating to the biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical industries  announcements of technological innovations  new commercial products  or clinical progress or lack thereof by us  our collaborative partners or our competitors  announcements concerning regulatory developments  developments with respect to proprietary rights and our collaborations  comments by securities analysts  general market conditions  political developments related to human embryonic stem cell research  public concern with respect to our product candidates  or the issuance of common stock to partners  vendors or to investors to raise additional capital 
in addition  the stock market is subject to other factors outside our control that can cause extreme price and volume fluctuations 
securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies  including many biotechnology companies  which experience volatility in the market price of their securities 
litigation brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could adversely affect our business 
the sale of a substantial number of shares may adversely affect the market price for our common stock 
sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that such sales could occur  could significantly and negatively affect the market price for our common stock 
as of december   we had  shares of common stock authorized for issuance and  shares of common stock outstanding 
in addition  as of december   we have reserved for future issuance approximately  shares of common stock for our stock plans  potential milestone payments and outstanding warrants 
in addition  we have issued common stock to certain parties  such as vendors and service providers  as payment for products and services 
under these arrangements  we typically agree to register the shares for resale soon after their issuance 
we may continue to pay for certain goods and services in this manner  which would dilute your interest in us 
also  sales of the shares issued in this manner could negatively affect the market price of our stock 
our undesignated preferred stock may inhibit potential acquisition bids  this may adversely affect the market price for our common stock and the voting rights of holders of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation provides our board of directors with the authority to issue up to  shares of undesignated preferred stock and to determine the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of these shares without further vote or action by our stockholders 
as of the date of this filing   shares of preferred stock have been designated series a junior participating preferred stock and the board of directors still has authority to designate and issue up to  shares of preferred stock 
the issuance of shares of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control transaction without further action by our stockholders 
as a result  the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected 
in addition  if we issue preferred stock in the future that has preference over our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon our liquidation  dissolution or winding up  or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock  the rights of holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected 
provisions in our share purchase rights plan  charter and bylaws  and provisions of delaware law  may inhibit potential acquisition bids for us  which may prevent holders of our common stock from benefiting from what they believe may be the positive aspects of acquisitions and takeovers 
our board of directors has adopted a share purchase rights plan  commonly referred to as a poison pill 
this plan entitles existing stockholders to rights  including the right to purchase shares of common stock  in the event of an acquisition of or more of our outstanding common stock 
our share purchase rights plan could prevent stockholders from profiting from an increase in the market value of their shares as a result of a change of control of us by delaying or preventing a change of control 
in addition  our board of directors has the authority  without further action by our stockholders  to issue additional shares of common stock  and to fix the rights and preferences of one or more series of preferred stock 
in addition to our share purchase rights plan and the undesignated preferred stock  provisions of our charter documents and bylaws may make it substantially more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us and may prevent changes in our management  including provisions that prevent stockholders from taking actions by written consent  divide the board of directors into separate classes with terms of office that are structured to prevent all of the directors from being elected in any one year  and set forth procedures for nominating directors and submitting proposals for consideration at stockholders meetings 
provisions of delaware law may also inhibit potential acquisition bids for us or prevent us from engaging in business combinations 
in addition  we have severance agreements with several employees and a change of control severance plan which could require an acquiror to pay a higher price 
either collectively or individually  these provisions may prevent holders of our common stock from benefiting from what they may believe are the positive aspects of acquisitions and takeovers  including the potential realization of a higher rate of return on their investment from these types of transactions 
we do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
any payment of cash dividends will depend upon our financial condition  results of operations  capital requirements and other factors and will be at the discretion of the board of directors 
furthermore  we may incur additional indebtedness that may severely restrict or prohibit the payment of dividends
