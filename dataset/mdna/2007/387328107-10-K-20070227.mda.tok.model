item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
design build is increasingly being used as a method of project delivery 
unlike traditional projects where owners first hire a design firm or design a project themselves and then put the project out to bid for construction  design build projects provide the owner with a single point of responsibility and a single contact for both design and construction 
hcd s revenue from design build projects has grown over the last several years and represented of hcd revenue of total company revenue in and of hcd revenue of total company revenue in although these projects carry additional risk as compared to traditional bid build projects  the profit potential can also be higher 
we frequently bid design build projects as a part of a joint venture team 
business strategy our fundamental objective is to increase long term shareholder value by focusing on consistent profitability from controlled revenue growth 
shareholder value is measured by the appreciation of the value of our common stock over a period of years as well as a return from dividends 
further  it is a specific measure of our financial success to achieve a return on net assets greater than the cost of capital  creating granite value added 
we believe that the following are key factors in our ability to achieve this objective employee development we believe that our employees are key to the successful implementation of our business strategies 
significant resources are employed to attract  nurture and retain extraordinary talent and fully develop each employee s capabilities 
infrastructure construction focus we concentrate our core competencies on this segment of the construction industry  which includes the building of roads  highways  bridges  dams and tunnels  mass transit facilities  railroad infrastructure and underground utilities as well as site preparation 
this focus allows us to most effectively utilize our specialized strengths  which include grading  paving and concrete structures 
ownership of aggregate materials and construction equipment we own and lease aggregate reserves and own processing plants that are vertically integrated into our construction operations and we own a large fleet of carefully maintained heavy construction equipment 
by ensuring availability of these resources at favorable cost  we believe we have bidding advantages in many of our markets  as well as a reliable source of revenue and income from the sale of construction materials to unaffiliated parties 
selective bidding we focus our resources to bid on jobs that meet our selective bidding criteria  which include analyzing the risk of a potential job in relation to available personnel to estimate and prepare the proposal  degree of competition  experience with the type of work  relationship with the owner  local resources and partnerships  equipment resources  and size and complexity of the job 
diversification to mitigate the risks inherent in construction and general economic factors  we pursue projects i in both the public and private sectors  ii for a wide range of customers within each sector from the federal government to small municipalities and from large corporations to individual homeowners  iii in diverse geographic markets  iv that are design build  lump sum and fixed unit price  and v of various sizes  durations and complexities 

table of contents decentralized profit centers we approach each selected market with a local focus through our decentralized structure 
each of our branches and hcd regional offices are individual profit centers 
profit based incentives we compensate our profit center managers with base salaries below the median point of salaries for similar positions in the marketplace coupled with a substantial variable cash and restricted stock incentive element based on the annual profit performance of their respective profit centers 
controlled expansion we intend to continue our expansion by selectively adding branches or branch satellite locations in the western united states  exploring opportunities to establish branch like businesses in other areas of the country through acquisitions  and selectively pursuing major infrastructure projects throughout the nation where we have an established presence 
additionally  we intend to leverage our financial capacity by investing in a limited number of real estate development projects that we believe will provide an acceptable return on our investment 
accident prevention we believe that the prevention of accidents is both a moral obligation and good business 
by identifying and concentrating resources to address jobsite hazards  we continually strive to reduce our incident rates and the costs associated with accidents 
environmental responsibility we believe it benefits everyone to maintain environmentally responsible operations 
we are committed to effective measures to protect the environment and maintain good community relations 
we continually monitor our performance in this area and take our responsibilities to the communities we work in and compliance with government agency requirements seriously 
quality and high ethical standards we emphasize the importance of performing high quality work and maintaining high ethical standards through an established code of conduct and an effective corporate compliance program 
customers we have customers in both the public and private sectors 
the branch division s largest volume customer is the california department of transportation caltrans 
in  contracts with caltrans represented of our revenue  and total public sector revenue generated in california represented of our revenue 
other branch division customers include departments of transportation of other states  county and city public works departments  school districts and developers and owners of industrial  commercial and residential sites 
hcd s customers are predominantly in the public sector and currently include the state departments of transportation in a number of states as well as local transit authorities and federal agencies see concentrations in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
backlog our backlog includes the total value of awarded contracts that have not been completed  including our proportionate share of unconsolidated joint venture contracts 
our backlog was approximately billion at both december  and approximately billion of the december  backlog is expected to be completed during with the exception of certain federal government contracts  we include a construction project in our backlog at such time as a contract is awarded and funding is in place 
certain federal government contracts that extend beyond one year are funded on a year by year basis 
backlog at december  includes approximately million from one federal government project for which the funding has not yet been fully allocated 
substantially all of the contracts in our backlog may be canceled or modified at the election of the customer  however  we have not been materially adversely affected by contract cancellations or modifications in the past see contract provisions and subcontracting 
a sizeable percentage of our anticipated contract revenue in any year is not reflected in our backlog at the start of the year due to the short duration of smaller branch division projects that are initiated and completed during each year turn business 
backlog by segment is presented in backlog under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
equipment and plants we own many pieces of equipment  including cranes  bulldozers  barges  backhoes  excavators  scrapers  motor graders  loaders  trucks  pavers and rollers as well as construction materials processing plants 
in and  we spent approximately million and million  respectively  for construction equipment  plants and vehicles 
at december  and  we owned the following construction equipment  plants and vehicles 
table of contents december  heavy construction equipment units trucks  truck tractors and trailers and vehicles units aggregate crushing plants asphalt concrete plants portland cement concrete batch plants asphalt rubber plants lime slurry plants we believe that ownership of equipment is generally preferable to leasing because ownership ensures the equipment is available as needed and normally results in lower equipment costs 
we attempt to keep our equipment as fully utilized as possible by pooling equipment for use by both the branch division and hcd 
we regularly lease or rent equipment on a short term basis to supplement existing equipment and respond to construction activity peaks 
employees on december   we employed approximately  salaried employees  who work in management  estimating and clerical capacities  and  hourly employees 
the total number of hourly personnel employed by us is subject to the volume of construction in progress 
during  the number of hourly employees ranged from  to  and averaged approximately  our wholly owned subsidiaries  granite construction company and granite construction northeast  inc formerly granite halmar construction company  inc and our majority owned subsidiary  wilder construction company are parties to craft collective bargaining agreements in many areas in which they work 
we believe our employees are our most valuable resource and that our workforce possesses a strong dedication to and pride in our company 
among salaried and non union hourly employees  this dedication is reinforced by equity ownership through our employee stock ownership plan  our profit sharing and k plan and performance based incentive compensation arrangements at december  our managerial and supervisory personnel have an average of approximately years of service with us 
competition factors influencing our competitiveness include price  reputation for quality  the availability of aggregate materials  machinery and equipment  financial strength  knowledge of local markets and conditions  and project management and estimating abilities 
although some of our competitors are larger than us and may possess greater resources  we believe that we compete favorably on the basis of the foregoing factors 
historically  the construction business has not usually required large amounts of capital  particularly for the smaller size construction work pursued by our branch division  which can result in relative ease of market entry for companies possessing acceptable qualifications 
branch division competitors range from small local construction companies to large regional and national construction companies 
while the market areas of these competitors overlap with several of the markets served by our branches  few compete in all of our market areas 
in addition  most of our branches own and or have long term leases on aggregate resources that provide an extra measure of competitive advantage in certain markets 
hcd normally competes with large regional and national construction companies  which may or may not be larger than granite 
although the construction business is highly competitive  we believe we are well positioned to compete effectively in the markets in which we operate 
contract provisions and subcontracting our contracts with our customers are primarily either fixed unit price or fixed price 
under fixed unit price contracts  we are committed to provide materials or services required by a project at fixed unit prices for example  dollars per cubic yard of concrete poured or cubic yard of earth excavated 
while the fixed unit price contract shifts the risk of estimating the quantity of units required for a particular project to the customer  any increase in our unit cost over the expected unit cost in the bid  whether due to inflation  inefficiency  faulty estimates or other factors  is borne by us unless otherwise provided in the contract 
fixed price contracts are priced on a lump sum basis under which we bear the risk of performing all the work for the specified amount 
the percentage of fixed price contracts in our backlog increased from approximately at december  to approximately at december  our contracts are generally obtained through competitive bidding in response to advertisements by federal  state and local government agencies and private parties 
less frequently  contracts may be obtained through direct negotiations with private owners 
our contract risk mitigation process includes identifying risks and opportunities during the bidding process  review of bids fitting certain criteria by various levels of management and  in some cases  by the executive committee of our board of directors 

table of contents there are a number of factors that can create variability in contract performance and results as compared to a project s original bid 
the most significant of these include the completeness and accuracy of the original bid  costs associated with added scope changes  extended overhead due to owner and weather delays  subcontractor performance issues  changes in productivity expectations  site conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid to the extent contract remedies are unavailable  the availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of the project and a change in the availability and proximity of equipment and materials 
all of these factors can impose inefficiencies on contract performance  which can drive up costs and lower profits 
conversely  if any of these or other factors are more positive than the assumptions in our bid  project profitability can improve 
the ability to realize improvements on project profitability is more limited than the risk of lower profitability 
design build projects carry other risks such as the risk inherent in estimating quantities and prices before the project design is completed and design error risk  including additional construction costs due to any design errors  liability to the contract owner for the design of the project and right of way and permit acquisition costs 
although we manage this additional risk by adding contingencies to our bid amounts  obtaining errors and omissions insurance and obtaining indemnifications from our design consultants where possible  there is no guarantee that these risk management strategies will always be successful 
all state and federal government contracts and most of our other contracts provide for termination of the contract for the convenience of the contract owner  with provisions to pay us for work performed through the date of termination 
we have not been materially adversely affected by these provisions in the past 
many of our contracts contain provisions that require us to pay liquidated damages if specified completion schedule requirements are not met and these amounts can be significant 
we act as prime contractor on most of the construction projects we undertake 
we accomplish the majority of our projects with our own resources and subcontract specialized activities such as electrical and mechanical work 
as prime contractor  we are responsible for the performance of the entire contract  including subcontract work 
thus  we may be subject to increased costs associated with the failure of one or more subcontractors to perform as anticipated 
we manage this risk by reviewing the size of the subcontract  the financial stability of the subcontractor and other factors and  based on this review  determine whether to require that the subcontractor furnish a bond or other type of security that guarantees their performance 
disadvantaged business enterprise regulations require us to use our best efforts to subcontract a specified portion of contract work done for governmental agencies to certain types of disadvantaged subcontractors 
as with all of our subcontractors  some may not be able to obtain surety bonds or other types of performance security 
insurance and bonding we maintain general and excess liability  construction equipment and workers compensation insurance  all in amounts consistent with industry practices 
in connection with our business  we generally are required to provide various types of surety bonds that provide an additional measure of security for our performance under certain public and private sector contracts 
our ability to obtain surety bonds depends upon our capitalization  working capital  past performance  management expertise and external factors  including the capacity of the overall surety market 
surety companies consider such factors in light of the amount of our backlog that we have currently bonded and their current underwriting standards  which may change from time to time 
the capacity of the surety market is subject to market driven fluctuations driven primarily by the level of surety industry losses and the degree of surety market consolidation 
when the surety market capacity shrinks it results in higher premiums and increased difficulty obtaining bonding  in particular for larger  more complex projects throughout the market 
in order to help mitigate this risk  we employ a co surety structure involving three sureties 
our majority owned subsidiary  wilder construction company  continues to work with a single surety and obtains surety bonds on a stand alone basis 
although we do not believe that fluctuations in surety market capacity has significantly impacted our ability to grow our business  there is no assurance that it will not significantly impact our ability to obtain new contracts in the future see item a 
risk factors 

table of contents government and environmental regulations our operations are subject to compliance with regulatory requirements of federal  state and local government agencies and authorities  including regulations concerning workplace safety  labor relations and disadvantaged businesses 
additionally  all of our operations are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment  including those relating to discharges to air  water and land  the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste  the handling of underground storage tanks and the cleanup of properties affected by hazardous substances 
certain environmental laws impose substantial penalties for non compliance and others  such as the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  impose strict  retroactive  joint and several liability upon persons responsible for releases of hazardous substances 
we continually evaluate whether we must take additional steps at our locations to ensure compliance with environmental laws 
while compliance with applicable regulatory requirements has not materially adversely affected our operations in the past  there can be no assurance that these requirements will not change and that compliance will not adversely affect our operations in the future 
in addition  our aggregate materials operations require operating permits granted by governmental agencies 
we believe that tighter regulations for the protection of the environment and other factors will make it increasingly difficult to obtain new permits and renewal of existing permits may be subject to more restrictive conditions than currently exist 
the california air resources board has proposed regulations that will require equipment owners to reduce diesel particulate emissions from in use off road diesel equipment to meet emission targets proposed for each year from to a regulation is anticipated to be approved in the emission targets that are currently proposed will require california off road diesel equipment owners to retrofit equipment with diesel particulate filters or replace equipment with new engine technology as it becomes available 
this regulation is still in the rule making process and changes to the regulation may be made prior to its final approval 
as is the case with other companies in the same industry  some of our aggregate products contain varying amounts of crystalline silica  a common mineral 
also  some of our construction and material processing operations release as dust crystalline silica that is in the materials being handled 
excessive  prolonged inhalation of very small sized particles of crystalline silica has allegedly been associated with respiratory disease including silicosis 
the mine safety and health administration and the occupational safety and health administration have established occupational thresholds for crystalline silica exposure as respirable dust 
we monitor to verify that our dust control procedures are keeping occupational exposures at or below the requisite thresholds and to verify that respiratory protective equipment is made available when required 
we also communicate  through safety information sheets and other means  what we believe to be appropriate warnings and cautions to employees and customers about the risks associated with excessive  prolonged inhalation of mineral dust in general and crystalline silica in particular

item a 
risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in the report or otherwise adversely affect our business 
our success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel in a competitive environment 
the single largest factor in our ability to profitably execute our work is our ability to attract  develop and retain qualified personnel 
our success in attracting qualified people is dependent on the resources available in individual geographic areas and the impact on the labor supply due to general economic conditions as well as our ability to provide a competitive compensation package and work environment 
economic downturns and reductions in government funding could have a negative impact on our business 
significant portions of our revenues are derived from contracts that are funded by federal  state and local government agencies 
our ability to obtain future public sector work at reasonable margins is highly dependent on the amount of work that is available to bid  which is largely a function of the level of government funding available 
we also perform commercial and residential site development and other work for customers in the private sector 
the availability of this private sector work can be significantly adversely affected by general economic downturns 

table of contents our fixed price and fixed unit price contracts subject us to the risk of increased project cost 
as more fully described under contract provisions and subcontracting above  the profitability of our fixed price and fixed unit price contracts can be adversely affected by a number of factors that can cause our actual costs to materially exceed the costs estimated at the time of our original bid 
accounting for our revenues and costs involves significant estimates 
as further described in critical accounting estimates under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  accounting for our contract related revenues and costs  as well as other cost items  requires management to make a variety of significant estimates and assumptions 
although we believe we have sufficient experience and processes to enable us to formulate appropriate assumptions and produce reasonably dependable estimates  these assumptions and estimates may change significantly in the future  and these changes could result in the reversal of previously recognized revenue and profit and have a material adverse effect on our financial position and the results of our operations 
many of our contracts have penalties for late completion 
in some instances  including many of our fixed price contracts  we guarantee that we will complete a project by a scheduled date 
if we subsequently fail to complete the project as scheduled we may be held responsible for cost impacts resulting from any delay  generally in the form of contractually agreed upon liquidated damages 
to the extent that these events occur  the total costs of the project could exceed our original estimates and we could experience reduced profits or  in some cases  a loss for that project 
weather can significantly impact our quarterly revenues and profitability 
our ability to perform work is significantly impacted by weather conditions such as precipitation and temperature 
changes in weather conditions can create significant variability in our quarterly revenues and profitability  particularly in the first and fourth quarters of the year 
additionally  delays and other weather impacts may increase a project s cost and decrease its profitability 
we work in a highly competitive marketplace 
as more fully described under competition above  we have multiple competitors in all of the areas in which we work 
during economic down cycles or times of lower government funding for public works projects  competition for the fewer available projects intensifies and this increased competition may result in a decrease in our ability to be competitive at acceptable margins 
an inability to secure and permit aggregate reserves could negatively impact our future operations and results 
tighter regulations for the protection of the environment and the finite nature of property containing suitable aggregate reserves are making it increasingly challenging and costly to secure and permit aggregate reserves 
although we have thus far been able to secure and permit reserves to support our business  it is likely to become increasingly difficult to do so and there is no assurance that we will be able to secure and permit reserves in the future 
we are subject to environmental and other regulation 
as more fully described under government and environmental regulations above  we are subject to a number of federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment  workplace safety and a variety of socioeconomic requirements  the noncompliance of which can result in substantial penalties  termination or suspension of government contracts as well as civil and criminal liability 
while compliance with these laws and regulations has not materially adversely affected our operations in the past  there can be no assurance that these requirements will not change and that compliance will not adversely affect our operations in the future 
strikes or work stoppages could have a negative impact on our operations and results 
we are party to collective bargaining agreements covering a portion of our craft workforce 
although our results and operations have not been significantly impacted by strikes or work stoppages in the past  such labor actions could have a significant impact on our operations if they occur in the future 

table of contents unavailability of insurance coverage could have a negative impact on our operations and results 
we maintain insurance coverage as part of our overall risk management strategy and pursuant to requirements to maintain specific coverage that are contained in our financing agreements and in most of our construction contracts 
although we have been able to obtain insurance coverage to meet our requirements in the past  there is no assurance that such insurance coverage will be available in the future 
an inability to obtain bonding would have a negative impact on our operations and results 
as more fully described in insurance and bonding above  we generally are required to provide surety bonds securing our performance under the majority of our public and private sector contracts 
our inability to obtain surety bonds in the future would significantly impact our ability to obtain new contracts  which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
our joint venture contracts with project owners subject us to joint and several liability 
if a joint venture partner fails to perform we could be liable for completion of the entire contract and  if the contract were unprofitable  this could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we use certain commodity products that are subject to significant price fluctuations 
diesel fuel  liquid asphalt and other petroleum based products are used to fuel and lubricate our equipment and fire our asphalt concrete processing plants and also constitute a significant part of the asphalt paving materials that are used in many of our construction projects and sold to outside parties 
although we are partially protected by asphalt or fuel price escalation clauses in some of our contracts  many contracts provide no such protection 
we also use cement  steel and other commodities in our construction projects that can be subject to significant price fluctuations 
we have not been significantly adversely affected by price fluctuations in the past  however  there is no guarantee that we will not be in the future 
as a part of our growth strategy we expect to make future acquisitions and acquisitions involve many risks 
these risks include difficulties integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies  diversion of management s attention from our ongoing operations  potential difficulties and increased costs associated with completion of any assumed construction projects  insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions and the potential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired companies 
acquisitions may also cause us to increase our liabilities  record goodwill or other non amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to subsequent impairment testing and potential impairment charges and incur amortization expenses related to certain other intangible assets 
failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could harm our business and operating results significantly 
our goodwill may be impaired and result in a charge to income 
we have accounted for our past acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
under the purchase method  we recorded  at fair value  assets acquired and liabilities assumed  and we recorded as goodwill the difference between the cost of acquisitions and the sum of the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired  less liabilities assumed 
at december   our goodwill balance was million 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  our recorded goodwill is not amortized but instead is subject to an impairment review on at least an annual basis 
in the future  if our goodwill is determined to be impaired  the impairment would result in a charge to income from operations in the year of the impairment with a resulting decrease in our recorded net worth 
failure of our subcontractors to perform as anticipated could have a negative impact on our results 
as further described under contract provisions and subcontracting above  we subcontract a portion of many of our contracts to specialty subcontractors and we are ultimately responsible for the successful completion of their work 
although we seek to require bonding or other forms of guarantees  we are not always successful in obtaining those bonds or guarantees from our higher risk subcontractors  and there is no guarantee that we will not incur a material loss due to subcontractor performance issues 
we may be unable to identify qualified disadvantaged business enterprise dbe contractors to perform as subcontractors 
certain of our government agency projects contain minimum dbe participation clauses 
if we subsequently fail to complete these projects with the minimum dbe participation we may be held responsible for damages due to breach of contract including restrictions on our ability to bid on future projects and monetary damages 
to the extent that these events occur  the total costs of the project could exceed our original estimates and we could experience reduced profits or  in some cases  a loss for that project 

table of contents a significant portion of our revenue is from government funded contracts 
approximately of our consolidated revenue in was derived from performing contracts funded by federal  state and local government agencies and authorities 
these government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations  contract provisions and a variety of socioeconomic requirements relating to their formation  administration  performance and accounting 
many of these contracts include express or implied certifications of compliance with applicable laws and contract provisions 
as a result of our government contracting  claims for civil or criminal fraud may be brought by the government for violations of these regulations  requirements or statutes 
we may also be subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government under the federal civil false claims act  which could include claims for up to treble damages 
further  if we fail to comply with any of these regulations  requirements or statutes  our existing government contracts could be terminated  we could be suspended from government contracting or subcontracting  including federally funded projects at the state level 
if our government contracts are terminated for any reason  or if we are suspended from government work  we could suffer a significant reduction in expected revenue 
our long term debt and credit arrangements contain restrictive covenants and failure to meet these covenants could significantly harm our financial condition 
our long term debt and credit arrangements and related restrictive covenants are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
in most cases  failure to meet the restrictive covenants would result in an immediate repayment of all amounts due and cancellation of open lines of credit 
additionally  failure to meet restrictive covenants related to our debt and credit agreements would trigger cross default provisions that would cause us to also be in default of our surety agreements 
although we have not had difficulty meeting these covenants in the past  failure to do so in the future could have material adverse effects on our business and financial condition 
our backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and could be an uncertain indicator of our future earnings 
we cannot guarantee that the revenues projected in our backlog will be realized or  if realized  will result in profits 
projects may remain in our backlog for an extended period of time 
in addition  project cancellations or scope adjustments may occur  from time to time  with respect to contracts reflected in our backlog 
backlog reductions can adversely affect the revenue and profit we actually receive from contracts reflected in our backlog 
future project cancellations and scope adjustments could further reduce the dollar amount of our backlog and the revenues and profits that we actually receive 
the foregoing list is not exhaustive 
there can be no assurance that we have correctly identified and appropriately assessed all factors affecting our business or that the publicly available and other information with respect to these matters is complete and correct 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial also may adversely impact us 
these developments could have material adverse effects on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for these reasons  the reader is cautioned not to place undue reliance on our forward looking statements

table of contents item legal proceedings eldredge a million judgment was entered in june against our wholly owned subsidiary granite construction company gcco by the district court clark county  nevada  in an action entitled eldredge vs 
las vegas valley water district  gcco  et al 
the civil lawsuit was initially brought by a former employee of gcco against the las vegas water district in june the plaintiff subsequently filed an amended complaint on june   bringing gcco into the action and seeking compensation in addition to the worker s compensation payments the employee previously accepted for injuries sustained when a trench collapsed 
the jury issued a verdict finding against gcco on two causes of action  assault and battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress 
the judgment awarded damages for past and future lost wages  medical expenses and pain and suffering 
after the verdict was issued  the plaintiff filed a motion seeking monetary sanctions against gcco in the amount of million a multiple of the jury verdict based on allegations that gcco and or its trial counsel improperly withheld and or attempted to influence testimony in respect to the case 
pursuant to the parties written agreement to resolve this dispute  on january  the million judgment was dismissed with prejudice making the judgment against gcco null and void and plaintiff s motion seeking monetary sanctions against gcco in the amount of million a multiple of the jury verdict deemed withdrawn with prejudice 
silica gcco is one of approximately to defendants in ten active california superior court lawsuits

teichert son  inc  harris vs 
a aggregates  et al  kammer vs 
a aggregates  et al  and solis vs 
the m company et al each lawsuit was brought by a single plaintiff who is seeking money damages by way of various causes of action  including strict product and market share liability  and alleges personal injuries caused by exposure to silica products and related materials during the plaintiffs use or association with sand blasting or grinding concrete 
the plaintiff in each lawsuit has categorized the defendants as equipment defendants  respirator defendants  premises defendants and sand defendants 
we have been identified as a sand defendant  meaning a party that manufactured  supplied or distributed silica containing products 
our preliminary investigation revealed that we have not knowingly sold or distributed abrasive silica sand for sandblasting  and therefore  we believe the probability of these lawsuits resulting in an incurrence of a material liability is remote 
we have been dismissed from fourteen other similar lawsuits 
in addition  we have been apprised of three complaints that are based on similar allegations of exposure to silica containing products being filed  but not served  against gcco and more than other defendants in california superior court 
hiawatha project dbe issues the hiawatha light rail transit hlrt project was performed by minnesota transit constructors mntc  a joint venture that consisted of gcco  and other unrelated companies 
gcco was the managing partner of the joint venture  with a interest 
the minnesota department of transportation mndot is the contracting agency for this federally funded project 
the mndot and the us department of transportation office of inspector general oig each conducted a review of the disadvantaged business enterprise dbe program maintained by mntc for the hlrt project 
in addition  the us department of justice usdoj  is conducting an investigation into compliance issues with respect to mntc s dbe program for the hlrt project 
the mndot and the oig collectively the agencies have initially identified certain compliance issues in connection with mntc s dbe program  and as a result  have determined that mntc failed to meet the dbe utilization as represented by mntc 
there has been no formal administrative subpoena issued  nor has a civil complaint been filed in connection with the administrative reviews or the investigation 
the mntc is fully cooperating with all of the agencies involved and will be provided an opportunity to informally present its response to the initial determinations of the agencies as well as the investigation of the usdoj 

table of contents other we are a party to a number of other legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business which  from time to time  includes inquiries from public agencies seeking information concerning our compliance with government construction contracting requirements and related laws and regulations 
we believe that the nature and number of these proceedings are typical for a construction firm of our size and scope 
our litigation typically involves claims regarding public liability or contract related issues 
while management currently believes  after consultation with counsel  that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings  individually and in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or overall trends in results of operations or cash flows  litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties 
were an unfavorable ruling to occur  there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of operations  cash flows and or financial position for the period in which the ruling occurs 
while any one of our pending legal proceedings is subject to early resolution as a result of our ongoing efforts to settle  whether or when any legal proceeding will resolve through settlement is neither predictable nor guaranteed

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general we are one of the largest heavy civil contractors in the united states as well as one of the largest construction materials production companies in the western united states 
we are engaged in the construction of highways  dams  airport infrastructure  mass transit facilities and other infrastructure related projects 
we have offices in alaska  arizona  california  florida  minnesota  nevada  new york  oregon  texas  utah and washington 
our business involves two operating segments the branch division and the heavy construction division 
our contracts are obtained primarily through competitive bidding in response to advertisements by federal  state and local agencies and private parties and to a lesser extent through negotiation with private parties 
our bidding activity is affected by such factors as backlog  current utilization of equipment and other resources  ability to obtain necessary surety bonds and competitive considerations 
bidding activity  backlog and revenue resulting from the award of new contracts may vary significantly from period to period 
the two primary economic drivers of our business are federal  state and local public funding levels and the overall health of the economy  both nationally and locally 
the level of demand for our services will have a direct correlation to these drivers 
for example  a weak economy will generally result in a reduced demand for construction in the private sector 
this reduced demand increases competition for fewer private sector projects and will ultimately also increase competition in the public sector as companies migrate from bidding on scarce private sector work to projects in the public sector 
greater competition can reduce revenue growth and or increase pressure on gross profit margins 
a weak economy also tends to produce less tax revenue  thereby decreasing the funds available for spending on public infrastructure improvements 
there are funding sources that have been specifically earmarked for infrastructure spending  such as gasoline taxes  which are not necessarily directly impacted by a weak economy 
however  even these funds can be temporarily at risk as state and local governments struggle to balance their budgets 
conversely  higher public funding and or a robust economy will increase demand for our services and provide opportunities for revenue growth and margin improvement 
our general and administrative costs include salaries and related expenses  incentive compensation  discretionary profit sharing and other variable compensation  as well as other overhead costs to support our overall business 
in general  these costs will increase in response to the growth and the related increased complexity of our business 
these costs may also vary depending on the number of projects in process in a particular area and the corresponding level of estimating activity 
for example  as large projects are completed or if the level of work slows down in a particular area  we will often re assign project employees to estimating and bidding activities until another project gets underway  temporarily moving their salaries and related costs from cost of revenue to general and administrative expense 
additionally  our compensation strategy for selected management personnel is to rely heavily on a variable cash and restricted stock performance based incentive element 
the cash portion of these incentives is expensed when earned while the restricted stock portion is expensed over the vesting period of the stock generally five years 
depending on the mix of cash and restricted stock  these incentives can have the effect of increasing general and administrative expenses in very profitable years and decreasing expenses in less profitable years 
current year overview comparative financial summary years ended december  in thousands total revenue gross profit general and administrative expenses provision for reversal of legal judgment goodwill impairment charge  gain on sale of property and equipment operating income net income 
table of contents our results of operations for the year ended december  reflect increased operating income from our branch division compared with the corresponding period in  which was primarily driven by the strong economy in the west and the ability to work well into the fourth quarter due to mild weather conditions 
the branch division s operating results also include the results of the fourth quarter settlement and partial reversal of a provision related to an unfavorable legal judgment previously recorded in these improved results were offset by an operating loss in our heavy construction division due primarily to additional costs recorded as a result of changes in the estimates of the cost to complete certain projects and a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million related to our granite northeast operation in new york 
operating income for the year ended december  includes approximately million related to sales of certain real estate development assets by our granite land company subsidiary approximately million net of our minority partners share 
additionally  our net income for the year ended december  reflects an increase in non operating income of approximately million due primarily to higher interest income in critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience  however  actual amounts could differ from those estimates 
certain of our accounting policies and estimates require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include the recognition of revenue and earnings from construction contracts  the valuation of long lived assets and insurance estimates 
we evaluate all of our estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
revenue recognition for construction contracts our contracts with our customers are primarily either fixed unit price or fixed price 
under fixed unit price contracts  we are committed to provide materials or services required by a project at fixed unit prices for example  dollars per cubic yard of concrete poured or cubic yards of earth excavated 
while the fixed unit price contract shifts the risk of estimating the quantity of units required for a particular project to the customer  any increase in our unit cost over the expected unit cost in the bid  whether due to inflation  inefficiency  faulty estimates or other factors  is borne by us unless otherwise provided in the contract 
fixed price contracts are priced on a lump sum basis under which we bear the risk that we may not be able to perform all the work profitably for the specified contract amount 
the percentage of fixed price contracts in our backlog increased from approximately at december  to approximately at december  all state and federal government contracts and many of our other contracts provide for termination of the contract for the convenience of the party contracting with us  with provisions to pay us for work performed through the date of termination 
we use the percentage of completion accounting method for construction contracts in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
revenue and earnings on construction contracts  including construction joint ventures  are recognized using the percentage of completion method in the ratio of costs incurred to estimated final costs 
revenue in an amount equal to cost incurred is recognized prior to contracts reaching completion 
the related profit is deferred until the period in which such percentage completion is attained 
it is our judgment that until a project reaches completion  there is insufficient information to determine what the estimated profit on the project will be with a reasonable level of assurance 
additionally  as a result of experience gained on past design build projects  we now evaluate each design build project individually to determine whether it is appropriate to begin profit recognition at completion or at a later point 
the factors considered in this evaluation of risk associated with each design build project include the stage of design completion  the stage of construction completion  status of outstanding purchase orders and subcontracts  certainty of quantities  certainty of schedule and the relationship with the owner 
revenue from contract claims is recognized when we have a signed settlement agreement and payment is assured 
revenue from contract change orders  which occur in most large projects  is recognized when the owner has agreed to the change order in writing 
provisions are recognized in the statement of income for the full amount of estimated losses on uncompleted contracts whenever evidence indicates that the estimated total cost of a contract exceeds its estimated total revenue 
contract cost consists of direct costs on contracts  including labor and materials  amounts payable to subcontractors  direct overhead costs and equipment expense primarily depreciation  fuel  maintenance and repairs 
depreciation is provided using accelerated methods for construction equipment 
contract cost is recorded as incurred and revisions in contract revenue and cost estimates are reflected when known 
the completion threshold for the start of contract profit recognition is applied to all percentage of completion projects without exception unless and until we project a loss on the project  in which case the estimated loss is immediately recognized 

table of contents the accuracy of our revenue and profit recognition in a given period is almost solely dependent on the accuracy of our estimates of the cost to complete each project 
our cost estimates for all of our significant projects use a highly detailed bottom up approach and we believe our experience allows us to provide materially reliable estimates 
there are a number of factors that can contribute to changes in estimates of contract cost and profitability 
the most significant of these include the completeness and accuracy of the original bid  costs associated with added scope changes  extended overhead due primarily to owner and weather delays  subcontractor performance issues  changes in productivity expectations  site conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid to the extent contract remedies are unavailable  the availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of the project and a change in the availability and proximity of equipment and materials 
the foregoing factors as well as the stage of completion of contracts in process and the mix of contracts at different margins may cause fluctuations in gross profit between periods and these fluctuations may be significant 
substantial changes in cost estimates  particularly in the larger  more complex projects in our heavy construction division  have had and can in future periods have a significant effect on our profitability 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets  which include property  equipment and acquired identifiable intangibles  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of asset useful lives and future cash flows 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by management and this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
we had approximately million in goodwill at december  relating to our branch division primarily associated with our majority owned wilder construction company subsidiary 
we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and more frequently when events and circumstances occur that indicate a possible impairment of goodwill 
in determining whether there is an impairment of goodwill  we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill is recorded using a discounted future cash flow method 
we then compare the resulting fair value to the net book value of the reporting unit  including goodwill 
if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we would measure the amount of the impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
to the extent that the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  we recognize a goodwill impairment loss 
we performed our annual impairment test in and we determined that no impairment had occurred with respect to the branch division goodwill 
additionally  we performed our annual impairment test in for approximately million in goodwill related to our heavy construction division and determined that it was fully impaired see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the discounted future cash flow method used in the first step of our impairment test involves significant estimates including future cash inflows from estimated revenues  future cash outflows from estimated project cost and general and administrative costs  estimates of timing of collection and payment of various items and future growth rates as well as discount rate and terminal value assumptions 
although we believe the estimates and assumptions that we used in testing for impairment are reasonable and supportable  significant changes in any one of these assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
insurance estimates we carry insurance policies to cover various risks  primarily general liability and workers compensation  under which we are liable to reimburse the insurance company for a portion of each claim paid 
the amounts that we are liable for generally range from the first  to million per occurrence 
we accrue for the estimated ultimate liability for incurred losses  both reported and unreported  using actuarial methods based on historic trends modified  if necessary  by recent events 
changes in our loss assumptions caused by changes in actual experience would result in a change in our assessment of the ultimate liability that could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position

increased revenue from the sale of materials reflects an increase in average selling prices in although our private sector revenue remains strong  we continue to see a reduction in residential development opportunities

approximately of the hcd backlog at december  relates to projects that have forecasted a loss 
the forecasted losses have been recognized in the period s they were identified

table of contents gross profit years ended december  in thousands branch division gross profit percent of division revenue heavy construction division gross profit percent of division revenue other total gross profit percent of revenue gross profit as more fully described under critical accounting estimates we recognize revenue only equal to cost  deferring profit recognition  until a project reaches completion 
in certain cases  such as large  complex design build projects  we may continue to defer profit recognition beyond the point of completion until such time as we believe we have enough information to make a reasonably dependable estimate of contract revenue and cost 
because we have a large number of projects at various stages of completion in our branch division  this policy generally has very little impact on the branch division s gross profit on a quarterly or annual basis 
however  hcd has fewer projects in process at any given time and those projects tend to be much larger than branch division projects 
as a result  hcd gross profit as a percent of revenue can vary significantly in periods where one or several very large projects reach our completion threshold and the deferred profit is recognized or conversely  in periods where backlog is growing rapidly and a higher percentage of projects are in their early stages with no associated gross margin recognition 
revenue from projects less than our completion threshold  for which no margin has been recognized  was as follows revenue from contracts with deferred profit years ended december  in thousands branch division heavy construction division total revenue from contracts with deferred profit additionally  as we also describe under critical accounting estimates we do not recognize revenue from contract claims until we have a signed agreement and payment is assured and we do not recognize revenue from contract change orders until the contract owner has agreed to the change order in writing 
however  we do recognize the costs related to any contract claims or pending change orders in our forecasts when we are contractually obligated to incur them 
as a result  our gross profit as a percent of revenue can vary during periods where a large volume of change orders or contract claims are pending resolution reducing gross profit percent or  conversely  during periods where large change orders or contract claims are agreed or settled increasing gross profit percent 
although this variability can occur in both our branch division and hcd  it can be much more pronounced in hcd because of the larger size of its projects 
gross profit as a percent of revenue in our branch division increased to in from in the increase in is attributable to higher profit margins for both construction and the sale of materials due to strong demand in both the private and public sectors 
branch division construction gross profit as a percent of revenue in increased to from in branch division gross profit from the sale of materials as a percent of revenue in increased to from in branch division gross profit for includes the effects of changes in the estimates of the profitability of certain projects 
the net impact of these estimate changes for was an increase to gross profit of approximately million due primarily to the settlement of outstanding issues on two projects with no associated cost  partially offset by increases in estimated costs on several other projects 
the net impact of such estimate changes for was a decrease to gross profit of approximately million due primarily to unanticipated costs related to quality issues in work originally performed by a subcontractor on one project and changes in site conditions from our original expectations on a second project 

table of contents hcd recognized a negative gross margin of for the year ended december  compared to a gross profit margin of for the reduction in gross margin was primarily due to additional estimated project costs that had the effect of reducing gross profit by approximately million in this compares with reduced gross margin from reductions in estimated project profitability of approximately million in see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
additionally hcd s gross margin in was negatively impacted by lower estimated profitability in the division s backlog at the beginning of resulting from the deterioration in estimated project margins experienced during when there are contract forecast changes having the significance of those we experienced in  we undergo a process that includes reviewing the nature of the changes to ensure that there are no material amounts that should have been recorded in a prior period rather than as a change in estimate 
in our review of these changes  we did not identify any material amounts that should have been recorded in a prior period

during the fourth quarter of we performed our annual impairment test and determined that the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeded its implied fair value and that a full impairment of goodwill existed 
this impairment conclusion was reached due to continuing losses at gne  including significant unexpected losses in the quarter ended december  which have caused us to re evaluate our strategy in new york 
we continue to believe that the new york market will present opportunities for us to build profitable work

we recognized net minority interest benefit of approximately million for the year ended december  primarily due to losses on certain construction joint venture projects 
four of our joint venture projects are currently forecast at a loss and will require additional capital contributions from our minority partners if the forecasts do not improve 
our joint venture agreements require that such capital contributions be made if needed 
based on our most recent assessment of our partners financial condition  we currently believe that two of our partners do not have the ability to contribute all of the additional capital that will be needed if the project forecasts do not improve 
during the fourth quarter of  we received updated financial information that caused concerns about these partners liquidity 
included in the net minority interest benefit for the year ended december  is expense related to these potentially uncollectible partner balances of approximately million 
the remaining minority interest balance related to these loss projects of million at december  has been included in other long term assets in our consolidated balance sheet 
outlook on february   we announced a strategic and organizational realignment of our business which is expected to be completed over the next months 
the realignment is designed to accommodate growth of our vertically integrated branch business in the west and improve profitability on our large  complex heavy construction division hcd projects 
a key component of our corporate strategy over the coming years is to expand our vertically integrated branch business model into new geographies in the west and right size our large projects business 
by realigning our business and resources into granite west and granite east  we feel that we will be in better position to take full advantage of the long term opportunities and strong market conditions we foresee for our business 
led by senior vice president james h 
roberts  granite west will be structured to strategically support the growth of our construction and construction materials businesses 
the western portion of our current large projects business will be integrated into granite west by carefully capitalizing on granite west s capacity  people and assets  as well as its extensive and proven management and support structure 
we will retain our successful decentralized operating structure within granite west  with each branch location aligning under one of three operating groups northwest  northern california and southwest 
each branch will remain intact with little or no change in their operations and will report to a newly created position  granite west group vice president 
each of the three group vice presidents will oversee three to six branches and will have the responsibility to stimulate strategic thinking and growth in their geographic territory 
among other key benefits  this structure will allow granite west to utilize its resources and market knowledge to take advantage of the larger projects we expect to be let as a result of healthy state funding and the recently passed propositions in california 
led by senior vice president michael f 
donnino  granite east will be aligned to focus on enhancing project management oversight and discipline from estimating through execution 
granite east will leverage its resources and core capabilities in areas where it has local knowledge  local relationships  and local resources 
it will be operated out of three regional offices the central region  based in dallas  texas  the southeast region  based in tampa  florida  and the northeast region  based in tarrytown  new york 
the demand for our construction services in the public sector is very high 
state and federal funding for transportation projects is very promising 
last november  california voters approved a major bond issue that should provide billion for transportation related improvements over the next ten years 
voters also approved a measure that would require california to stop diverting revenues from the state sales tax on motor vehicle fuels to non transportation purposes 
early assessments of the california department of transportation caltrans contracting levels for the fiscal year beginning july may reach or exceed record levels 
we currently expect the bond monies to translate into new work by the second half of with bottom line impact evident in and beyond 

table of contents while residential housing work in our private sector markets has slowed considerably  we believe the robust public sector market as well as continued strength in private sector commercial construction may offset the slowdown in the residential market 
in addition to california  our markets in utah  arizona and washington are also expected to be strong in however  public sector funding in nevada is more restricted than normal due to a large highway project that is reducing monies available for smaller projects throughout the state 
the ownership of aggregate materials has proven to be extremely valuable both as a resource for our core construction business as well as a strategic and profitable retail business 
our long term plan is to continue to invest in this part of our business by acquiring additional aggregate reserves  permitting or green fielding new facilities and expanding our existing operations to have at least a year reserve life at all of our locations 
we expect demand for our construction materials to remain healthy throughout the coming year 
while sales volumes to third parties are expected to remain relatively flat  we believe that if we are able to manage production costs effectively and aggregates prices continue to improve  the prospects are good for another successful year for our construction materials business in the west 
congress recently appropriated and the president signed into law safetea lu level funding of billion for the federal highway program 
the approved amount is a increase over the fiscal level 
safetea lu is a six year federal transportation bill that runs through fiscal and calls for billion in guaranteed funding for highways  transit and highway safety 
these guaranteed funding levels established under safetea lu help guide congress through the annual appropriations process  which determines yearly funding for the federal highway  transit and airport construction programs 
our industry continues to be challenged with a shortage of skilled labor  and we expect the industry will continue to face this challenge as the demand for construction related services remains strong or grows across the united states 
at granite  we are working diligently to implement specialized training programs to develop our people and improve their skills while proactively hiring skilled employees  both professional and craft  and continuing to focus on retention 
our investment in our employee development initiative is an important strategic initiative that we believe will allow us to turn the shortage of labor in the marketplace into an advantage for granite 
as we have stated previously  we are subject to oil price volatility as it relates to our use of liquid asphalt and diesel fuel 
some of our projects are indexed and include price escalation clauses that provide protection in the event that petroleum product prices increase significantly 
although we are exposed to price spikes in projects that do not include such clauses  we have historically been able to recover some or all of those costs when prices come down 
with respect to steel  we are exposed to price increases and steel delivery delays on some of our hcd projects that are currently under construction 
while we do have some exposure in these areas of our business  we have not been materially adversely impacted to date 
in an effort to minimize our exposure on future projects  we are closely monitoring the industry s outlook on future pricing so that we can reflect anticipated future price escalation in our bids 
in the short term  our business in the west is poised to take advantage of a number of opportunities that lie ahead in pricing for construction materials is expected to be healthy next year as demand for aggregates remains strong 
in hcd  we expect consolidated revenue to be approximately million next year 
this compares with billion in revenue for the division in in addition  we are currently forecasting hcd to break even in followed by a return to acceptable operating margins as the older backlog is worked off and the benefits of the organizational realignment are realized 
overall  we are encouraged by the on going demand for our construction services and materials as well as the positive outlook for transportation related funding throughout most of our markets 
we are excited about the strategic and organizational realignment of our large projects business and the opportunities it will provide for us to continue to build long term shareholder value 
prior years revenue revenue from our branch division increased million  or  in the year ended december  from the year ended december  this increase was largely driven by a strong housing market  particularly in california and nevada

in march  one of the two services rating a series of these bonds reduced their rating to below investment grade 
on february   the second rating service also reduced its rating  citing serious concerns about whether the project s fare revenues would be adequate to pay the series of bonds that we hold

generally  our construction joint ventures are not subject to income taxes on a stand alone basis 
also contributing to the decreased effective tax rate in was the impact of a deduction based on income from qualified domestic production activities under the american jobs creation act of minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries the increase in minority interest in compared with was due to higher profitability of our consolidated subsidiaries in liquidity and capital resources december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents excluding consolidated joint ventures consolidated joint venture cash and cash equivalents  total consolidated cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities capital expenditures working capital our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities 
we expect the principal use of funds for the foreseeable future will be for acquisitions  capital expenditures  working capital  debt service and other investments

our cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term marketable securities totaled million at december  and included million of cash from our consolidated joint ventures see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
this joint venture cash is for the working capital needs of each joint venture s project 
the decision to distribute cash must generally be made jointly by all of the partners 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash generated from operations and amounts available under our existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our expected working capital needs  capital expenditures  financial commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations through the next twelve months and beyond 
if we experience a significant change in our business such as the execution of a significant acquisition  we would likely need to acquire additional sources of financing  which may be limited by the terms of our existing debt covenants  or may require the amendment of our existing debt agreements 
cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  represents an increase of million from the amount provided by operating activities during although accounts receivable were higher at december  than at december  due to higher revenue in  the balance increased at a lower rate in the year ended december  than in due to higher cash collections contributing to the increase in cash from operations 
additionally  the increase was due to higher net income prior to the non cash goodwill impairment charge and higher net billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings resulting primarily from large cash payments received to mobilize projects in the early stages of construction  which have the effect of increasing cash flow in the periods received and decreasing cash flow in subsequent periods as cash is expended towards project completion

in  our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to million of our common stock of which million remained at december we had standby letters of credit totaling approximately million outstanding at december   all of which expire between february and march we are generally required by the beneficiaries of these standby letters of credit to replace them upon expiration 
additionally  we generally are required to provide various types of surety bonds that provide an additional measure of security under certain public and private sector contracts 
at december   approximately billion of our backlog was bonded and performance bonds totaling approximately billion were outstanding 
performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates  rather  we are generally released from the bonds when each contract is accepted by the owner 
the ability to maintain bonding capacity to support our current and future level of contracting requires that we maintain cash and working capital balances satisfactory to our sureties 

table of contents we have a million bank revolving line of credit  which allows for unsecured borrowings through june   with interest rate options

wilder was in compliance with these covenants at december  failure to comply with these covenants could cause the amounts due under the debt agreements to become currently payable 
joint ventures  off balance sheet arrangements we participate in various construction joint venture partnerships in order to share expertise  risk and resources for certain highly complex projects 
generally  each construction joint venture is formed to accomplish a specific project and is jointly controlled by the joint venture partners 
we select our joint venture partners based on our analysis of their construction and financial capabilities  expertise in the type of work to be performed and past working relationships with us  among other criteria 
the joint venture agreements typically provide that our interests in any profits and assets  and our respective share in any losses and liabilities that may result from the performance of the contract are limited to our stated percentage interest in the project 
under each joint venture agreement  one partner is designated as the sponsor 
the sponsoring partner typically provides all administrative  accounting and most of the project management support for the project and generally receives a fee from the joint venture for these services 
we have been designated as the sponsoring partner in certain of our current joint venture projects and are a non sponsoring partner in others 
we also participate in various line item joint venture agreements under which each partner is responsible for performing certain discrete items of the total scope of contracted work 
the revenue for these discrete items is defined in the contract with the project owner and each venture partner bears the profitability risk associated with its own work 
all partners in a line item joint venture are jointly and severally liable for the completion of the total project under the terms of the contract with the project owner 
there is not a single set of books and records for a line item joint venture 
each partner accounts for its items of work individually as it would for any self performed contract 
we account for our portion of these contracts as project revenues and costs in our accounting system and include receivables and payables associated with our work in our consolidated financial statements 
the venture s contract with the project owner typically requires joint and several liability among the joint venture partners 
although our agreements with our joint venture partners for both construction joint ventures and line item joint ventures provide that each party will assume and pay its share of any losses resulting from a project  if one of our partners was unable to pay its share we would be fully liable under our contract with the project owner 
circumstances that could lead to a loss under these guarantee arrangements include a partner s inability to contribute additional funds to the venture in the event that the project incurred a loss or additional costs that we could incur should the partner fail to provide the services and resources toward project completion that had been committed to in the joint venture agreement 
at december   approximately million of work representing either our partners proportionate share of unconsolidated construction joint ventures or work that our partners are directly responsible for in line item joint ventures  had yet to be completed 
during we recorded approximately million in additional minority interest cost related to our assessment that our partners in two construction joint venture projects would be unable to pay their full share of the projects projected losses 
prior to we had never incurred a loss under these joint and several liability provisions  however  it is possible that we could record additional losses in the future and such losses could be significant

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks due largely to changes in interest rates  which we have managed primarily by managing the maturities in our investment portfolio 
we currently do not have any material business transactions in foreign currencies 
the fair value of our short term held to maturity investment portfolio and related income would not be significantly impacted by changes in interest rates since the investment maturities are short and the interest rates are primarily fixed 
the fair value of our long term held to maturity investment portfolio may be impacted by changes in interest rates

the estimated fair value of our long term held to maturity investments approximates the principal amounts above due to the relatively minor difference between the effective yields of these investments and rates currently available on similar instruments 
rates currently available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities are used to estimate fair value of existing debt 
based on the lower fixed borrowing rates currently available to us for bank loans with similar terms and average maturities  the fair value of the senior notes payable was approximately million as of december  and million as of december
