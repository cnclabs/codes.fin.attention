item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the company incurred a net income to holders of common stock of  or per share in compared to a net income of  or per share in and compared to a net loss of  or per share in the company realized revenues of  in compared to  in and compared to  in revenues increased  from due primarily to an increase in oil production in kansas of approximately  net barrels of oil bbls over levels 
an increase in oil prices accounted for of the increased revenues in and the increase in produced volumes accounted for of the increased revenues 
the company has offset the normal decline curve in its kansas properties with additional drilling and well work overs 
the gross volumes of oil of  bbls would have been approximately  bbls without additional drilling and well work overs 
the company sold  bbls of oil in and  in the volume of gas sold from the swan creek field decreased to  mcf in from  mcf in and the volume of oil sold from swan creek field decreased to  barrels in from  barrels in the decline in volumes of oil and gas produced in the swan creek field from existing wells is normal for producing wells and the declines as experienced were not unexpected 
the company s gas production in kansas in was only for the month of january  mcf as the company s kansas gas field was sold on march  with the buyer s production being retroactive to february  the kansas gas field had produced  mcf of gas in gas prices received for sales of gas from the swan creek field averaged per mcf in  per mcf in  and in oil prices received for sales of oil from the swan creek field averaged per barrel in  per barrel in  and in oil prices received for sales of oil in kansas averaged per barrel in  per barrel in  and in the company s subsidiary  tpc  had pipeline transportation revenues of  in   in  and  in the decreases in revenues in and from resulted from the decrease in volumes of gas produced from the swan creek field 
production costs and taxes in of  remained consistent with levels in of  and in of  depletion  depreciation  and amortization increased to  in from  in which was a decrease from  in the increase in is due to a change in focus by the company toward drilling in kansas rather than in tennessee  therefore removing drilling and development locations in tennessee 
the decrease in from levels was due mainly to depletion levels on the kansas properties in decreasing in due to the sale of the kansas gas field effective february  the company s general and administrative costs of  in remained generally consistent with levels of  and levels of  the and costs included non cash charges related to stock options of  and  respectively 
interest expense for decreased significantly over and levels 
the substantial decrease is the result of the payoff in of the company s loans from bank one  na and dolphin offshore partners  lp and the conversion in and of all the company s preferred stock  which was subject to mandatory redemption  into either interests in a drilling program  common stock or cash payoffs 
as of december  the company s only debt financing are vehicle loans totaling  and the citibank loan of  the company s public relations costs remained stable at  for  compared to  for and  for as the company continued to apply cost saving methods in the preparation of its annual report and in publishing of press releases 
professional fees in were  compared to  in and  in these fees were greatly reduced in due to the elimination of outside counsels legal fees following a settlement of company litigation in the remaining professional fees in relate primarily to audit and engineering services 
during  the company recorded a gain from extinguishment of debt in the amount of  from the bank one litigation settlement and a gain on disposal of preferred stock of  the company also recorded a loss on sale of a drilling rig during of  the company recorded a gain on disposal of preferred stock of  in liquidity and capital resources management believes that the company s foundation for future growth began to solidify in in  all material litigation involving the company was resolved  eliminating the substantial ongoing costs and expenses of such litigation 
capital restructuring began in february  when the company s rights offering to its then shareholders successfully raised sufficient capital to pay in full all pre existing secured debt in the amount of million  most of which had been obtained at relatively high interest rates 
also in early certain unsecured convertible notes entered into in in the principal amount of million were fully paid  and still other convertible notes entered into in in the original principal amount of  were paid in full in march in december  the company completed an exchange offer to the thirteen holders of all of the company s series a cumulative convertible preferred stock series a shares in the face value of  seven of the thirteen holders elected the cash exchange option  and the face value of  of series a shares was exchanged for a cash payment of  the company obtained funds for the exchange from cash on hand and the proceeds of a loan from dolphin offshore partners  lp dolphin the company s largest shareholder 
peter e

the loan from dolphin was in the form of a secured note in principal amount of  bearing interest per annum 
five of the thirteen series a shareholders selected a drilling program exchange option and on december  the face value of  of series a shares plus dividend value of  was exchanged for of the eight units in an eight well drilling program on the company s kansas properties the eight well program 
in december the last remaining series a preferred shareholder exchanged his preferred stock for cash on essentially identical terms as received by the other series a owners who had exchanged their shares for cash 
in early  the company elected to sell its gas producing properties in rush county  kansas for million and to utilize all the net proceeds of the sale to pay down the million debt to dolphin incurred by the company to fund the settlement of the litigation with the company s former primary lender  bank one na  in may  this had the effect of reducing the principal balance of the note evidencing that loan from million to  correspondingly reducing the high interest payments on that note and reducing the total secured debt owed by the company to dolphin to approximately  represented by a promissory note dated may   in the principal amount of  to dolphin the  note 
in august  all of the holders of the company s series b and c cumulative convertible preferred stock the series b and series c shares in the total aggregate value of  consisting of face value  dividends  and interest exchanged their series b and c shares for cash or for the company s common stock 
the cash option exchange provided for a cash payment equal to of the face value together with any unpaid accrued dividends 
holders of approximately of the face value of outstanding series b and c shares selected this option  exchanging preferred shares having an aggregate value of  for cash payments totaling 
the company obtained the funds for this exchange primarily from proceeds of a loan of  from dolphin evidenced by a secured promissory note bearing interest the  note 
the second option offered to the holders of the series b and c shares was to exchange their series b and c shares for four shares of the company s common stock for each dollar of the face value and unpaid accrued dividends and interest on their series b and c shares 
the holders of the remaining aggregate value of  or of the series b and c shares including dolphin selected this option 
as a result  a total of  shares of the company s common stock were issued to holders of series b and c shares 
of this total number   shares of unregistered common stock were issued to dolphin in exchange for the  in aggregate value of the series b shares held by dolphin 
as a result of this exchange  as of august  the company no longer had any preferred stockholders and no further obligations under the series b and c shares 
on october  the company and hoactzin partners  lp hoactzin signed an agreement whereby hoactzin surrendered the  and  notes and exchanged the company s obligation to repay this principal amount of million for a working interest in a new twelve well drilling program the twelve well program on the company s properties in kansas 
the company retained the working interest in the twelve well program not owned by hoactzin 
the principal of the notes exchanged by hoactzin represented the funds paid by the company for the previous exchanges for cash of the company s series a  b  and c preferred stock 
the controlling person of hoactzin is peter e 
salas  the chairman of the company s board of directors and the controlling person of dolphin 
under the terms of the twelve well program  the company retained an option expiring march  to repurchase from hoactzin the obligations to drill the final six wells of the twelve well program for one half of the principal of notes exchanged by hoactzin  plus interest on that amount at per annum until the date of any repurchase  plus a overriding royalty to hoactzin on all wells drilled in the twelve well program 
payout and management fee calculations would also be adjusted to reflect any reduction to a six well program 
on june  the company closed a  revolving senior credit facility between the company and citibank texas  na in its own capacity and also as agent for other banks 
under the facility  loans and letters of credit will be available to the company on a revolving basis in an amount outstanding not to exceed the lesser of  or the borrowing base in effect from time to time 
the company s initial borrowing base was set at  the initial loan under the facility with citibank closed on june  in the principal amount of million  bearing interest at a floating rate equal to libor plus  resulting in a current rate of interest of approximately 
interest only is payable during the term of the loan and the principal balance of the loan is due thirty six months from closing 
the facility is secured by a lien on substantially all of the company s producing and non producing oil and gas properties and pipeline assets 
on june  the company used million of the proceeds of the million loan to exercise the company s option to repurchase from hoactzin partners  lp  the company s obligation to drill for hoactzin the final six wells of the company s twelve well program 
if the company had not exercised its repurchase option  hoactzin would have received a working interest in the final six wells of the twelve well program until payout as established under the terms of the twelve well program program 
however  as a result of the terms of the repurchase option  hoactzin will receive only a overriding royalty in the next six company wells to be drilled  plus an additional overriding royalty in the six program wells that have previously been drilled 
as a further result of the repurchase  the twelve well program was converted into a six well program  and because six wells had been drilled by the company as of june  the drilling obligation in this program were satisfied upon exercise of the repurchase option 
consequently  as of june   all well drilling obligations of the company owed to participants have been satisfied as to both the eight well program offered to the former series a preferred stockholders and the twelve well program offered to hoactzin and converted to a well program upon the company s repurchase of the obligation to drill the last six wells as described above 
as of december  all of the obligations of the company to drill wells under the eight well program and twelve now six well program have been satisfied 
under the terms of those programs  upon payment to the participants of of the value invested in the program from proceeds from production  the participants will pay the company a management fee of of their proceeds 
as to the eight well program  that point is expected to be reached in early resulting in an increase in revenues from these wells to the company of approximately  per month at current volumes and prices 
as to the twelve now well program  that point is expected to be reached some time in or depending upon prices and production levels experienced from the wells in that program 
as of june  the company had completed a total reworking of its balance sheets that has been occurring since february the company has resolved all major litigation and eliminated the accompanying legal fees 
the company s successful rights offering in february raised capital to pay off substantial debt 
the company also sold its small block of gas properties in kansas obtaining a dollar benefit of high gas prices reflected in the million sales price while simultaneously eliminating the high operating expenses of those properties 
the company used proceeds of the gas property sale to further pay down debt 
the company has also met its obligations to all of its preferred stockholders by exchanging their preferred stock either for cash  stock  or drilling program interests  and has accordingly cancelled all of the series a  b  and c preferred stock 
the company has completed all of its well drilling obligations to the drilling program participants out of its own cash flow from operations and without additional borrowing for drilling 
the company continues to successfully rework existing wells  to drill new oil wells in kansas and is acquiring additional lease acreage to increase production and to grow its reserves through the drill bit 
all the while the company has benefited from the currently high commodity prices for oil and gas and has used higher prices and increasing production volumes to conservatively fuel the reworking of the balance sheets and to prepare the company for those times in the future when commodity prices may not be as favorable which is a part of the business cycle that is well known and almost universally expected to some degree as an element of the oil and gas industry

actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing the company s financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company s results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenues based on actual volumes of oil and gas sold and delivered to its customers 
natural gas meters are placed at the customers location and usage is billed each month 
crude oil is stored and at the time of delivery to the customers  revenues are recognized 
full cost method of accounting the company follows the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas property acquisition  exploration and development activities 
under this method  all productive and non productive costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of  exploration for and development of oil and gas reserves for each cost center are capitalized 
capitalized costs include lease acquisitions  geological and geophysical work  day rate rentals and the costs of drilling  completing and equipping oil and gas wells 
costs  however  associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
interest costs related to unproved properties and properties under development are also capitalized to oil and gas properties 
gains or losses are recognized only upon sales or dispositions of significant amounts of oil and gas reserves representing an entire cost center 
proceeds from all other sales or dispositions are treated as reductions to capitalized costs 
the capitalized oil and gas property  less accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization and related deferred income taxes  if any  are generally limited to an amount the ceiling limitation equal to the sum of a the present value of estimated future net revenues computed by applying current prices in effect as of the balance sheet date with consideration of price changes only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements to estimated future production of proved oil and gas reserves  less estimated future expenditures based on current costs to be incurred in developing and producing the reserves using a discount factor of and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions  and b the cost of investments in unevaluated properties excluded from the costs being amortized 
no ceiling write downs were recorded in  or oil and gas reserves depletion depreciation and amortization of oil and gas properties the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  plus estimated future development costs relating to proved reserves and estimated costs of plugging and abandonment  net of estimated salvage value  are amortized on the unit of production method based on total proved reserves 
the costs of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated  subject to an annual assessment of whether impairment has occurred 
the company s proved oil and gas reserves as of december  were determined by laroche petroleum consultants  ltd 
projecting the effects of commodity prices on production  and timing of development expenditures includes many factors beyond the company s control 
the future estimates of net cash flows from the company s proved reserves and their present value are based upon various assumptions about future production levels  prices  and costs that may prove to be incorrect over time 
any significant variance from assumptions could result in the actual future net cash flows being materially different from the estimates 
asset retirement obligations the company is required to record the effects of contractual or other legal obligations on well abandonments for capping and plugging wells 
management periodically reviews the estimate of the timing of the wells closure as well as the estimated closing costs  discounted at the credit adjusted risk free rate of 
quarterly  management accretes the discount into the liability and makes other adjustments to the liability for well retirements incurred during the period 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb published statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  sfas r share based payment 
sfas r established standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
sfas r eliminated the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and generally required that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas r applies to all awards granted after the required effective date and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after that date and as a consequence future employee stock option grants and other stock based compensation plans will be recorded as expense over the vesting period of the award based on their fair values at the date the stock based compensation is granted 
the cumulative effect of initially applying sfas r is to be recognized as of the required effective date using a modified prospective method 
under the modified prospective method the company recognized stock based compensation expense from july  as if the fair value based accounting method had been used to account for all outstanding unvested employee awards granted  modified or settled in prior years 
the company adopted sfas r in and recognized  in compensation expense for options granted in and  in the company will recognize  in and in compensation expense relating to those options granted in the ultimate impact on future years results of operation and financial position will depend upon the level of stock based compensation granted in future years 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return  including issues relating to financial statement recognition and measurement 
fin provides that the tax effects from an uncertain tax position can be recognized in the financial statements only if the position is more likely than not to be sustained if the position were to be challenged by a taxing authority 
the assessment of the tax position is based solely on the technical merits of the position  without regard to the likelihood that the tax position may be challenged 
if an uncertain tax position meets the more likely than not threshold  the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than percent likely to be recognized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority  is recorded 
the provisions of fin are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
consistent with the requirements of fin  we adopted fin on january  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin and do not expect the interpretation will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations at december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s commodity risk the company s major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its oil and gas production 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas production 
historically  prices received for oil and gas production have been volatile and unpredictable and price volatility is expected to continue 
monthly oil price realizations ranged from a low of per barrel to a high of per barrel during gas price realizations ranged from a monthly low of per mcf to a monthly high of per mcf during the same period 
the company did not enter into any hedging agreements in to limit exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations

interest rate risk at december   the company had debt outstanding of approximately  including  as of that date   owed on its credit facility with citibank texas  n 
a 
the interest rate on the citibank credit facility is variable at a rate equal to libor plus 
the company s remaining debt of  has fixed interest rates ranging from to 
as a result  the company s annual interest costs in fluctuated based on short term interest rates on approximately of its total debt outstanding at december  the impact on interest expense and the company s cash flows of a percent increase in the interest rate on the citibank credit facility would be approximately  assuming borrowed amounts under the citibank credit facility remained at the same amount owed as of december  the company did not have any open derivative contracts relating to interest rates at december  forward looking statements and risk certain statements in this report  including statements of the future plans  objectives  and expected performance of the company  are forward looking statements that are dependent upon certain events  risks and uncertainties that may be outside the company s control  and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
some of these include  but are not limited to  the market prices of oil and gas  economic and competitive conditions  inflation rates  legislative and regulatory changes  financial market conditions  political and economic uncertainties of foreign governments  future business decisions  and other uncertainties  all of which are difficult to predict 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
the total amount or timing of actual future production may vary significantly from estimates 
the drilling of exploratory wells can involve significant risks  including those related to timing  success rates and cost overruns 
lease and rig availability  complex geology and other factors can also affect these risks 
additionally  fluctuations in oil and gas prices  or a prolonged period of low prices  may substantially adversely affect the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows
