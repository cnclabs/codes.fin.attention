item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
this discussion presents a review of the major factors that have affected the financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations of britton koontz capital corporation the company and its subsidiaries  principally britton koontz bank  na the bank  as of and for the three years ended december  summary during the past three years  the company has emphasized loan and deposit growth and reduction of personnel expenses while also devoting considerable efforts to consolidate and realign branches and bank premises 
the company ended with six locations and employees  down from ten locations and employees the year before 
during  the company continued its efforts to streamline operations and ended the year with employees 
the company also experienced excellent growth in its loan and deposits in  as loans increased million to million and total deposits increased million to million 
the company s loan growth in came primarily from growth in business and industrial commercial real estate loans  including residential land development and construction loans and family residential mortgage loans 
throughout  the company operated in an environment where short term rates continued to move upward while long term rates remained the same or decreased  thus creating a flatter yield curve 
this scenario contributed to the decline in net interest margin to at december   from at december  while declining margins were prevalent throughout the industry  management believes that the company s growth in loans during helped offset the negative effects associated with a flat yield curve and actually slowed margin compression 
another major factor that aided in preventing additional declines in net interest margin and stabilizing net interest margin in was the increase in the company s non interest bearing deposits since december  the federal reserve began raising short term rates in and had raised the benchmark rate times through december   to 
as began  it became clear that the company would face significant pressure on its interest margins as the fed funds rate was increased an additional times  ending at 
not only was the short term rate increase elevating funding costs  but at the same time intermediate and longer term rates on earning assets remained the same  or even decreased  effectively capping asset yields 
this flattening and inversion of the yield curve contributed heavily to the lower levels of the company s net interest income in in light of the changes in the yield curve  management determined in that  while it would continue to aggressively seek out new opportunities to grow the bank s loans  investments and deposits  such growth should come only from assets whose margins justified the risk associated with the asset and that otherwise satisfied the company s credit standards 
management also determined that  if such growth opportunities were not available for one type of asset  funds would be directed to those assets where such growth opportunities were present and otherwise would be used to pay down long term debt  which itself would improve the company s net interest income and interest margins 
accordingly  in cash flows from the investment portfolio and the residential mortgage portfolio were redirected into higher yielding commercial loans and to the reduction in borrowings from the federal home loan bank of dallas fhlb 
these commercial loans increased million while borrowing declined by a similar amount 
the effect of this redirection of cash flows was to lower the level of total assets and the level of total liabilities by approximately million each 
the new commercial loans and the reduction of fhlb borrowings also increased the company s net interest income during this increase  however  was offset by the negative effects of the interest rate environment during more information about the volume and rate variances can be seen under the heading average balances and yield analysis and net interest income 

table of contents the company currently leases a branch on bluebonnet boulevard and intends to acquire a second site in baton rouge during the year 
management also plans to add a third branch in baton rouge by capital expenditures for equipment and software in are projected to be approximately thousand 
management expects that new purchases in will be offset by an estimated thousand in depreciation expense 
in  the company reported net income of million  or per basic and diluted share  representing an increase over the million  or and per basic and diluted share  of net income reported at december   and a increase compared to net income of million  or and per basic and diluted share  reported at december  return on average equity for the years  and was  and  respectively 
net interest margins increased to at december   from at december  and at december  financial condition assets total assets decreased  or million  during to million from million at december  the decline in assets is primarily due to the redirection of cash flows from both the investment portfolio and the residential mortgage portfolio into new commercial loans and the reduction in fhlb borrowings 
the strategy had the effect of lowering the bank s total assets but also improving both interest margins and net interest income 
total assets increased  or million  during to million from million at december  growth in assets was primarily due to increases in loans held for investment of million  net of unearned interest and allowance for loan losses  offset by reductions of million in investment securities 
average earning assets 
interest income from earning assets represents the company s main source of revenue 
average earning assets for the year ended december   totaled million  a million  or  decrease compared to december  the decrease was made up of a million  or  decrease in average investment securities primarily offset by a million  or  increase in average loans 
average earning assets for the period ended december   totaled million

total htm and afs investment securities fell by million  or  to million at december   from million at december  from to  total htm and afs investment securities fell by million  or  to million at december   from million at december  in both and  the flat yield curve discouraged reinvestment of proceeds from investments back into the market  consequently  cash flows from investments were used to fund new loan growth and reduce borrowings

when it appears to management that the company will have trouble recapturing all outstanding principal and or interest on a loan or loan relationship  the debt is placed on non accrual 
by placing loans on non accrual the company recognizes a problem credit  foregoes interest that is likely uncollectible  and adjusts the carried loan balance to reflect the collection amount expected 
when problem credits are transferred to non accrual status  the accrual of interest income is discontinued and all previously accrued and uncollected interest for the year is reversed against interest income 
a non accrual loan may be restored to accrual status when it is no longer delinquent and management no longer doubts the collectibility of interest and principal 
several key measures are used to evaluate and monitor the company s asset quality 
these measures include the levels and percentages of total nonperforming assets  loan delinquencies  non accrual loans  foreclosed assets and charge offs 
nonperforming assets  consisting of non accrual loans  loans past due days or more and other real estate owned  decreased thousand to million at december  compared to the balance at december  from december  to december   nonperforming assets increased thousand compared to the balance at december  non performing assets as a percent of average assets increased to

table of contents at december   overall credit quality remained stable 
the increase in the fourth quarter of in the net charge off percentages was due primarily to one commercial credit 
in the opinion of management  this credit will not materially affect the company s asset quality 
specific reserves have been set aside for the unsecured portion of the credit as well as any unforeseen shortfalls 
the company added a thousand provision for loan losses in the fourth quarter of to maintain the overall adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  which ended  and at

management does not believe that there are any other loans  or any other interest bearing asset  not already specifically reserved for  that the company has serious doubts as to the ability of the borrower to comply with the present repayment terms 
as of december   no other interest bearing assets held by the company are classified as non accrual or past due days or more 
the company continues to monitor securities issued by municipalities on the mississippi gulf coast  as reported in the company s q dated september  under item  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

table of contents allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established as losses are estimated through a provision for loan losses charged against operations and is maintained at a level that management considers adequate to absorb losses in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is subject to change as management re evaluates the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis 
management s judgment in determining the adequacy of the allowance is inherently subjective and is based on the evaluation of individual loans  the known and inherent risk characteristics and size of the loan portfolios  the assessment of current economic and real estate market conditions  estimates of the current value of underlying collateral  past loan loss experience  review of regulatory authority examination reports and evaluations of specific loans and other relevant factors 
the bank risk rates each loan at the initiation of the transaction and risk ratings are reviewed and changed  when necessary  during the life of the loan 
the allowance consists of specific  general and unallocated components 
the specific component relates to loans that are considered impaired 
loan loss reserve factors are multiplied against the balances in each risk rating category to arrive at the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses 
loans assigned higher risk ratings are monitored more closely by management 
the general component of the allowance for loan losses groups loans with similar characteristics and allocates a percentage based upon historical losses and the inherent risks within each category 
the unallocated portion of the allowance reflects management s estimate of probable but undetected losses inherent in the portfolio  such estimates are influenced by uncertainties in economic conditions  delays in obtaining information  including unfavorable information about a borrower s financial condition  difficulty in identifying triggering events that correlate to subsequent loss rates  and risk factors that have not yet manifested themselves in loss allocation factors 
the methodology for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is consistently applied  however  revisions may be made to the methodology and assumptions based on historical information related to charge off and recovery experience and management s evaluation of the current loan portfolio 
based upon this evaluation  management believes the allowance for loan losses of million at december   which represents 
of gross loans held to maturity  is more than adequate  under prevailing economic conditions  to absorb probable losses on existing loans 
at december   total reserves included specific reserves of thousand  general reserves of million and unallocated reserves of thousand 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  or  of gross loans held to maturity  which was composed of specific reserves of thousand  general reserves of million and unallocated reserves of thousand

the bank belongs to a network that allows access to national deposits and gathers these deposits as needed 
during  cash flows from the investment and mortgage portfolios were sufficient to satisfy the bank s liquidity needs  allowing the bank to forego gathering these national deposits until the yields required to be paid on such deposits decreased to a level where net interest income and interest margin would not be negatively impacted 
although the higher cost national deposits declined  the bank s core deposits actually grew by approximately million compared to included in the bank s liquidity plan is the use of brokered deposits as a means to fund and manage loan and deposit levels 
the bank purchased million in brokered funds in as a part of its liquidity and funding plan and to contain deposit costs as interest rates were rising 
these deposits remain in the portfolio at december   at rates considerably lower than market rates 
the original terms and rates of these deposits range from year to four years with an average cost of 
fees associated with the deposits are amortized over the life of the deposits 
to protect and grow the deposit portfolio  the bank intends to utilize certificate of deposit specials throughout these accounts in the past have been successful and have contributed toward the growth in interest bearing deposits 
during  the company joined the certificate of deposit account registry service cdars  an innovative new deposit placement service that helps banks attract and retain larger local deposits 
deposits in the cdars program are federally insured and are considered brokered 
these deposits have increased over the past three years to million at december   from million at december   and million at december  
table of contents maturities of certificates of deposits of  or more at december   and  are summarized below 
time remaining until maturity three months or less over three through six months over six through twelve months over twelve months deposits at december   and december   consist of the following non interest bearing demand deposits now accounts money market deposit accounts savings accounts certificates of deposit borrowings 
aside from the deposit base described above  the company utilizes short and long term borrowings as another funding source 
short term borrowings include overnight funding through established lines of credit with correspondent banks and the fhlb 
also included are short term advances maturing in one year or less from the fhlb  along with customer repurchase agreements 
the company s short term funding base decreased million to million at december   from million at december   due primarily to the use of cash flows from the bank s investment securities portfolio to pay down borrowings 
long term borrowings consist of advances from the fhlb with a maturity date greater than one year from the reporting period and junior subordinated debentures see note i  borrowings in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
these longer term funding sources also declined during to million at december   from million at december  because of increases in the company s deposits from to  the company utilized its short term funding sources less

in  cash flows from both the investment portfolio and the residential mortgage portfolio were directed into new commercial loans in the amount of million  fhlb borrowings were also reduced by a similar amount 
the flat to inverted yield curve experienced throughout afforded limited opportunity to reinvest cash flows from securities into additional securities 
cash flows that funded increases in commercial loans were mostly used in the baton rouge market 
the commercial loan growth and the pay downs in the residential loan portfolio combined to keep the aggregate dollar amount of the entire loan portfolio relatively unchanged for the year with additional cash flows used to reduce wholesale borrowings

table of contents liquidity liquidity is a measure of the company s ability to fund loan commitments and meet deposit maturities and withdrawals in a timely and cost effective manner 
these needs can be met by generating profits  attracting new deposits  converting assets including short term investments  mortgage loans held for sale and securities available for sale to cash through sales or securitizations  and increasing borrowings 
to minimize funding risks  management monitors liquidity monthly through reviews of basic surplus which includes investment securities available for pledging or borrowing offset by short term liabilities  along with projections of loan and deposits for the next days 
principal sources of liquidity  both short and long term  for the company are asset cash flows  customer deposits and the ability to borrow against investment securities and loans 
the company s cash and cash equivalents decreased from million at december   to million at december  cash provided by operating and investing activities during was and million  respectively  while million was devoted to financing activities in the company s cash and cash equivalents were million at december  in  the company experienced a decline in deposits 
nevertheless  in the company was able use cash flows from its investment securities to reduce the amount of short and long term borrowings from the fhlb and other short term federal funds lines with correspondent banks 
in addition to the company s deposit base  management believes that the current level of short term investments and the projected cash flows from earning assets and securities available for sale are more than adequate to meet the company s current liquidity needs 
additional sources of liquidity available to the company include the ability to issue additional retail brokered certificates of deposit and the ability to sell or securitize a portion of the company s residential first mortgage portfolio 
the company also has available federal funds lines and its membership in the fhlb to further augment liquidity by providing a readily accessible source of funds at competitive rates 
the company accepts funds from various local and state governments 
total public deposits at december   were million compared to million at december   and million at december  these deposits  considered non core  generally are accepted on a bid basis and tend to fluctuate from year to year

table of contents the company s liquidity and capital resources are substantially dependent on the ability of the bank to transfer funds to the company in the form of dividends  loans and advances 
under federal law  the directors of a national bank  after making proper deduction for all expenses and other deductions required by the comptroller of the currency  may credit net profits to the bank s undivided profits account  and may declare a dividend from that account of so much of the net profits as they judge expedient 
the comptroller and the federal reserve board have each indicated that banking organizations should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings 
the bank s ability to pay dividends is also limited by prudence  statutory and regulatory guidelines  and a variety of other factors 
further  in connection with the acquisition of natchez first federal in  the bank assumed a liquidation account of approximately million which has the effect of prohibiting the payment of dividends if the bank s net worth would thereby be reduced below the amount required for the liquidation account 
management does not anticipate that this restriction will have a material adverse effect on the bank s ability to pay dividends to the company 
certain restrictions exist on the ability of the bank to transfer such funds to the company in the form of loans 
federal reserve regulations limit the amount the bank may loan to the company unless such loans are collateralized by specific obligations 
at december   the maximum amount available for transfer from the bank to the company in the form of loans on a secured basis was million 
there were no loans outstanding from the bank to the company at december  the company s asset liability committee alco determines an appropriate level of capital and liquidity adequate to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers
