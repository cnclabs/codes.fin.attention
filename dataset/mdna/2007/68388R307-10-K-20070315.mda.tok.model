settlement services for these merchants are provided by third party processors on an outsourced basis 
our electronic wallet stored value consumer product offering is an electronic account for consumers that can be securely funded and can be spent at internet sites of merchants who have subscribed to our service 
this solution allows consumers to pay for products and services on the internet without having to divulge sensitive bank account information to merchants 
consumers receive transaction confirmations by e mail and can access their accounts any time they are connected to the internet 
we are currently considering additional consumer uses our electronic wallet 
to mitigate our risk exposure  we retain a portion of amounts owed to certain merchants based on processing dollar volume for a six month period to cover potential merchant credit losses  which can arise as a result of  among other things  disputes between consumers and merchants or credit card and check clearing association fines related to chargeback activity 
the aggregate amount withheld is referred to as held as reserves and our liability to refund our customers is included in the line item customer reserves and security deposits on the balance sheet contained in our consolidated financial statements 
in the case of a dispute between a merchant and its customer  if the dispute is not resolved in the merchant s favour  the disputed transaction amount is refunded to the merchant s customer and charged back to us 
if we are unable to collect a chargeback amount from the merchant  we bear the credit risk for this amount 
as a result  our acquiring processing suppliers require us to maintain certain amounts with them as reserves 
amounts withheld by our acquiring processing suppliers as reserves are included in cash and short term investments on our balance sheet as held as reserves 
for merchants who use our services  we withhold reserves to help offset our exposure to chargebacks 
the reserves are collected and refunded on a rolling basis 
as new transactions are processed  we withhold a portion as the reserve  while at the same time refunding previously withheld reserves for which the six month period has expired 
our competitive strengths the principal competitive strengths of our payment processing business are the strength of our proprietary risk management expertise 
our proprietary risk management expertise helps to reduce the inherently higher level of risk associated with processing credit card and electronic check payments received by internet or telephone 
our proprietary risk management tools and processes are designed to handle a wide variety of transactions  the performance profiles of which vary 
these transactions may originate from consumers authorization and purchase  merchants settlement and credit or internal users query 
the greatest proportion of these transactions is initiated by the consumer  since there are comparatively more consumers than there are merchants  and since merchant transactions relate to previously submitted consumer transactions 
with this knowledge  we have developed a unique proprietary transaction processor with an emphasis on the easy handling of customer submitted authorization and purchase transactions 
we maintain a proprietary transaction processing platform that we can tailor to meet the needs of our customers 
we have developed our own proprietary transaction processing technology  which has given us the flexibility to tailor our offerings to the needs of our merchants and internal users 
our network operations center is mission critical  fully redundant and benefits from automated network monitoring 
our transaction processing engine includes an internet merchant account  payment gateway  real time authorization  risk management and fraud protection  as well as back end reporting tools that help merchants manage their operations 
our electronic payment services can be integrated into a merchant s existing business systems 
we have invested significantly in our technology and we believe that the barriers to entry are high  particularly in the card not present processing industry 
we provide dedicated customer service 
our internal account management staff is focused on meeting the needs of our merchant customers 
our larger card not present customers are assigned an account manager  with a view to ensuring that merchants expectations are met or exceeded 
for card not present merchants  we understand the importance of uptime  therefore our account managers ensure their availability and timely responses to any merchant inquiries 
we offer merchants comprehensive payment processing solutions 
we are able to provide merchants with both card present and card not present processing options  risk management expertise  multi currency and multiple payment methods  specifically pertaining to card not present transactions  a proprietary processing technology platform  specifically pertaining to our card not present transactions  and a focus on customer care 
as we offer both card present and card not present payment processing solutions  we offer merchants the simplicity of having one supplier for both of these offerings  reducing their administrative burden of having multiple payment processing suppliers and helping to allow merchants to focus on their core business 
our electronic wallet is proprietary and proven 
our electronic wallet was developed in house and has been widely adopted by consumers 
consumers benefit from the flexibility provided our electronic wallet  as they are able to easily transfer funds to and from merchants 
merchants benefit from the risk management expertise inherent in the offering 
for merchants requiring a higher threshold of financial risk mitigation  we offer the electronic wallet on a guaranteed basis  under which the merchant does not absorb the costs of non recovery  such as for fraudulent transactions or other forms of consumer default  as they essentially outsource their risk management function to us 
our business strategy to continue to grow our payment processing business  our strategy is to provide merchants with the ability to process a variety of electronic transactions  including both card present and card not present credit and debit transactions  as well as electronic wallet transactions 
although we will offer a wide variety of electronic transaction solutions  we will focus our efforts and strategy on marketing and selling card not present transactions 
our experience in processing card not present transactions  specifically our technology and risk management expertise  positions us as a leader in these types of transactions 
key elements of our business strategy include continuing to strive to enhance our risk management capabilities and solutions for our merchant customers and for the consumer users of our electronic wallet  expanding our merchant customer base  expanding the currency options available in our solutions  expanding the consumer uses for our electronic wallet  and expanding the geographical availability of our solutions into new territories 
with our existing infrastructure and supplier relationships  we believe that we can accommodate expected industry growth 
we believe that our available capacity and infrastructure will allow us to take advantage of operational efficiencies as we grow our processing volume 
our customers our customers include merchants  as well as consumers who utilize our electronic wallet offering 
we provide services to over  small to medium sized merchants 
suppliers our key suppliers are our transaction processing suppliers  primarily financial institutions 
these financial institutions are members of the visa and mastercard credit card associations and check clearing associations  such as the national automated clearing house association 
these relationships provide us with the ability to connect to the various payment networks 
we have multiple relationships  enabling us to process various types of transactions in various geographic regions 
sales and marketing our sales efforts are initiated through direct sales  independent sales agents and strategic partnerships 
we employ an in house sales force whose focus is to sell our full range of services directly to merchants 
as part of our sales and marketing strategy  we have entered into numerous agreements with independent sales agents 
these agents refer merchants to us in return for a commission based on processing volume 
in addition  we utilize a distribution mechanism that relies on various strategic partnerships  alliances and leveraged distribution agreements 
the partnership agreements that we enter into are designed to attract larger numbers of merchants toward our offerings  with a view to growing our core transaction processing base and generating transaction fee revenues 
we generate revenues primarily from fees charged to merchants for processing services 
fees charged to merchants typically include a discount rate  based upon a percentage of the dollar amounts processed  and a variety of fixed transaction fees 
merchant fees are based upon the merchant s transaction volume and risk profile 
revenue is recognized at the time the transaction is performed 
where we are the primary party responsible for providing processing services  revenue is recorded on a gross basis and amounts paid to the acquiring processing supplier are recorded as part of our transaction processing expenses 
where we are not the primary party in providing a merchant with processing services  we record revenue net of amounts paid to the acquiring processing supplier 
we also derive revenue from fixed transaction fees charged to consumers who utilize our electronic wallet 
revenue is recognized at the time the transaction is performed 
research and development we recognize the importance of having access to leading technology in order to be able to develop advanced services for our customers  independent sales agents and for our own internal use 
to this end  we maintain a team of development engineers  quality assurance professionals and technical code writers 
as of december   approximately employees were engaged in such activities 
government regulation as electronic commerce in general and most of the card not present services that we offer are relatively new developments  the manner in which existing state  provincial  federal and foreign government regulations may be applied is uncertain and difficult to predict 
due to the relatively recent development of online gaming  there are few laws or regulations that deal directly with online gaming payment processing and there is uncertainty as to the legal status of online gaming 
while some jurisdictions have adopted or are in the process of reviewing legislation to regulate online gaming  other jurisdictions have enacted or propose to enact legislation in an attempt to restrict or prohibit online gaming 
on october   the united states unlawful internet gambling enforcement act of was enacted 
the act prohibits any person engaged in the business of betting or wagering from knowingly accepting payments related to unlawful bets or wagers transmitted over the internet 
the act instructs the us treasury department and federal reserve to impose new obligations upon financial institutions and other payment processors to establish procedures designed to block online gaming related financial transactions 
it also expressly requires internet bets and wagers to comply with the law of the jurisdiction where the wagers are initiated and received 
upon the passage of the act  fireone group ceased processing settlement transactions originating from united states customers that may be viewed as related to online gaming 
competition we believe that the payments markets are growing at a meaningful rate 
companies that either have developed or are developing product offerings in competition with us include ipayment inc  heartland payments systems  inc  paypal inc  telecheck international inc  transfirst holdings inc  datacash group plc and worldpay plc 
certain of our competitors are larger and have greater financial  technical and other resources than we do 
intellectual property we regard our software as proprietary and attempt to protect it  where applicable  with copyrights  trade secret measures and nondisclosure agreements 
despite these protections  it may be possible for competitors or users to copy aspects of our intellectual property or to obtain information that we regard as trade secrets 
existing copyright laws afford only limited practical protection for computer software 
the laws of foreign countries generally do not protect our proprietary rights in our services to the same extent as the laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate such as the united states  canada and the united kingdom 
in addition  we may experience more difficulty in enforcing our proprietary rights in certain foreign jurisdictions 
employees as of december   we employed approximately full time employees 
our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit and we have never experienced a work stoppage 
we believe that our employee relations are good

item a 
risk factors an investment in our common shares involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks 
the trading price of our common shares could decline due to any of these risks or other factors  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
the risks described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect us 
our business depends upon the services of key personnel 
our ability to successfully integrate acquisitions and to grow our business depends upon the services of a few key personnel  the loss of any of whom could adversely affect our business and overall results of operations 
the loss of key personnel or damage to their reputations could adversely affect our relationships with our strategic service providers  which would adversely affect our business 
we may be unable to find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to successfully integrate businesses we acquire into our operations 
our growth strategy might include acquiring other businesses 
however  we may not be able to identify and acquire targeted businesses or  to the extent required  obtain financing for such acquisitions on satisfactory terms 
integrating acquired businesses into our operations may also involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of resources and management attention 
acquisitions involve a number of special risks  including the time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating an acquisition  the diversion of management s attention from day to day operations  the difficulty in integrating widely dispersed operations with distinct corporate cultures  the potential loss of key employees of the acquired business  the difficulty of incorporating acquired technologies successfully  the potential impairment of relationships with employees  clients and strategic partners  and the inability to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies 
customer satisfaction or performance problems at a single acquired business could adversely affect the reputation of our entire business 
future acquisitions may be financed through the issuance of common shares  which may dilute the ownership of our shareholders  or through the incurrence of indebtedness 
acquisitions may also result in significant charges to earnings 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that competition for acquisition candidates will not escalate  thereby increasing the costs of making acquisitions or making suitable acquisitions more difficult to find 
we are subject to the risk that a taxation authority could challenge certain filing positions we have taken  and that a successful challenge could require us to pay significant additional taxes 
although we believe that all filing positions we take in our tax returns are reasonable and appropriate  there is no assurance that a taxation authority will not challenge those positions 
such challenges could include disputing positions taken in connection with the transfer of our online gaming processing business to fireone group in  and the subsequent public offering of a portion of the fireone group plc ordinary shares 
a challenge to certain filing positions we have taken  if successful despite our best efforts to defend our original position  could result in us being required to pay additional taxes including penalties and interest and the amount of such additional taxes could be material to us 
our payments businesses are at risk of loss due to fraud  disputes and merchant insolvency 
we face risks of loss due to fraud and disputes between consumers and merchants  including the unauthorized use of credit card and bank account information and identity theft  merchant fraud  disputes over the quality of goods and services  breaches of system security  employee fraud and use of our system for illegal or improper purposes 
when a consumer pays a merchant for goods or services using a credit card and the cardholder disputes the charge  the amount of the disputed item gets charged back to us and the credit card association may levy fees against us 
chargebacks may arise from the unauthorized use of a cardholder s card number or from a cardholder s claim that a merchant failed to perform 
disputes may also arise when a consumer pays a merchant for goods or services using a check and the financial institution returns the check 
in addition  if our chargeback or dispute rate becomes excessive  credit card and check clearing associations may require us to pay fines and have done so in the past 
there is a risk that we may be required to pay fines in the future and the amount of such fines may be material 
while we attempt to recover from the merchant the amount charged back and the amount of fines imposed upon us by credit card and check clearing associations  we may not always be successful in doing so for various reasons  such as merchant insolvency 
we may not be able to safeguard against security and privacy breaches in our electronic transactions 
a security or privacy breach could expose us to additional liability and to potentially costly litigation  increase expenses relating to the resolution of these breaches  deter customers from using our services  and decrease market acceptance of electronic commerce transactions generally 
we cannot assure that the use of applications designed for data security and integrity will address changing technologies or the security and privacy concerns of existing and potential customers 
although we require that our agreements with service providers who have access to merchant and consumer data include confidentiality obligations that restrict these parties from using or disclosing any consumer or merchant data except as necessary to perform their services under the applicable agreements  there can be no assurance that these contractual measures will prevent the unauthorized disclosure of merchant or consumer data 
if we are unable to protect the security and privacy of our electronic transactions and data  our business volume and profitability will be materially adversely affected 
our payments systems might be used for illegal or improper purposes 
despite our measures to detect and prevent identity theft  unauthorized used of credit cards  and similar misconduct  and to monitor and comply with laws and regulations restricting or prohibiting the business lines of our merchant customers  our payments systems remain susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses 
these uses may include illegal online gaming  fraudulent sales of goods or services  illicit sales of prescription medications or controlled substances  software and other intellectual property piracy  money laundering  bank fraud  child pornography trafficking  prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages and tobacco products and online securities fraud 
illegal or improper use of our payments systems may lead to increased government regulation of us or other legal consequences which may have an adverse impact on our operations and profitability 
laws or regulations that restrict or prohibit the business activities of our merchant customers may prevent us from providing  or may make it impracticable for us to continue to provide  our payments systems to such merchants and their customers  which would adversely affect our revenues from our payments processing segment 
in particular  the legal and regulatory environment surrounding the online sale and distribution of prescription medications into and within the united states is complex and evolving  and we continue to closely monitor the impact that developments in this area may have on our ability to continue to provide payment processing services for this sector 
legal and regulatory developments that have an adverse impact on these transactions may significantly reduce or eliminate the payment processing revenues that we generate from pharmacies offering sale of prescription medications online and their customers 
we must comply with credit card and check clearing association rules and practices  which could impose additional costs and burdens on our payments businesses 
as a registered party  we must comply with the operating rules of various credit card associations and check clearing associations  such as the national automated clearing house association for checks 
the associations members set these rules 
the associations could adopt operating rules with which it may be difficult or impossible for us to comply 
in addition  cases of fraud or disputes between consumers and merchants can result in chargebacks 
if our chargebacks or disputes become excessive  our processing suppliers could fine us or terminate our ability to accept credit cards or checks for payments 
the termination of our relationship with credit card or check clearing associations  or acquiring banks  would limit our ability to provide transaction processing services 
we may not be able to develop new services that are accepted by our customers 
the success of our electronic payments operations depends upon acceptance of our technology 
it is possible that we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of new services and enhancements  or that our new services and enhancements will not be introduced in a timely fashion or will not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance 
the failure of our systems  the systems of third parties or the internet could negatively impact our business systems and harm our reputation for reliability 
computer viruses  disgruntled or rogue employees  electronic break ins  power losses  telecommunications failures  security breaches  natural disasters and similar events could damage or disrupt the function of our systems and those of third parties upon whom we rely  such as bank processing and credit card systems 
our businesses and reputation could be adversely affected if these systems were disabled by any of these occurrences 
our existing or future insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that may occur due to any failures or interruptions in these systems 
higher transaction volumes may require us to expand and upgrade our technology  transaction processing systems and network infrastructure 
we could experience periodic  temporary capacity constraints  which may cause unanticipated system disruptions  slower response times and lower levels of customer service 
we may be unable to accurately project the rate or timing of increases  if any  in the use of our services or to expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate these increases in a timely manner 
users of electronic payment services are particularly concerned about the security of transmissions over public networks 
individuals may attempt to circumvent the measures that we take to protect customer transaction data 
security breaches that result in the disclosure of proprietary information  such as bank account or credit card information  could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss  litigation and possible liability 
in order to prepare for certain types of system problems  our payments business has developed a formal disaster recovery plan  however  there is no assurance that any disaster recovery plan that we might implement will protect us from all possible system failures 
increasing government regulation of internet commerce could make it more costly or difficult to conduct our businesses 
as internet commerce continues to develop  it may become the subject of increasing government regulation 
much of the current legislation relating to commercial transactions pre dates and may be incompatible with internet electronic commerce 
well established financial institutions and credit card companies may be able to influence the development of regulations that prioritize their interests to our detriment 
regulators may choose to enact or enforce legislation that restricts our operations and other aspects of the electronic commerce market 
moreover  it may take years to determine the extent to which existing laws relating to issues such as intellectual property ownership and infringement  libel and personal privacy apply to the internet 
existing legislation in canada  the united states and abroad regulates communications or commerce specifically 
however  the application of such laws in the context of the internet and electronic commerce is uncertain 
laws and regulations that address issues such as user privacy  pricing  online content regulation  taxation and the characteristics and quality of online services are under consideration by federal  provincial  state  local and foreign governments and agencies 
new laws or regulations relating to the internet  or applications or interpretations of existing laws  that decrease the growth in the use of the internet or demand for our electronic commerce services  or that increase the costs associated with providing such services or transmitting data over the internet could adversely affect our results of operations 
if our relationships with our banking partners deteriorated  our ability to process transactions could be impaired or halted 
we rely on strategic partnerships and suppliers to help supply  promote and distribute our services 
we particularly depend upon our strategic banking relationships 
the credit card association members and financial institutions that process our electronic transactions have adopted guidelines that apply to these and online gaming transactions 
while we believe that our operations comply with these guidelines  credit card association members and financial institutions could nonetheless decide in the future to refuse to process transactions for us  or with respect to fireone group  to process online gaming transactions generally 
such a decision could be implemented with little or no advance notice to us 
if such a situation occurred and we were not able to conclude alternative arrangements with other credit card association members or financial institutions  our ability to carry out payment transactions could be impaired or even halted 
it may be difficult or costly to enforce our rights with respect to assets held in foreign jurisdictions 
certain of our suppliers processing agreements require us to maintain cash reserves with such suppliers 
in some instances  these suppliers are located in overseas jurisdictions  including the caribbean and europe 
if a processing supplier does not release our reserves in accordance with its contractual obligations  we will be required to take legal action within that foreign jurisdiction 
recovering funds held as reserves through legal action in foreign jurisdictions could be costly and difficult and the diversion of resources required to pursue the funds could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 
our intellectual property rights may be infringed by unauthorized third parties 
we rely upon a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  non disclosure and release of interest in intellectual property agreements and license agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our service offerings and technology 
the source codes for our service offerings and technology are protected both as trade secrets and as unpublished  unregistered copyrighted works 
however  we currently have no patents for our service offerings and technology 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our services or technology without authorization or to develop similar technology independently 
policing unauthorized use of our services is and will continue to be difficult  particularly in light of the global nature of our operations  and the laws of other jurisdictions may offer us little or no effective protection of our intellectual property rights 
we rely in part on on screen licenses  which are not manually signed by end users and  therefore  may be unenforceable under some laws 
we may bring litigation proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights  however  such litigation  whether successful or unsuccessful  could result in substantial costs and the diversion of resources 
in addition  there is no assurance that our services are not within the scope of intellectual property rights held by others  either now or in the future 
if a claim is asserted against us by a third party  we may be forced to seek a license from that third party for the use of the applicable intellectual property 
such a license  if required  may not be available on reasonable terms or at all 
we operate in a competitive market for our services 
our potential competitors in our payments business include credit card association members  financial institutions  payment processors and other entities  some of which may have greater financial resources than we do  more firmly entrenched market positions or greater brand recognition 
these potential competitors may require that their own technology  rather than the technology of third parties such as us  be used in connection with their payment mechanisms 
competition is likely to intensify as our market develops and matures  which could result in downward pressure on our prices  reduce our margins and erode our market share 
we may not be able to identify  develop  manufacture  market or support new services or offer new services that appeal to our customers as fast as our competitors will or that will respond effectively to technological changes or product innovations by our competitors 
if we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to technological developments and customer requirements or experience significant delays in product developments or roll outs  we may lose our market share and our revenues could be adversely affected 
we rely upon non exclusive arrangements with independent sales agents to acquire and retain our customers 
in addition to our internal sales and marketing efforts  we rely upon independent sales agents to acquire and retain our customers 
our arrangements with these independent sales agents are non exclusive 
our sales agents may enter into arrangements with our competitors that provide preferential treatment to our competitors or they may terminate their arrangements with us 
if we fail to maintain strong relationships with our independent sales agents or fail to provide our independent sales agents with sufficient incentives to motivate their sales efforts  our customer base may not expand 
our services are based on sophisticated technology  which may be negatively affected by technological defects and product development delays 
services based on sophisticated technology and computing systems often encounter development delays  and the underlying technology may contain undetected errors or failures when introduced or when the volume of services provided increases 
we may experience delays in the development of our services or the technology and computing systems underlying our services  such as our transaction processing services 
in addition  despite testing  it is possible that our technology may nevertheless contain errors  and this could delay product launches and innovations and damage our customer relations 
if our encryption technology fails to ensure secure electronic commerce transactions  we may become subject to liabilities and our customers may stop using our services 
a significant element of electronic commerce and communication is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
our electronic commerce software uses encryption and authentication technology to effect the secure transmission of confidential information 
although we strive to use only proven applications for premium data security and integrity to process electronic transactions  there can be no assurance that use of these applications will be sufficient to address changing market conditions or developments in technology or the security and privacy concerns of our existing and potential clients 
a security or privacy breach may cause our clients to lose confidence in our services  deter clients from using our services  harm our reputation  expose us to liability  increase our expenses from potential remediation costs and decrease market acceptance and growth of our product offerings 
we are subject to exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and the canadian dollar 
the majority of our revenues are generated in us dollars and a significant portion of our expenses is incurred in canadian dollars 
a fluctuation in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar may result in variations in our revenues and earnings 
we have not implemented a currency hedging program 
our businesses are subject to fluctuations in general business conditions 
general economic conditions have caused some of the merchants we serve to experience difficulty in supporting their current operations and implementing their business plans 
if these merchants make fewer sales of their products and services  we will have fewer transactions to process  resulting in lower revenues 
in addition  in a recessionary environment  the merchants we serve could be subject to a higher rate of insolvency  which could adversely affect us financially 
we bear credit risk for chargebacks related to billing disputes between credit card holders and merchants 
if a merchant seeks relief under bankruptcy laws or is otherwise unable or unwilling to pay  we may be liable for the full transaction amount of a chargeback 
due to recently enacted legislation in the united states  fireone group has ceased processing settlements for online gaming transactions originating from united states customers and  as a result  our revenues will decrease significantly and our business and results of operations will be materially adversely affected during at least the short term 
we may not be able to replace the revenues lost from the cessation of this business 
on october   the united states unlawful internet gambling enforcement act of was enacted 
the act prohibits any person engaged in the business of betting or wagering from knowingly accepting payments related to unlawful bets or wagers transmitted over the internet 
the act also instructs the us treasury department and federal reserve to impose new obligations upon financial institutions and other payment processors to establish procedures designed to block online gaming related financial transactions 
it also expressly requires internet bets and wagers to comply with the law of the jurisdiction where the wagers are initiated and received 
upon passage of the act  fireone group ceased processing settlement transactions originating from united states customers that may be viewed as related to online gaming 
the cessation of this portion of fireone group s business has had  for the third and fourth quarters  and will continue to have for at least the short term  a material adverse effect on our revenues and our results of operations 
we intend to actively pursue opportunities to replace the revenues that were lost due to fireone group s cessation of processing transactions originating from us consumers 
however  we may not be able to identify and engage in other opportunities that will offset the loss of these revenues 
the legal status of online gaming is uncertain in some of the jurisdictions in which we continue to provide settlement processing services for online gaming activities 
future regulation or enforcement proceedings may make it costly or impossible for us to continue processing transactions for gaming merchants in those jurisdictions and may subject us to substantial penalties 
reports of regulatory initiatives or enforcement proceedings that are unfavorable to us or to our customers or suppliers may adversely affect the trading price of our common shares 
in many jurisdictions there are few  if any  laws or regulations that deal directly with payment processing for online gaming transactions 
the legal status of online gaming itself is uncertain in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
while some jurisdictions have taken the position that online gaming is legal and have adopted or are in the process of reviewing legislation to regulate online gaming  other jurisdictions have taken the opposite view and enacted legislation to attempt to restrict or prohibit online gaming 
for example  the recently enacted united states unlawful gambling enforcement act of prohibits any person engaged in the business of betting or wagering from knowingly accepting payments related to unlawful bets or wagers transmitted over the internet  which resulted in fireone group ceasing to process settlement transactions originating from united states customers that may be viewed as related to online gaming 
fireone group s exit from this business in the united states has had a substantial negative effect on our consolidated revenues and results of operations in the third and fourth quarters of and will have a significant impact on our results for at least the short term 
if other governments also decide to enact legislation restricting or prohibiting online gaming activities in their jurisdictions  we may also have to cease processing settlement transactions in those jurisdictions 
in addition  we may be exposed to adverse consequences as a result of future enforcement proceedings  governmental investigations or lawsuits initiated against us in jurisdictions where online gaming is or becomes restricted or prohibited  including the united states in the aftermath of the unlawful internet gambling enforcement act of any adverse findings  rulings or judgments rendered against us could involve substantial penalties  fines  injunctions or other sanctions being invoked against us and have a material adverse effect on our business  revenues  operating results and financial condition 
any future enforcement or legal proceedings threatened or commenced against us relating to online gaming  whether or not ultimately successful  could involve substantial litigation expense and the diversion of the attention of key executives 
the outcome of any litigation cannot be predicted 
future regulation  lawsuits  investigations  enforcement actions or other actions by law enforcement or regulatory authorities  whether directed against us  our competitors  customers or suppliers  may also make it costly or unfeasible for us to continue processing transactions for gaming merchants in the jurisdictions in which we continue such processing activities 
further  any actual or threatened legislative development or regulatory proceedings in those jurisdictions that negatively affects a participant in the online gaming industry could further adversely affect the trading price of our common shares 
from time to time  reports about regulatory initiatives  or enforcement proceedings that are or would be unfavorable to us  or to our customers or suppliers  have had a swift and negative impact on the trading price of our common shares  and our common shares may again experience trading price volatility in the future due to such reports 
our status under certain financial services regulations is unclear 
we operate in an industry subject to government regulation 
we currently are subject to money laundering regulations and might now or in the future be subject to money transmitter or electronic money regulations  in various jurisdictions 
if we are found to be in violation of any current or future regulations  we could be exposed to financial liability  including substantial fines which could be imposed on a per transaction basis and disgorgement of our profits  forced to change our business practices  or forced to cease doing business altogether or with the residents of one or more jurisdictions 
we bear consumer risk in relation to our guaranteed electronic wallet and direct debit offerings 
we offer our electronic wallet and direct debit services to our merchant customers on a guaranteed and a non guaranteed basis 
merchants have the option of electing to receive funds from consumers which are free of any risk of consumer default 
there can be no assurance that our risk management process will enable us to price our guaranteed service on terms that are favorable to us 
our failure to price the guaranteed service accurately could have a material adverse effect on our financial results because we guarantee the consumer s payment 
we may be subject to additional litigation stemming from our operation of the u scan self checkout business 
in  we settled an action alleging that the u scan self checkout systems that we marketed infringed upon the claimant s patent 
a second party has sent demand letters to us alleging a different patent infringement 
we may in the future be subject to other litigation relating to our prior involvement in the self checkout business 
defending against such litigation may be time consuming  expensive and distracting from the conduct of our current businesses  and the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict 
the adverse resolution of any specific lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition

item legal proceedings legal proceedings we received demand letters in and in february from a party alleging a patent infringement related to the u scan self checkout business that we operated at that time 
in march  the same party sent a third demand letter to us alleging infringement of additional patents 
although  after consultation with counsel  we believe that this claimant should not prevail if a lawsuit is brought to assert its claims and that the assertion of these claims will not have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects  no assurance can be given that a court will not find that the claimant s patent rights were infringed 
although we sold our self checkout business on april  to fujitsu  and no longer market or sell the u scan self checkout system  we remain responsible for this claim 
in march and june  we received letters from fujitsu claiming recovery of expenses allegedly incurred and forecast by fujitsu to be incurred in relation to the operation of our former u scan self checkout business 
in december  we were notified by fujitsu of its intention to arbitrate its claims 
in february  fujitsu initiated arbitration proceedings 
after consultation with counsel  we believe that there is no basis for these claims and intend to vigorously defend our position 
we are also party to litigation arising in the normal course of operations 
we do not expect the resolution of such matters to have a materially adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with canadian gaap  with reconciliation to us gaap  as disclosed in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
overview we are a leading payments company with operations primarily in north america and the united kingdom 
during we operated in three segments through optimal payments a segment comprised of optimal payments inc and its subsidiaries  we processed credit card payments for small and medium sized internet businesses  mail order telephone order merchants and retail point of sale merchants  and processed electronic checks and direct debits online and by telephone  through fireone group a segment comprised of our then majority owned subsidiary fireone group plc and its subsidiaries  we processed online gaming transactions through the use of credit and debit cards  electronic debit and electronic wallet  and through optimal services group inc we carried on our hardware maintenance and repair business 
as a result of our decision in the first quarter of to divest the hardware maintenance and repair business  this segment has been presented as discontinued operations on our consolidated financial statements see note b of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
on october  fireone group ceased processing settlement transactions originating from united states customers that may be viewed as related to online gaming  and as a result we will operate and report our payment processing business as a combined segment commencing in january in and  we completed a number of acquisitions and dispositions in pursuit of our strategy to reposition our business activities and enhance our financial results 
these transactions were designed to realign our company into a leading payments company with a more balanced and stable business mix 
we plan to continue to grow our core payments business on a strategic basis 
we are also actively seeking out strategic and transactional opportunities 
on december   in order to repatriate and realign certain assets  we announced our intention to make an offer for all of the issued and outstanding shares in the capital of fireone group plc held by non controlling shareholders  which represented approximately of fireone group plc s share capital 
we completed this offer on february on october   the united states unlawful internet gambling enforcement act of was enacted 
upon the passage of the act  fireone group immediately ceased processing settlement transactions originating from united states customers that may be viewed as related to online gaming 
these transactions represented approximately of fireone group s total payment processing services revenue for the year ended december  the cessation of this portion of fireone group s business has had  for the third and fourth quarters  and will continue to have for at least the short term  a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 
on september   we sold substantially all of the assets and the business of our hardware maintenance and repair services business segment  operated by optimal services group inc  which resulted in a loss of million and is presented as loss on disposal of net assets from discontinued operations on our consolidated financial statements 
the net operating loss of optimal services group inc is being treated as loss from discontinued operations  on our consolidated financial statements see note b of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
payment processing our payment processing business provides technology and services that businesses require to accept credit card  electronic check and direct debit payments 
we process credit card payments for card not present and card present transactions  including internet businesses  mail order telephone order merchants  and retail point of sale merchants 
we also process checks and direct debits online and by telephone 
our payments business generates revenues primarily from fees charged to merchants for processing services  as well as from fees charged to consumers who use our electronic wallet 
fees charged to merchants typically include a discount rate  based upon a percentage of the dollar amounts processed  and a variety of fixed transaction fees 
merchant fees charged are based upon the merchant s transaction volume and risk profile 
generally  higher discount rates are charged for card not present transactions than for card present transactions in order to compensate for the higher cost of underwriting and managing the increased chargeback risk associated with these transactions 
other fees are derived from a variety of fixed transaction fees  including fees for monthly minimum charge volume requirements  statement fees  annual fees and fees for other miscellaneous items  such as handling chargebacks 
fees charged to electronic wallet consumers are based on a fixed amount per transaction 
revenue is recognized primarily at the time the transaction is performed 
where we are the primary party responsible for providing processing services  revenue is recorded on a gross basis and amounts paid to the acquiring processing supplier are recorded as part of our transaction processing expenses 
where we are not the primary party in providing a merchant with processing services  we record revenue net of amounts paid to the acquiring processing supplier 
see note l of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
disputes between a customer and a merchant periodically arise as a result of  among other things  consumer dissatisfaction with merchandise quality or merchant services 
such disputes may not always be resolved in the merchant s favor 
if a dispute is not resolved in the merchant s favor  the transaction is charged back to us and the purchase price is refunded to the merchant s customer 
if we are unable to collect the amount charged back from the merchant  we bear the credit risk for the full amount of the transaction 
as a result  our acquiring processing suppliers require us to maintain certain amounts with them as reserves 
amounts withheld from us by our acquiring processing suppliers as reserves are included as current assets on our balance sheet under held as reserves 
we retain a percentage of amounts owed to certain merchants based on processing dollar volume  typically for a six month period  to absorb potential losses arising as a result of  among other things  disputes between consumers and merchants or credit card or check clearing association fines related to chargeback activity 
these reserves comprise specifically identifiable reserves for merchant transactions for which losses can be estimated and an estimate of loss in the remaining portfolio based on experience 
the aggregate amount withheld is referred to as held as reserves and the amount that we must eventually pay our customers in respect of remaining reserves is recorded under the line item customer reserves and security deposits on the balance sheet contained in our consolidated financial statements 
significant developments in our business in on december   in order to repatriate and realign certain assets  we announced our intention to make an offer for all of the issued and outstanding shares in the capital of fireone group plc held by non controlling shareholders  which represented approximately of fireone group plc s share capital 
we completed this offer on february on october   the united states unlawful internet gambling enforcement act of act was enacted 
upon the passage of the act  fireone group immediately ceased processing settlement transactions originating from united states customers that may be viewed as related to online gaming 
these transactions represented approximately of fireone group s total payment processing services revenue for the year ended december  the cessation of this portion of fireone group s business has had  for the third and fourth quarters  and will continue to have for at least the short term  a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 
as a result of this event  we will operate and report our payment processing business as a combined segment commencing in january on september   we sold substantially all of the assets and the business of our hardware maintenance and repair services business segment  operated by optimal services group inc  which resulted in a loss of million and is presented as loss on disposal of net assets from discontinued operations on our consolidated financial statements 
the net operating loss of optimal services group inc is being treated as loss from discontinued operations on our consolidated financial statements see note b of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
seasonality revenue derived from the payments business segments has some seasonality 
the second and third quarter revenues tend to be weaker as consumers tend to spend less during summer months 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with canadian gaap 
in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we are required to make numerous estimates and assumptions 
financial results as determined by actual events could differ from those estimates and assumptions  and therefore affect our reported results of operations and financial position 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the critical accounting policies described here are those that are most important to the depiction of our financial condition and results of operations 
the preparation of financial statements also involves significant management judgment in making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
while best estimates have been used for reporting financial statement items subject to measurement uncertainty  management considers that it is possible  based on existing knowledge  that changes in future conditions in the near term could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
near term is considered to be within one year from the date of financial statements 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value based method to account for stock based compensation and other stock based payments  such as stock options and restricted share units 
under the fair value based method  compensation cost is measured at fair value at the date of grant and is expensed over the award s vesting period 
the fair value of stock options granted is determined at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires certain assumptions  including future stock price volatility  risk from interest rates  and expected time to exercise 
changes to any of these assumptions  or the use of a different option pricing model  would result in different fair values for stock based compensation 
on november   our board of directors approved the accelerated vesting of all unvested stock options outstanding under our stock option plan 
as a result of the accelerated vesting  and the concurrent accelerated vesting by fireone group plc of all unvested restricted share units outstanding under its restricted share unit plan  we recorded stock based compensation of approximately million in the fourth quarter of in  we issued stock options  and fireone group plc issued restricted share units  which resulted in stock based compensation of million million  and is a non cash expense 
reserve for losses on merchant accounts when a consumer pays a merchant for goods or services online and the consumer subsequently disputes the online transaction  the amount of the disputed item gets charged back to us and the credit card or clearing bank association may levy a fee against us 
in addition  if our chargeback rate becomes excessive  the associations can also require us to pay fines 
in turn  we attempt to recover from the merchant the amount charged back and the amount of such fines 
however  we may not always be successful in doing so  for reasons which could include merchant insolvency 
we evaluate the risk associated with merchants and consumers and estimate our loss based primarily on historical experience and other relevant factors 
goodwill and other intangibles goodwill is not amortized but rather evaluated under an impairment approach 
other intangible assets with finite lives continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the amounts recorded as intangible assets at the date of acquisition represent the estimated fair value of these assets based on estimated future cash flows discounted at appropriate discount rates 
in addition  in our assessment of impairment  we are required to determine the fair value of the businesses acquired from which the goodwill and intangibles originated 
for intangibles with finite lives  we make estimates of future cash flows to be generated from the related assets 
income taxes we provide for income taxes using the asset and liability method of tax allocation 
under this method  future income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on deductible or taxable temporary differences between financial statement values and tax values of assets and liabilities using substantively enacted income tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we establish a valuation allowance against future income tax assets if  based on available information  it is more likely than not that some or all of the future income tax assets will not be realized 
in assessing the reliability of tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of the future tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible 
we considered the scheduled reversal of tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
discontinued operations at the end of the first quarter of  we decided to divest the hardware maintenance and repair services business segment 
the financial position of this segment has been segregated for the current and comparative periods as discontinued operations 
on september   we divested this business segment and the net operating loss of optimal services group inc is being treated as loss from discontinued operations  on our consolidated financial statements see note b of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
contingent liabilities our gaming payment processing services segment derived a substantial portion of its revenue prior to october  from processing transactions from us based gaming 
therefore  we may be exposed to adverse consequences as a result of enforcement proceedings  governmental investigations or lawsuits initiated against us in jurisdictions where gaming is or becomes restricted or prohibited 
in the event that the united states government initiates enforcement proceedings  or that any adverse findings  rulings or judgments are rendered in any such investigations or lawsuits directed at us or at our customers or suppliers  it may have a significant negative impact on the operations of our business 
at the present time  we are not aware of any enforcement proceedings  governmental investigations or lawsuit initiated against it in relation to the processing of online gaming transactions 
we are also party to litigation arising in the normal course of operations 
the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty 
should we fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several legal matters be resolved against us in the same reporting period  the consolidated operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected 
recent accounting pronouncements the following accounting standards have recently been issued by the canadian institute of chartered accountants cica  and the financial accounting standard board fasb that are relevant to our company 
financial instruments on january   we adopted cica handbook section  comprehensive income  cica handbook section  equity  cica handbook section  financial instruments recognition and measurement  cica handbook section  financial instruments disclosures and cica handbook  hedges 
we do not expect the adoption of these standards to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
accounting changes cica handbook section  accounting changes  modifies certain aspects of the standard it replaces 
a reporting entity may not change its accounting method unless required by a minimum source of gaap or to provide a more reliable and relevant presentation of the financial statements 
in addition  change in accounting methods must be applied retroactively and additional information must be disclosed 
the section is applicable for our fiscal year beginning january  we are not currently contemplating any voluntary changes in accounting policies 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements 
the interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
this fasb interpretation is effective for our company beginning january  we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this new standard on our consolidated financial statements as it relates to our canadian us gaap reconciliation note 
fair value measurements in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
under the standard  fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years  with early adoption permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
financial condition as at december   cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and settlement assets totaled million including million held as reserves  compared to million as at december  including million held as reserves 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments is primarily due to a decrease in cash generated from operations  the purchase of capital assets  the payment of dividends by fireone group plc  and an increase in amount of shares repurchased during the year 
as described above  a significant portion of cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments have a corresponding liability as these cash amounts are derived from reserves and security deposits which are due to customers see overview payment processing 
settlement assets result from timing differences in the settlement process of our payments segment 
settlement assets are typically funded to us within days from the transaction processing date 
as at year end  our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and settlement assets positions  net of bank indebtedness and customer reserves and security deposits  were as follows us dollars  in thousands cash and cash equivalents cash held as reserves short term investments short term investments held as reserves settlement assets less bank indebtedness customer reserves and security deposits net our portfolio of liquid and investment grade short term investments consists of us denominated discounted and undiscounted notes and bonds 
working capital  excluding cash and short term investments held as reserves  as at december  was million  as compared to million at december  this increase is primarily due to a reduction in customer reserves and security deposits in fireone group  due to a reduction in transaction processing volume resulting from the enactment of the act  and increased cash flow from operations for the period up to the date of the enactment of the act 
accounts receivable as at december  was million compared to million at december  the increase of million resulted primarily from the timing of the collection of certain transaction processing revenues 
goodwill and other intangible assets decreased by million  from million as at december  to million as at december  this decrease is due to amortization of million  an impairment loss of million see results of operations compared to  and acquisitions of intangible assets of million 
customer reserves and security deposits as at december  were million compared to million as at december  customer reserves and security deposits were million million for optimal payments and million million for fireone group business segments 
this decrease is due mainly to a reduction in transaction processing volume in fireone group  resulting from the enactment of the act 
shareholders equity as at december  was million as compared to million as at december  the increase is attributable primarily to our net earnings for the period  as well as the issuance of share capital resulting from the exercise of stock options and warrants  and the repurchase of our common shares see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements

as a result of the enactment of the act  fireone group immediately ceased processing settlement transactions originating from united states customers that may be viewed as related to online gaming 
the cessation of this portion of fireone group s business has had  for the third and fourth quarters  and will continue to have for at least the short term  a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 
compared with revenues increased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in revenues is due primarily to organic growth  as well as the following acquisitions which were completed during fiscal on may   optimal payments acquired a portfolio of merchant processing from united bank card  inc  and on october   optimal payments acquired a portfolio of us merchant processing contracts and associated sales channel contracts from moneris solutions  inc revenues for the year ended december  include revenues from the optimal payments business segment amounting to million including million of revenue charged to fireone group pursuant to an inter company services agreement and revenues from the fireone group business segment of million 
revenues for the year ended december  include revenues from the optimal payments business segment of million including inter company charges of million and revenues from the fireone group business segment of million

stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  decreased by million  from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the decrease in stock based compensation results primarily from our decision taken on november  to accelerate the vesting of all unvested stock options outstanding under our stock option plan and the concurrent decision of fireone group plc to accelerate the vesting of all unvested restricted share units outstanding under its restricted share unit plan see note b ii of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the stock based compensation for is associated with the issuance of additional stock options under our stock option plan  and the issuance of additional restricted share units by fireone group plc under its restricted share unit plan 
research and development expenses increased by million  from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  research and development expenses are comprised primarily of personnel related expenditures associated with the development of new solutions and the enhancement of existing offerings 
operating lease expenses increased by million  from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  restructuring costs of million were incurred during the year ended december  these costs related primarily to employee termination benefits and costs of leased premises no longer utilized  as a result of a restructuring of operations and cost base undertaken following the enactment of the act 
restructuring costs of million were recorded in fiscal  which related primarily to the departure of our president and chief operating officer 
amortization of property and equipment increased by million  from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  as a result of the enactment of the act and the resulting significant negative impact on the fireone group business  we performed our impairment testing for long lived assets and goodwill  and as a result  an impairment loss of million related to customer relationships was recognized

the decrease in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments is primarily due to a decrease in cash generated from operations  the payment of dividends by fireone group plc and the increase in amount of shares repurchased during the year

settlement assets result from timing differences in the settlement process of our payments segment 
settlement assets are typically funded to us within days from the transaction processing date 
as at december   our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and settlement assets positions  net of bank indebtedness and customer reserves and security deposits  were million see financial condition above 
operating activities generated million of cash and cash equivalents in  as compared to having generated million in this decrease is due mainly to a reduction in customer reserves in fireone group  as a result of decreased volume resulting from the enactment of the act  partially offset by increased cash generated from operations up to the enactment of the act

in  we received proceeds of million on the exercise of stock options and warrants  repaid million of the bank indebtedness  and repurchased common shares for million 
investing activities generated million in  compared with cash used of million in the increase in cash generated of million can be explained primarily by the following increases in  million more cash was generated on the maturity of short term investments million compared to million in in  million cash was used for acquisitions

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity table december  carrying fair value value thousands of us dollars notes denominated in us dollars  with a weighted average effective yield of  maturing between january  and april  held as reserves notes denominated in us dollars  with a weighted average effective yield of  maturing between january  and june  total fair value has been determined based upon quoted market values as at december  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulting from certain expenses paid from canadian operations in canadian dollars  while a significant portion of our revenues are earned in us dollars 
if the canadian dollar strengthens in relation to the us dollar  the effective cost of our expenses as reported in us dollars will increase 
we have never tried to hedge our exchange rate risk  do not plan to do so and may not be successful should we attempt to do so in the future 
we are also exposed to interest rate fluctuation risk  which we do not systematically manage 
we presently invest in short term investment grade paper
