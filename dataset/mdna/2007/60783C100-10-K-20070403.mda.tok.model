item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview modtech manufactures and sells modular relocatable classrooms and commercial and light industrial modular buildings 
we are a leading provider of modular classrooms in california and florida and a significant provider of commercial and light industrial modular buildings in california  florida  arizona  nevada and other neighboring states 
in california and florida  we market and sell our modular classrooms to school districts 
virtually all of our classroom sales are dependent upon public funding 
such funding is sourced in multiple ways which are strongly influenced by educational policies that are subject to political concerns 
the modular re locatable classroom industry is highly competitive with the market divided among a number of privately owned companies whose share of the market is smaller than ours 
the nonresidential modular building industry is highly competitive and fragmented 
it is composed primarily of regionally based private companies  each with a single manufacturing facility 
a total of approximately million in change orders on six school projects in california are included in both revenue and cost of sales for a total of approximately million in change orders on the heritage high school project in northern california are included in both revenue and cost of sales for these change orders represent incremental work that was outside the original contract 
the contract calls for this work to be completed and the change orders submitted for approval and payment after the completion of the work 
we complied with this requirement 
although the change orders remain unapproved  we believe it is probable that these costs will be recovered 
in the first quarter of we closed our glen rose  texas manufacturing facility 
we moved much of our texas inventory and fixed assets to our other factories 
our lease on the texas factory expires in january monthly rent on this lease is  we own the land and building related to our steel shop in texas  which is adjacent to the glen rose facility 
we anticipate we will be able to sell the steel shop during for the million approximate book value of the assets 
we did not incur any material costs associated with exit or disposal activities related to the closure of the glen rose facility 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentages of net sales represented by certain items in our statements of operations 
percent of net sales year ended december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit loss selling  general and administrative expenses impairment loss on goodwill gain on sale of property and equipment covenant amortization loss from operations other expense income interest expense interest income loss on extinguishment of debt gain loss on warrant and embedded derivatives amortization of debt costs accretion on convertible debt discount early debt conversion fee other income  net loss before income taxes income tax benefit net loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales net sales for the year ended december   decreased to million from million for  a decrease of million or 
when compared to the prior year  in california sales of million were down  florida sales of million were down  arizona sales of million were down and texas sales of million were down 
the decrease in florida was due to a return to pre levels of sales in the region 
net sales in florida in were bolstered by a major classroom project stemming from the hurricanes in the fall of the decrease in sales in in california was primarily due to project delays in the education market  lower production volumes in part due to factory inefficiencies and periodic labor shortages in california 
in addition  in the prior year periods more of our california revenue was attributable to fieldwork on large school projects 
in the current year period we were more reliant on revenue generated from the shipment of factory built units for both schools and commercial customers 
it is believed that the demise of the piggyback contracting system in california has had an adverse affect on the sales volume in recent quarters 
prior to january  many school districts in california utilized piggy back contracts which allowed them to order buildings off of contracts bid and entered into by builders  including modtech  with other school districts 
since january   these piggyback contracts are no longer allowed 
as a result  more public bids will have to occur for the same volume of work 
because the public bidding process is a lengthy one  it is our belief that this change has delayed some anticipated work into in the long term  we expect the demand for our products and services will not be significantly impacted by the change in the piggyback contracting system 
gross profit gross profit for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million from the gross profit of million recorded the previous year 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in down from a gross margin of in our gross profit margin declined as revenues declined more than expected and we were not able to reduce fixed and certain variable costs as quickly as revenues declined 
in addition  the prior year margins benefited from volume efficiencies related to record results 
selling  general and administrative expense in  selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased million over the prior year to million with sg a costs representing of net sales compared to of net sales in the prior year 
the increase in sg a was primarily attributable to a million provision to the allowance for contract adjustments and million in stock compensation expense as a result of the implementation of sfas r 
stock compensation expense was reported in the past on a pro forma basis pursuant to the predecessor to sfas r  sfas excluding the provision to the allowance for contract adjustments and stock compensation expense  sg a costs declined million from to due to reduced legal  accounting and professional services as well as reduced sales commissions that resulted from lower sales 
in the third quarter of management took actions to reduce sg a costs  primarily by a reduction of staffing 
goodwill during the fourth quarter of  our stock price declined significantly and in the first quarter of our market capitalization fell below the amount of our recorded equity 
as a result of the existence of this and other indicators  we performed an impairment test to determine if the value of goodwill was recoverable under the provisions of sfas  and it was determined that an impairment existed 
as a result of this test  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of to reduce our carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value 
the fair value estimate used in the initial goodwill impairment test was based on the trading price of our stock and the present value of future cash flows 
the final measurement of the impairment has yet to be completed in its entirety as of the filing of our annual report on form k for the year ended december  the estimated impairment charge represents management s current best estimate as to the actual charge  which may be higher or lower than the estimated charge 
should operating results for future periods fall short of the updated projections  further impairments to goodwill could be required 
in the future  goodwill may be further impaired by events or circumstances which include  but are not limited to  things such as continued operating losses  unanticipated competition  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  or other factors leading to a decline in estimated future cash flows 
operating income loss operating losses increased to million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  from million in losses  or of net sales  for the year ended december  the increase in operating losses was a result of the decline in net sales and gross margins  the impairment loss on goodwill and the increase in sg a expenses as discussed above 
other income expense interest expense decreased from million in to million in the decrease is attributable to significantly reduced debt during as compared to we recognized a million loss on extinguishment of debt 
this consisted of a million write off of the unamortized debt issue costs of the fortress credit corp 
credit facility when it was replaced in the first quarter of with a credit facility from bank of america na  a million write off of the unamortized debt issue cost of the bank of america credit facility when the credit facility was replaced in the fourth quarter of with loans from laurus master fund  ltd  million in early termination fees paid to bank of america during the fourth quarter of and amortization of a portion of the debt issue costs associated with the promissory notes issued to laurus 
in addition we incurred a loss on the redemption of our million convertible note issued to amphora limited convertible note 
on november  we redeemed the balance of the convertible note with a face value of million through a combination of the conversion of one million shares pursuant to the terms of the note and the payment of million cash 
the shares issued upon conversion were recorded at the per share conversion price of the notes 
the loss on extinguishment is calculated based on the million discounted amount of the convertible note and includes the write off of million in debt issuance costs and the non cash benefit of writing off the million embedded derivative 
we recognized a non cash gain of million related to the embedded and warrant derivatives associated with the convertible note and outstanding warrants in amortization of debt costs for was million 
accretion of convertible debt discount for was million  which included million incremental non cash charges related to the discount on the million conversion of convertible notes in we recognized non cash early debt conversion fees of million in in the second quarter of  million of the non cash early debt conversion fee was recognized for the fair value of  restricted shares issued to amphora limited as consideration for the early conversion of a portion of the convertible note 
in the fourth quarter of  million of the non cash early debt conversion fee was recognized for the fair value of  incremental shares issued  or to be issued  to laurus master fund  ltd 
as consideration for the early conversion of the convertible note issued in the incremental shares issued in the fourth quarter of were the result of reducing the conversion price of the laurus note during the quarter to per share 
income tax benefit no benefit for income tax was recorded in or although we expect to return to profitability in  no tax benefit was recognized because under applicable accounting standards our cumulative losses for the three years ended december  are deemed to have created significant negative evidence that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize our net deferred tax assets 
therefore  a valuation allowance has been recorded against our net deferred tax assets  which totals million at december   and million at december  our effective tax rate was before the deferred tax asset valuation adjustment compared to prior year at and is expected to remain approximately within this range for the lower effective tax rate in is due primarily to the goodwill impairment charge of million 
the lower effective tax rate in is due primarily to the million in non cash losses for the embedded and warrant derivatives  which are not deductible for tax purposes 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales net sales for the year ended december  increased to million from million in  an increase of million  or approximately 
when compared to the prior year  florida sales of million were up  texas sales of million were up  arizona sales of million were down and california sales of million were up 
the large increase in sales in florida in was the result of continued growth in that state s school market and projects resulting from hurricane damage from storms in both and the growth in revenues from texas in was due to dealer sales in the last three months of the year generated by reconstruction activity following hurricanes katrina and rita 
the increase in california sales in was principally from classroom sales  including both relocatable and permanent modular construction  which increased to million when compared to this increase in net sales was due to the high backlog from being worked down in and returned to historical levels 
gross profit gross profit for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million over the gross loss of million recorded the previous year 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to in up from a gross loss of in although gross profit in improved significantly over  it was below expectations because of three factors 
first  estimated cost overruns of million were charged to the campbell union elementary school district monroe middle school project in san jose  california during second  there were actual cost overruns totaling approximately million on three projects in florida during the year 
finally  approximately million in costs were incurred in closing two plants in california 
a number of issues plagued the campbell project  including a delay in approval of our plans by the california department of state architect 
disputes over the type of construction and project scope  combined with estimated cost increases due to the long delay between the awarding of the contract in late and the commencement of construction in the last week of december caused the projected cost overruns 
in accordance with aicpa s statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts these estimated future cost overruns were recorded in even though most of the costs were incurred in the project was completed in the disputes over the contract have led to litigation between modtech and the campbell school district  which is further described in item of this report 
completion of the first two story school project in florida resulted in actual cost overruns of approximately million 
the two story school project  which was bid in late  involved a new  complex product and suffered from manufacturing and field issues related to the complexity of the product 
the primary cause of the million in cost overruns on the other two projects was the completion of work in the field that should have been completed in the factory 
since these two projects were shipped  additional controls were put in place at all of our factories to prevent the premature shipment of unfinished buildings 
management believes these controls have been effective in preventing further cost overruns of this type 
our facility in lathrop  california was closed in april  and subsequently subleased in september  closure of this facility resulted in approximately million of costs associated with turnover of the facility to the new tenant and the transfer of certain equipment to our primary perris  california factory 
at the end of december  we also closed a small factory in perris  california  keeping only a storage yard under lease 
the cost to transfer certain equipment to our primary perris  california factory was minimal  but the acceleration of deprecation on leasehold equipment and certain equipment totaled approximately million 
the closure of these two facilities will reduce future net lease costs by approximately million per year 
selling  general and administrative expense in  selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased million over the prior year to million with sg a costs representing of net sales compared to of net sales in the prior year 
sarbanes oxley compliance costs increased due to higher internal costs and costs associated with independent testing 
other incremental sg a costs were associated with higher volume 
goodwill there was no impairment of goodwill recorded for the year ended december  because our fair value as determined by the december  closing stock price exceeded book value 
in the future  goodwill may be impaired by events or circumstances that lower the fair value below book value 
these events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  things such as continued operating losses  unanticipated competition  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  or other factors leading to a decline in estimated future cash flows 
operating income loss operating losses decreased to million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  from million in losses  or of net sales  for the year ended december  the decrease in operating losses was due to the increase in revenues as discussed above 
interest expense net interest expense increased from million in to million in the increase is attributable to higher interest rates and significantly greater borrowings under our credit facility due to our operating losses during also included in is the amortization of debt issuance costs of million and accretion of convertible debt discount in the amount of million 
in addition  million in penalties and waiver fees were incurred as a result of loan covenant violations and delays in registering the shares of common stock issued in connection with our convertible note 
income tax benefit no benefit for income tax was recorded in this compares to the benefit for income tax of million recorded for the year ended december  no tax benefit was recognized because under applicable accounting standards our cumulative losses for the three years ended december  were deemed to have created significant negative evidence that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize our net deferred tax assets 
therefore  a valuation allowance was recorded against our net deferred tax assets  which totaled million at december   and million at december  our effective tax rate was before the deferred tax asset valuation adjustment compared to the prior year at 
the lower effective tax rate in is due primarily to the million in non cash losses for the embedded and warrant derivatives  which are not deductible for tax purposes 
liquidity and capital resources in recent years we have funded our operations and capital expenditures mostly with cash generated internally by operations  borrowings under various credit facilities  cash received from exercised options and private placements of equity 
cash and cash equivalents were million at december  compared to million at december  the increase was primarily due to net proceeds from financing activities and the proceeds from the sales leaseback of our plant city facility  partially offset by operating losses and capital expenditures 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flows from operations in will be sufficient to fund our operations and anticipated capital expenditures for at least the next months 
cash totaling million was used by operating activities during compared to cash used of million during during  the net loss  adjusted for non cash expenses from the loss on abandonment of leasehold improvements  depreciation and amortization  provision for contract adjustments  write off of debt issuance costs  loss on extinguishment of debt  impairment loss on goodwill  loss on sale of equipment  stock compensation expense  gain on derivative liability  accretion on convertible debt discount and early debt conversion fees settled with shares of common stock used million of operating cash 
changes in remaining working capital balances during this period provided million in cash 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in compared to net cash used in investing activities of million in the proceeds from the sale of equipment relates to our november  sale of our manufacturing plant in florida to nl ventures v  lp for million 
concurrently with the sale of the property  we entered into a lease agreement with the purchaser s assignee  nl ventures v plant city  lp  pursuant to which we leased back the property for an initial term of years 
we have the option to extend the lease term for two additional terms of five years each 
the annual rent is  for the first year of the lease and increases at the rate of per annum thereafter 
we have posted a security deposit of million in connection with the lease 
capital expenditures were million in compared to million in net cash provided by financing activities was million during fiscal proceeds from the laurus borrowings totaled million offset by million in principal payments on long term debt and the revolving credit line 
stock option and warrant exercises generated million of proceeds in debt instruments in october  we issued a million convertible note and a million term note to laurus master fund  ltd 
the convertible note could be converted at a conversion price of per share for the first  of principal  per share for the next  of principal  and for the last  of principal 
in december  the conversion price for the entire convertible note was reduced to per share  laurus converted  of the principal into  shares of our common stock and we issued to laurus a million term note 
in february  the remaining principal balance of the convertible note was converted into  shares of our common stock 
the convertible note is no longer outstanding 
the million term note and the million term note bear interest at an adjustable rate equal to the prime rate as published in the wall street journal  plus and  respectively 
until it was converted  the million convertible note bore interest on the same terms as the currently outstanding million term note 
the interest rates on the outstanding notes will be adjusted with each adjustment in the prime rate 
in connection with the original issuance of the notes to laurus master fund  ltd 
in october  we deposited million in a restricted account with north fork bank from which the first year s interest on the original notes was to be paid 
the deposit was equivalent to one year s interest on both notes at their interest rates on the date of issuance 
the remaining balance of the deposit will be used to pay the interest on the currently outstanding notes which is payable monthly 
principal payments of  commenced on the million term note on february  and will continue on the same day of each month thereafter 
principal payments of  commenced on the million term note on april  and continue on the same day of each month thereafter 
the maturity dates of the million note and the million note are october  and december   respectively 
both notes may be prepaid in whole  but not in part or separately  at any time by paying to the holder of the aggregate principal balance and accrued interest 
the notes are secured by substantially all of our assets 
amounts owed under the two notes may be accelerated and are subject to default rate interest charges under various circumstances  including  but not limited to  the failure to make principal or interest payments when due under the notes  breaches of certain covenants  representations  conditions and warranties set forth in the notes and the purchase agreement pursuant to which they were issued  including  without limitation  the failure to maintain on a monthly basis at least million in cash and eligible accounts receivable  the occurrence of certain insolvency or bankruptcy events affecting us  a change of control in the company  and certain judgments  liens and attachments in excess of permitted amounts 
the purchase agreements with laurus pursuant to which the notes were issued contain certain negative covenants  including  without limitation  restrictions on our ability to  among other things  pay dividends  incur debt  or change its business 
in connection with the issuance of the promissory notes to laurus master fund  ltd 
described above  we issued to laurus two warrants in october for  shares and  shares  respectively  and a warrant in december for  shares 
the october warrants are exercisable until october  at the following exercise prices  shares at per share   shares at per share  and  at per share 
the december warrant is exercisable until december  at the following exercise prices  shares at per share   shares at per share and  shares at per share 
contractual obligations the following table represents a list of our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by year ending december  debt operating leases total thereafter we do not have any capital lease obligations or purchase obligations  nor do we have any other form of long term liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheet under gaap that are not set forth in the preceding table 
use of estimates and critical accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of assets  liabilities  revenue and expense reported in the statements 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and continually evaluate our estimates and assumptions  nevertheless  estimates are inherently uncertain and actual results could significantly differ from our estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most significant accounting policies 
allowances for contract adjustments we maintain allowances for contract adjustments that result from the inability of our customers to make their required payments 
management bases its allowances on analysis of the aging of accounts receivable  by account  at the date of the financial statements  assessments of historical collection trends  and an evaluation of the impact of current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
accrual for worker s compensation reserve prior to july   we were self insured for workers compensation under a high deductible program 
management bases its accrual estimate on input from the insurance carrier which includes information regarding open and closed cases  historical costs associated with those claims  certain developed costs and an estimate of incurred but not reported ibnr claims 
variation from the estimates of future liability claims from the pre july  claims is not only possible  but probable 
the inherent variability may result in actual costs being either above or below the estimates recorded on our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition on construction contracts contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting and  therefore  take into account the costs  estimated earnings and revenue to date on contracts not yet completed 
revenue recognized is that percentage of the total contract price that cost expended to date bears to anticipated final total cost  based on current estimates of costs to complete 
the percentage of completion methodology generally results in the recognition of reasonably consistent profit margins over the life of a contract 
cumulative revenues recognized may be less or greater than cumulative costs and profits billed at any point in time during a contract s term 
the resulting difference is recognized as unbilled or deferred revenue 
any estimation process  including that used in preparing contract accounting models  involves inherent risk 
we attempt to reduce the inherent risk relating to revenue and cost estimates in percentage of completion models through corporate policy  approval and monitoring processes 
risks relating to project delivery  productivity and other factors are considered in the estimation process 
our estimates of revenues and costs on construction contracts change periodically in the normal course of business due to factors such as productivity and modifications of contractual arrangements 
such changes are reflected in the results of operations as a change in accounting estimate in the period the revisions are determined 
provisions for estimated losses are made in the period in which the loss first becomes apparent 
valuation of the embedded and warrant derivatives the valuation of our embedded derivatives and warrant derivatives are determined primarily by the black scholes option pricing model 
an embedded derivative is a derivative instrument that is embedded within another contract  which under the convertible note the host contract includes the right to convert the note by the holder  certain default redemption right premiums and a change of control premium payable in cash if a fundamental change occurs 
in accordance with fasb statement no 
 as amended  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  these embedded derivatives are marked to market each reporting period  with a corresponding non cash gain or loss charged to the current period 
a warrant derivative liability is determined in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock eitf 
based on eitf  warrants which are determined to be classified as derivative liabilities are marked to market each reporting period  with a corresponding non cash gain or loss charged to the current period 
the practical effect of this has been that when our stock price increases so does our derivative liability  resulting in a non cash loss charge that reduces our earnings and earnings per share 
when our stock price declines  we record a non cash gain  increasing our earnings and earnings per share 
to determine the fair value of our embedded derivatives  management evaluates assumptions regarding the probability of certain future events 
other factors used to determine fair value include our period end stock price  historical stock volatility  risk free interest rate and derivative term 
the fair value recorded for the derivative liability varies from period to period 
this variability may result in the actual derivative liability for a period either above or below the estimates recorded on our consolidated financial statements  resulting in significant fluctuations in other income expense because of the corresponding non cash gain or loss recorded 
new accounting standards in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin requires the use of a two step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosures regarding uncertainties in income tax positions 
we were required to adopt fin effective january  the cumulative effect of initially adopting fin will be recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings in the year of adoption and will be presented separately 
only tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized upon adoption of fin we are currently evaluating the impact this new standard  however  the standard is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operation or cash flows 
in july  the fasb issued staff position no 
fas  accounting for a change or projected change in the timing of cash flows relating to income taxes generated by a leveraged lease transaction fsp 
fsp requires that changes in the projected timing of income tax cash flows generated by a leveraged lease transaction be recognized as a gain or loss in the year in which change occurs 
the pretax gain or loss is required to be included in the same line item in which the leveraged lease income is recognized  with the tax effect being included in the provision for income taxes 
we were required to adopt fsp effective january  the cumulative effect of initially adopting this fsp will be recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings in the year of adoption and will be presented separately 
fsp is not expected to have any impact on our financial position  results of operation or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas does not require new fair value measurements but rather defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently assessing the impact of sfas on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
sab provides guidance on quantifying and evaluating the materiality of unrecorded misstatements 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending after november   with earlier application encouraged for any interim period of the first fiscal year ending after november   filed after the publication of sab september  
the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in november  the eitf reached a final consensus in eitf issue debtor s accounting for a modification or exchange of convertible debt instruments eitf no 

eitf no 
addresses the modification of a convertible debt instrument that changes the fair value of an embedded conversion option and the subsequent recognition of interest expense for the associated debt instrument when the modification does not result in a debt extinguishment pursuant to eitf no 
 debtor s accounting for a modification or exchange of debt instruments 
the consensus should be applied to modifications or exchanges of debt instruments occurring in interim or annual periods beginning after november  the company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in november  the fasb ratified eitf issue no 
 issuer s accounting for a previously bifurcated conversion option in a convertible debt instrument when the conversion option no longer meets the bifurcation criteria in fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities eitf no 

at the time of issuance  an embedded conversion option in a convertible debt instrument may be required to be bifurcated from the debt instrument and accounted for separately by the issuer as a derivative under sfas no 
 based on the application of eitf no 
subsequent to the issuance of the convertible debt  facts may change and cause the embedded conversion option to no longer meet the conditions for separate accounting as a derivative instrument  such as when the bifurcated instrument meets the conditions of issue to be classified in stockholders equity 
under eitf no 
 when an embedded conversion option previously accounted for as a derivative under sfas no 
no longer meets the bifurcation criteria under that standard  an issuer shall disclose a description of the principal changes causing the embedded conversion option to no longer require bifurcation under sfas no 
and the amount of the liability for the conversion option reclassified to stockholders equity 
eitf no 
should be applied to all previously bifurcated conversion options in convertible debt instruments that no longer meet the bifurcation criteria in sfas no 
in interim or annual periods beginning after december   regardless of whether the debt instrument was entered into prior or subsequent to the effective date of eitf no 
earlier application of eitf no 
is permitted in periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp eitf accounting for registration payment arrangements fsp eitf which specifies that the contingent obligation to make future payments or otherwise transfer consideration under a registration payment arrangement should be separately recognized and measured in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
adoption of fsp eitf is required for fiscal years beginning after december  the company is currently evaluating the expected effect of fsp eitf on its consolidated financial statements and is currently not yet in a position to determine such effects 
in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment to fasb statement no 
this statement permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
this statement is expected to expand the use of fair value measurement of accounting for financial instruments 
this statement applies to all entities  including not for profit 
the fair value option established by this statement permits all entities to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after november  we are currently assessing the impact adoption of sfas no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements 
seasonality historically  our quarterly revenues have been highest in the second and third quarters of each calendar year because a large number of orders for modular classrooms placed by school districts require that classrooms be constructed  delivered and installed in time for the upcoming new school year which generally commences in september 
we have typically been able to add employees as needed to respond to the increases in manufacturing output required by this seasonal demand 
our first and fourth quarter revenues are typically lower due to greater number of holidays and days of inclement weather during such periods 
in addition  our operating margins may vary on a quarterly basis depending upon the mix of revenues between standardized classrooms and higher margin customized classrooms and the timing of the completion of large  higher margin customized contracts 
we anticipate that the impact of seasonal demand for classrooms will diminish due to the growing impact of multi year contracts and increased sales outside the traditional classroom market 
however  these factors will not fully offset the impact of inclement weather and concentrations of holidays 
so although the impact of seasonal demand is expected to be diminished  revenue and margins in the first and fourth quarters will likely be lower than in the second and third quarters 
the following tables present our unaudited quarterly information for each quarter of fiscal years  and and reflects the seasonality of our business 
in the opinion of management  all necessary adjustments  which consist only of normal and recurring accruals  have been included to fairly present the unaudited quarterly results 
this data should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
fourth quarter third quarter second quarter first quarter net sales gross loss profit net loss income loss earnings per common share basic diluted fourth quarter third quarter second quarter first quarter net sales gross loss profit net loss income loss earnings per common share basic diluted fourth quarter third quarter second quarter first quarter net sales gross loss profit net loss income loss earnings per common share basic diluted inflation we are subject to the effects of changing prices 
during the years ended december  and december   there was no significant inflationary impact  but during we realized dramatic increases in the price of certain commodities used in the production of our products  in particular steel  dimensional lumber and plywood products 
many of our contracts at the time did not allow us to pass these costs on to our customers 
while the cost outlook for these and other commodities used in our production is not certain  management believes it can manage these inflationary pressures with sales price adjustments that are allowed by our newer contracts and by actively pursuing internal cost reduction efforts  including improved supply chain and inventory management 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market factors such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  or equity prices will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of instruments 
we are exposed to the risk of increased interest rates on our current debt instruments and the risk of loss on credit extended to our customers 
we have issued equity instruments  including warrants and a convertible note which contain certain derivatives which fluctuate  primarily as a result of changes in our stock price 
interest rate risk we are exposed to the risk of fluctuation in interest rates on our debt instruments 
during  we did not use interest rate swaps or other types of derivative financial instruments to hedge our interest rate risk 
our outstanding debt instruments with laurus master fund  ltd 
bear interest at adjustable rates equal to the prime rate as published in the wall street journal  plus and  respectively 
the debt outstanding under these notes during will be million 
therefore  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense of approximately  per annum 
credit risk our credit terms generally are net for dealer accounts and defined by contracts which vary for direct sales 
we actively monitor the risk of loss through a variety of control procedures involving senior management 
historically  credit losses have been less than of sales and within our expectations 
derivative liability risk we are exposed to the risk of fair value derivative liability related to outstanding warrants 
the fair value of these derivative liabilities is primarily determined by fluctuations in our stock price 
as our stock price increases or decreases  the fair value of these derivative liabilities increase or decrease  resulting in a corresponding current period loss or gain to be recognized 
based on the number of outstanding warrants  market interest rates and historical volatility of our stock price as of december   a increase or decrease in our stock price results in a non cash derivative loss or gain of approximately million to million 
during and  we experienced a million non cash gain and a million non cash loss  respectively  on warrant and convertible note embedded derivatives
