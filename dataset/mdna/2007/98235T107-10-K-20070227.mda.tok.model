executive overview company description 
we are a global orthopaedic medical device company specializing in the design  manufacture and marketing of reconstructive joint devices and biologics products 
reconstructive joint devices are used to replace knee  hip and other joints that have deteriorated through disease or injury 
biologics are used to replace damaged or diseased bone  to stimulate bone growth and to provide other biological solutions for surgeons and their patients 
we have been in business for over years and have built a well known and respected brand name and strong relationships with orthopaedic surgeons 
our corporate headquarters and us operations are located in arlington  tennessee  where we conduct our domestic research and development  manufacturing  warehousing and administrative activities 
outside the us  we have research and development  manufacturing and administrative facilities in toulon  france  research  distribution and administrative facilities in milan  italy  distribution and administrative facilities in amsterdam  the netherlands  and sales and distribution offices in canada  japan and throughout europe 
we market our products in over countries through a global distribution system that consists of a sales force of approximately individuals who promote our products to orthopaedic surgeons and hospitals 
at the end of  we had approximately independent distributors and sales associates in the us  and approximately sales representatives internationally who were employed through a combination of our stocking distribution partners and direct sales offices 
company history 
we were incorporated in november  as a delaware corporation  and had no operations until december  when we acquired majority ownership of our predecessor company  wright medical technology  inc in a recapitalization  and immediately thereafter acquired cremascoli ortho holding  sa  an orthopaedic medical device company headquartered in toulon  france 
in  we sold  shares of common stock in our initial public offering  which generated million in net proceeds 
in  we sold  shares of common stock in a secondary offering which generated million in net proceeds 

table of contents principal products 
we primarily sell reconstructive joint devices and biologics products 
our reconstructive joint device sales are derived from three primary product lines knees and hips  collectively referred to as our reconstructive large joint business  and extremities 
our biologics sales are derived from a broad portfolio of products designed to stimulate and augment the natural regenerative capabilities of the human body 
we also sell orthopaedic products not considered to be part of our knee  hip  extremity or biologics product lines 
our hip joint reconstruction product portfolio provides offerings in the areas of bone conserving implants  total hip reconstruction  revision replacement implants and limb preservation 
our hip joint products include the conserve family of products  the profemur hip system  the lineage acetabular system  the anca fit hip system  and the perfecta hip system 
our knee reconstruction products position us well in the areas of total knee reconstruction  revision replacement implants and limb preservation products 
our principal knee product is the advance knee system 
we offer extremity products for the hand  wrist  elbow  shoulder  foot and ankle in a number of markets worldwide 
our principal extremity products include the evolve modular radial head system  the charlotte foot and ankle system  the locon t and locon vls distal radius plating systems  and the micronail intramedullary wrist fracture repair system 
we also sell the swanson line of finger and toe joint replacement products and the orthosphere carpometacarpal implant for repair of the basal thumb joint 
our biologics products focus on biological musculoskeletal repair and include synthetic and human tissue based materials 
our principal biologics products include the graftjacket soft tissue repair and containment membranes  the allomatrix line of injectable tissue based bone graft substitutes  the osteoset synthetic bone graft substitute  and the miig family of minimally invasive injectable synthetic bone grafts 
significant business developments 
net sales grew in  totaling million  compared to million in our hip and extremity product lines contributed significantly to our performance in  achieving and growth rates  respectively 
our net income decreased to million in from million in  primarily as a result of the recognition of million million net of taxes of non cash stock based compensation expense in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment fas r  partially offset by a million gain recognized upon the sale of an investment and a million income tax benefit resulting from the resolution of certain foreign tax matters in during  our domestic biologics business returned to year over year growth  totaling for the full year  as the sales growth in our graftjacket soft tissue repair and containment membranes offset the continued declining sales of our dbm demineralized bone matrix containing allomatrix family of products 
we anticipate that growth within our domestic biologics business will continue to increase  as sales of our graftjacket products continue to increase  and as we expand our biologics product offerings 
our international sales increased by during as compared to increased sales are attributable to growth in japan and certain geographic regions within our european operations  most significantly in the middle east and africa region and germany 
also of note is the turnaround in our italian operations  where after experiencing declining sales since the fourth quarter of  we achieved sales growth during the last three quarters of further  while we continued to experience sales declines in our french market this year  we anticipate that we will see sales growth in this region in the latter half of significant industry factors 
our industry is impacted by numerous competitive  regulatory and other significant factors 
the growth of our business relies on our ability to continue to develop new products and innovative technologies  obtain regulatory clearance and compliance for our products  protect the proprietary technology of our products and our manufacturing processes  manufacture our products cost effectively  respond to competitive pressures specific to each of our geographic markets  including our ability to enforce non compete agreements  and 
table of contents successfully market and distribute our products in a profitable manner 
we  and the entire industry  are subject to extensive governmental regulation  primarily by the fda 
failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business 
additionally  our industry is highly competitive and has recently experienced increased pricing pressures  specifically in the areas of reconstructive joints 
we devote significant resources to assessing and analyzing competitive  regulatory and economic risks and opportunities 
a detailed discussion of these and other factors is provided in risk factors 
in addition to the factors noted above  in and  as part of a governmental inquiry into the orthopaedic industry  several of our competitors received subpoenas from the united states department of justice the doj 
based on publicly available information  we believe that these subpoenas requested information related to antitrust issues in regard to these companies relationships with orthopaedic surgeons 
as of the date of this report  we have not been contacted by the doj or received a subpoena from the doj relating to this investigation 
net sales and expense components net sales 
we derive our net sales primarily from the sale of reconstructive joint devices and biologics products 
an overview of our principal product lines is provided in md a executive overview 
cost of sales 
our cost of sales consists primarily of direct labor  allocated manufacturing overhead  raw materials and components  non cash stock based compensation  charges incurred for excess and obsolete inventories  royalty expenses associated with licensing technologies used in our products or processes  and certain other period expenses 
selling  general and administrative 
our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  sales commissions  royalty and consulting expenses associated with our medical advisors  marketing costs  facility costs  legal costs  non cash stock based compensation  other general business and administrative expenses and depreciation expense associated with reusable surgical instruments that are used to implant our products 
research and development 
research and development expense includes costs associated with the design  development  testing  deployment  enhancement and regulatory approval of our products 
amortization of intangible assets 
our intangible assets consist of purchased intangibles related to completed technology  distribution channels and trademarks primarily resulting from our acquisition of cremascoli  as well as distribution and product licenses  and non compete agreements 
we amortize intangible assets over periods ranging from one to years 
interest income expense  net 
interest income expense  net  consists primarily of interest on borrowings outstanding under our previous senior credit facility  capital lease agreements  and certain of our factoring agreements  as well as non cash expenses associated with the amortization of deferred financing costs resulting from the origination of our current and previous senior credit facilities 
these expenses are offset by income generated by our invested cash balances and investments in marketable securities 
provision for income taxes 
we record provisions for income taxes on earnings generated by both our domestic and international operations 
historically  our effective tax rates have varied from our statutory tax rates primarily due to research and development credits  changes in estimates related to our valuation allowances recorded against our net deferred tax assets  and  in  the recognition of non cash stock based compensation expense  a significant portion of which may not be deductible under us and foreign tax regulations 
results of operations introduction 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of fas r 
we elected the modified prospective method of transition  under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
as a result  our results of operations during will not be comparable to our prior year results 
we recorded approximately 
table of contents million million net of taxes of non cash stock based compensation expense during the year ended december  see note to our consolidated financial statements in financial statements and supplementary data for further information regarding our stock based compensation assumptions and expenses  including pro forma disclosures for prior periods as if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
to stock based employee compensation expense 
we also discuss the effect of stock based compensation on certain individual line items in our consolidated statement of operations in comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  our results of operations expressed as dollar amounts in thousands and as percentages of net sales year ended december  of of amount sales amount sales net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development amortization of intangible assets total operating expenses operating income interest income  net other income expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income the following table sets forth our net sales by product line for the periods indicated in thousands and the percentage of year over year change year ended year ended december  december  change hip products knee products biologics products extremity products other total net sales 
table of contents the following graphs illustrate our product line sales as a percentage of total net sales for the years ended december  and pie chart pie chart net sales 
our net sales growth in was primarily attributable to the continued growth in our hip product line  which grew over  as well as increases in our extremities and biologics product lines  which grew and  respectively 
geographically  our domestic net sales totaled million in and million in  representing approximately of total net sales in both years  and growth of 
our international net sales totaled million in  a increase as compared to net sales of million in this increase in international sales is attributable to continued growth in japan and successful market expansion initiatives in certain regions within our european operations  which were partially offset by continued declines in france 
our hip product sales totaled million in  representing a increase over domestic hip sales in grew as compared to prior year  driven primarily by the continued successes of our conserve total implant with bfh technology and our profemur line of primary stems featuring our innovative neck modularity 
these increased sales are attributable to volume increases  as well as favorable shifts within our conserve product mix to our higher priced a class advanced metal products 
our international markets further contributed to the success of our hip product line in  posting growth over our international growth was led by japan  due to increased sales within our profemur line of primary stems and our anca fit hip system 
also contributing to the international growth in were our european operations  particularly in those areas where we successfully initiated our market expansion programs 
our extremity product sales increased to million in  representing growth of over this year over year growth was primarily driven by performance in our domestic markets  where we achieved growth  as well as expansion within our european operations 
this growth is mainly attributable to increased unit sales of our charlotte foot and ankle system  as well as the continued success of our micronail intramedullary wrist fracture repair system 
net sales of our biologics products totaled million in  which represents a increase over this increase was driven primarily by our international business  which grew over prior year  due to the market expansions within our european operations 
in the us  biologics sales grew over prior year  as a result of continued unit sales growth of our higher priced graftjacket tissue repair and containment membranes  which was mostly offset by the continued decline of our dbm containing products 
sales of our knee products totaled million in  which was relatively static as compared to year over year growth in our advance knee systems in both our international and domestic markets  which totaled and  respectively  was offset by declines across our other  more mature knee product offerings 

table of contents looking ahead to  we anticipate that our international markets may grow at a higher rate than our domestic business  as we continue to see the positive results of our market expansion initiatives in europe  and as we see a recovery in our france markets 
we expect that our us business will continue to expand in all product lines  as the strength of our current product portfolio combines with our anticipated product launches in cost of sales 
in  our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased from in to in our cost of sales included approximately percentage points of non cash stock based compensation expense recorded pursuant to fas r 
cost of sales in included million of net sales of charges to write down inventory to its net realizable value due to the termination of an agreement to distribute certain third party spinal products in europe 
our cost of sales and corresponding gross profit percentages can be expected to fluctuate in future periods depending upon changes in our product sales mix and prices  distribution channels and geographies  manufacturing yields  period expenses and levels of production volume 
selling  general and administrative 
our selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales totaled in  a percentage point increase from in our selling  general and administrative expenses include approximately million of net sales of non cash stock based compensation recorded pursuant to fas r  as compared to approximately  of net sales of non cash stock based compensation recognized in our selling  general and administrative expenses included severance charges of approximately million of net sales related to the transition of management in our us and european operations  and charges of approximately million of net sales related to a european distributor transition and the related legal dispute 
the remaining increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in is attributable to increased investments in sales and marketing initiatives  higher levels of cash incentive compensation  and increased depreciation expense 
we anticipate that our selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars to the extent that any additional growth in net sales results in increases in sales commissions and royalty expense associated with those sales and requires us to expand our infrastructure 
however  we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales will decrease in future periods as we manage the growth of our existing infrastructure while continuing to expand our business 
research and development 
our investment in research and development activities represented approximately of net sales in  as compared to in the increase was driven by million of net sales of non cash stock based compensation recorded in pursuant to fas r 
our remaining investment in research and development in was relatively static as a percentage of net sales as compared to  as our investment increased in absolute dollars for higher levels of spending in clinical and regulatory and pre clinical studies  while our business expanded at the same rate 
we anticipate that our research and development expenditures may increase as a percentage of net sales and will increase in absolute dollars as we increase our product development initiatives and clinical studies to support regulatory approvals and provide expanded proof of the efficacy of our products 
amortization of intangible assets 
non cash charges associated with amortization of intangible assets totaled million in  as compared to million in based on the intangible assets held at december   we expect to amortize approximately million in  million in  million in   in and  in interest income  net 
interest income  net  totaled approximately million and  during and  respectively 
interest income  net  consisted of interest expense of million and million during and  respectively  primarily from borrowings under our capital lease agreements  certain of our factoring agreements  our previous senior credit facility  and  in  approximately  of interest related to an unfavorable judgment rendered on a year old legal dispute  offset by interest income of million and million during and  respectively  
table of contents generated by our invested cash balances and investments in marketable securities 
the increase in interest income was driven by a full year of investments in marketable securities in other income expense  net 
other income expense  net  totaled million of income during  including a gain of approximately million upon the sale of an investment  as compared to  of expense during provision for income taxes 
we recorded tax provisions of million and million in and  respectively 
our effective tax rate for and was approximately and  respectively 
our effective tax rate includes a million benefit that was realized upon the resolution of certain foreign tax matters 
our effective tax rate also includes the unfavorable impact of non cash stock based compensation expenses recorded under the provisions of fas r  a significant portion of which may not be deductible under us and foreign tax regulations and therefore  pursuant to fas r  do not benefit our current period tax provision 
the remaining decrease was primarily driven by increased interest income generated from our tax free investments 
we expect our effective tax rate to range from approximately to during this estimated effective tax rate is higher than our effective tax rate as a result of the favorable resolution of certain foreign tax matters 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  our results of operations expressed as dollar amounts in thousands and as percentages of net sales year ended december  of of amount sales amount sales net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development amortization of intangible assets total operating expenses operating income interest income expense  net other expense income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income 
table of contents the following table sets forth our net sales by product line for the periods indicated in thousands and the percentage of year over year change year ended year ended december  december  change hip products knee products biologics products extremity products other total net sales the following graphs illustrate our product line sales as a percentage of total net sales for the years ended december  and pie chart pie chart net sales 
our net sales growth in was primarily attributable to the success of our domestic reconstructive joint business  as our domestic hip  extremity and knee product lines grew by   and  respectively 
geographically  domestic net sales totaled million in and million in  representing approximately and of total net sales  respectively  and growth of 
international net sales totaled million in  a increase as compared to net sales of million in this increase in international sales was attributable to growth in our asian markets  which was partially offset by declines in our italian and french markets due to the transition of management and distribution personnel in southern europe 
from a product line perspective  our net sales growth for was attributable to increases in sales across three of our four principal product lines 
for  we experienced growth of  and in our extremity  hip and knee product lines  respectively 
our biologics product line sales were flat in as compared to during  our hip sales growth was attributable primarily to success in domestic markets  specifically driven by our conserve total implant with bfh technology and our profemur line of primary stems featuring our innovative neck modularity 
the growth of our extremity business in was primarily attributable to increased unit sales of our evolve modular radial head system and the successful mid february launch of our charlotte foot and ankle system 
cost of sales 
in  our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to as compared to in cost of sales in included charges of approximately million of net sales to write down inventory to its net realizable value due to the termination of an agreement to distribute certain third party spinal 
table of contents products in europe 
cost of sales in included charges of approximately million of net sales to write down certain foot and ankle inventory to its net realizable value as a result of the transition to our charlotte foot and ankle system 
the remaining increase in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales is attributable to increased levels of fixed manufacturing costs and distribution costs  as well as shifts in our product line sales 
operating expenses 
our total operating expenses increased  as a percentage of net sales  by percentage points to in operating expenses include selling  general and administrative expenses  research and development expenses  and amortization of intangibles 
the increase in operating expenses was attributed to higher selling  general and administrative expenses  which increased as a percentage of net sales by percentage points  driven by approximately million of net sales of severance charges and million of net sales of charges related to the european distributor transition  partially offset by lower levels of stock based compensation related to options issued prior to our ipo in also contributing to the increase in operating expenses was higher levels of r d spending for product development and clinical and regulatory costs 
interest income expense  net 
interest income expense  net  totaled million of expense in  as compared to  of income in this variance was driven by lower levels of interest expense related to our senior credit facility  as we paid down a significant portion of debt during  as well as higher levels of interest income generated from our investment in marketable securities during provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate for and was and  respectively  which reflects the impact of research and development credits  changes in estimates related to the valuation allowances recorded against our deferred tax assets and  in  the impact of the domestic manufacturers deduction included within the american jobs creation act of seasonal nature of business we traditionally experience lower sales volumes in the third quarter than throughout the rest of the year as a result of the european holiday schedule  typically resulting in selling  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses as a percentage of sales that are higher than throughout the rest of the year 
in addition  our first quarter selling  general and administrative expenses include additional expenses that we incur in connection with the annual meeting held by the american academy of orthopaedic surgeons 
this meeting  which is the largest orthopaedic meeting in the world  features the presentation of scientific papers and instructional courses for orthopaedic surgeons 
during this day event  we display our most recent and innovative products to these surgeons 
liquidity and capital resources the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain liquidity measures in thousands as of december  cash and cash equivalents short term marketable securities working capital line of credit availability at december   we have invested million of our excess cash balance in short term marketable debt securities in order to increase our rate of return 
specifically  our investments in marketable securities at december   are available for redemption through an auction process every or days from initial purchase  and are considered trading securities 
while these investments are not considered cash equivalents for financial reporting 
table of contents purposes  due to the short term nature of these investments  we do not believe that these investments will have an impact on our overall liquidity position 
operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities totaled million in  as compared to million in and million in the increase in cash provided by operating activities in is primarily attributable to million of cash used as a result of net changes in our marketable securities balances during  as compared to million used in lower levels of cash tax payments for us federal income taxes further contributed to the increase in operating cash flow for compared to the decrease in  as compared to  was attributable to the million investment in marketable securities  as well as higher levels of cash tax payments for estimated us federal income taxes 
investing activities 
our capital expenditures totaled approximately million in  million in  and million in the increase in and from is primarily related to investments in minimally invasive surgical instrumentation for our hip and knee businesses 
our industry is capital intensive  particularly as it relates to surgical instrumentation 
historically  our capital expenditures have consisted of purchased manufacturing equipment  research and testing equipment  computer systems  office furniture and equipment  and surgical instruments 
we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately million in total for for routine capital expenditures  as well as approximately million for the planned expansion of facilities in arlington  tn 
we invested approximately  in intellectual property during we are continuously evaluating opportunities to purchase technology and other forms of intellectual property and are  therefore  unable to predict the timing of future purchases 
financing activities 
during  we made approximately million in principal payments related to our long term capital lease obligations 
in addition  our operating subsidiary in italy continues to factor portions of its accounts receivable balances under factoring agreements  which are considered financing transactions for financial reporting 
the cash proceeds received from these factoring agreements  net of the amount of factored receivables collected  are reflected as cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
the proceeds received under these agreements in  and totaled approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
these proceeds were offset by payments for factored receivables collected of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we recorded obligations of million and million for the amount of receivables factored under these agreements as of december  and  respectively  which are included within accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
on june   we paid million to retire all remaining indebtedness under our then existing credit facility  cancelled the credit facility  and terminated the related credit agreement 
at the same time  we entered into a credit agreement with a group of banks led by bank of america  na the new credit agreement provides for a million revolving credit facility  which can be increased by up to an additional million at our request and subject to the agreement of the lenders 
we currently have no borrowings outstanding under the new credit facility 
borrowings under the new credit facility will bear interest at the sum of a base annual rate plus an applicable annual rate that ranges from to depending on the type of loan and our consolidated leverage ratio  with a current annual rate of 
those financing payments were offset by proceeds of million from the issuances of common stock under our stock based compensation plans 
in  we will make continued payments under our long term capital leases  including interest  of approximately million in we anticipate that our factoring program in italy will continue  however  the level and extent of the amounts factored under the agreement and the ultimate amount of proceeds received under the program cannot be predicted 

table of contents contractual cash obligations 
at december   we had contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments as follows in thousands payments due by periods total after amounts reflected in balance sheet capital lease obligations amounts not reflected in balance sheet operating leases purchase obligations royalty and consulting agreements total contractual cash obligations payments include amounts representing interest the amounts reflected in the table above for capital lease obligations represent future minimum lease payments under our capital lease agreements  which are primarily for certain property and equipment 
the present value of the minimum lease payments are recorded in our balance sheet at december  the minimum lease payments related to these leases are discussed further in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in financial statements and supplementary data 
the amounts reflected in the table above for operating leases represent future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases primarily for certain equipment and office space 
portions of these payments are denominated in foreign currencies and were translated in the table above based on their respective us dollar exchange rates at december  these future payments are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  our operating leases are not recognized in our consolidated balance sheet  however  the minimum lease payments related to these agreements are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in financial statements and supplementary data 
our purchase obligations reflected in the table above consist of minimum purchase obligations related to certain supply agreements 
the royalty and consulting agreements in the above table represent minimum payments to consultants that are contingent upon future services 
portions of these payments are denominated in foreign currencies and were translated in the table above based on their respective us dollar exchange rates at december  these future payments are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
our purchase obligations and royalty and consulting agreements are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in financial statements and supplementary data 
in addition to the contractual cash obligations discussed above  all of our domestic sales and a portion of our international sales are subject to commissions based on net sales  and a substantial portion of our global sales are subject to other royalties earned based on product sales 
further  under our factoring agreement in italy  our liability for cash proceeds received of million discussed in financing activities may be subject to repayment upon days notice 
none of these amounts are included in the table above 
other liquidity information 
we have funded our cash needs since through various equity and debt issuances and through cash flow from operations 
in  we completed our ipo of  shares of common stock which generated million in net proceeds 
in  we completed a secondary offering of  shares of common stock which generated million in net proceeds 
although it is difficult for us to predict our future liquidity requirements  we believe that our current cash balance of approximately million  our marketable securities balance of million  our existing available credit line of 
table of contents million and our expected cash flow from our operations will be sufficient for the foreseeable future to fund our working capital requirements and operations  permit anticipated capital expenditures in of approximately million and meet our contractual cash obligations in critical accounting estimates all of our significant accounting policies and estimates are described in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in financial statements and supplementary data 
however  certain of our more critical accounting estimates require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions in determining the estimate 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we develop these judgments based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers  and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
different  reasonable estimates could have been used in the current period 
additionally  changes in accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
both of these factors could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
we believe that the following financial estimates are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require subjective or complex judgments 
further  we believe that the items discussed below are properly recorded in the financial statements for all periods presented 
our management has discussed the development  selection  and disclosure of our most critical financial estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and with our independent auditors 
the judgments about those financial estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
those financial estimates include revenue recognition 
our revenues are primarily generated through two types of customers  hospitals and stocking distributors  with the majority of our revenue derived from sales to hospitals 
our products are primarily sold through a network of independent sales representatives in the us and by a combination of employee sales representatives  independent sales representatives  and stocking distributors outside the us we record revenues from sales to hospitals when the hospital takes title to the product  which is generally when the product is surgically implanted in a patient 
we record revenues from sales to our stocking distributors at the time the product is shipped to the distributor 
our stocking distributors  who sell the products to their customers  take title to the products and assume all risks of ownership 
our distributors are obligated to pay us within specified terms regardless of when  if ever  they sell the products 
in general  our distributors do not have any rights of return or exchange  however  in limited situations we have repurchase agreements with certain stocking distributors 
those certain agreements require us to repurchase a specified percentage of the inventory purchased by the distributor within a specified period of time prior to the expiration of the contract 
during those specified periods  we defer the applicable percentage of the sales 
approximately  and  of sales related to these types of agreements were deferred and not yet recognized as revenue as of december  and  respectively 
we must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
to do so  we analyze our historical experience related to product returns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns 
judgment must be used and estimates made in connection with establishing the allowance for product returns in any accounting period 
our allowances for product returns of approximately  and  are included as a reduction of accounts receivable at december  and  respectively 
should actual future returns vary significantly from our historical averages  our operating results could be affected 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
we experience some credit loss on our accounts receivable and accordingly we must make estimates related to the ultimate collection of our accounts receivable 
specifically  we analyze our accounts receivable  historical bad debt experience  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 

table of contents the majority of the company s receivables are from hospitals  many of which are government funded 
accordingly  the company s collection history with this class of customer has been favorable 
historically  the company has experienced minimal bad debts from its hospital customers and more significant bad debts from certain international distributors  typically as a result of specific financial difficulty or geo political factors 
the company writes off receivables when it determines that the receivables are uncollectible  typically upon customer bankruptcy or the customer s non response to continuous collection efforts 
we believe that the amount included in our allowance for doubtful accounts has been a historically accurate estimate of the amount of accounts receivable that are ultimately collected 
while we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate  the financial condition of our customers and the geo political factors that impact reimbursement under individual countries healthcare systems can change rapidly and as such  additional allowances may be required in future periods 
our accounts receivable balance for and was million and million  net of allowances for doubtful accounts of million and million  at december  and  respectively 
excess and obsolete inventories 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or its net realizable value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand for excess and obsolete inventory and  when circumstances indicate  we incur charges to write down inventories to their net realizable value 
our review of inventory for excess and obsolete quantities is based primarily on our forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twenty four months 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  our industry is characterized by regular new product development that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand due to cannibalization of existing products 
also  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may be required to incur charges for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if additional inventory write downs are required  we would recognize additional cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
regardless of changes in our estimates of future product demand  we do not increase the value of our inventory above its adjusted cost basis 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  significant unanticipated decreases in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
charges incurred for excess and obsolete inventory were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in  we incurred approximately million in charges within cost of sales to write down inventory to its net realizable value due to the termination of an agreement to distribute certain third party spinal products in europe 
in  charges incurred for excess and obsolete inventory included million recorded to write down certain foot and ankle implant inventory to its net realizable value as a result of our transition to our charlotte foot and ankle system 
goodwill and long lived assets 
we have approximately million of goodwill recorded as a result of the acquisition of businesses 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest that impairment exists 
based on our single business approach to decision making  planning  and resource allocation  we have determined that we have only one reporting unit for purposes of evaluating goodwill for impairment 
the annual evaluation of goodwill impairment may require the use of estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of our reporting unit using projections of future cash flows 
we performed our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of and determined that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and  therefore  no impairment charge was necessary 
our business is capital intensive  particularly as it relates to surgical instrumentation 
we depreciate our property  plant and equipment and amortize our intangible assets based upon our estimate of the respective asset s useful life 
our estimate of the useful life of an asset requires us to make judgments about future events  such as product life cycles  new product development  product cannibalization and technological obsolescence  as well as other 
table of contents competitive factors beyond our control 
we account for the impairment of long lived assets in accordance sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
accordingly  we evaluate impairments of our property  plant and equipment based upon an analysis of estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
if we determine that a change is required in the useful life of an asset  future depreciation amortization is adjusted accordingly 
alternatively  should we determine that an asset has been impaired  an adjustment would be charged to income based on its fair market value  or discounted cash flows if the fair market value is not readily determinable  reducing income in that period 
product liability claims and other litigation 
periodically  claims arise involving the use of our products 
we make provisions for claims specifically identified for which we believe the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and an estimate of the amount of loss has been developed 
we have recorded at least the minimum estimated liability related to those claims where a range of loss has been established 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the estimated liability related to our pending claims and make revisions as necessary 
future revisions in our estimates of the liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position 
we maintain insurance coverage that limits the severity of any single claim as well as total amounts incurred per policy year  and we believe our insurance coverage is adequate 
we use the best information available to us in determining the level of accrued product liabilities and we believe our accruals are adequate 
our accrual for product liability claims was approximately  and  at december  and  respectively 
during  we paid approximately  for claims which had been accrued as of december   and we reduced our accrual for specific claims for which we have met our insurance deductible 
we are also involved in legal proceedings as a plaintiff involving contract  patent protection and other matters 
we make provisions for claims specifically identified for which we believe the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and an estimate of the amount of loss has been developed 
accounting for income taxes 
our effective tax rate is based on income by tax jurisdiction  statutory rates and tax saving initiatives available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and evaluating our tax positions 
this process includes assessing temporary differences resulting from differing recognition of items for income tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits 
management evaluates deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provides valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have recorded valuation allowances of million and million as of december  and  respectively  due to uncertainties related to our ability to realize  before expiration  some of our deferred tax assets for both us and foreign income tax purposes 
these deferred tax assets primarily consist of the carry forward of certain net operating losses and general business tax credits 
we operate within numerous taxing jurisdictions 
we are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve 
management makes use of all available information and makes reasoned judgments regarding matters requiring interpretation in establishing tax expense  liabilities and reserves 
we believe adequate provisions exist for income taxes for all periods and jurisdictions subject to review or audit 
stock based compensation 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables  which include the expected life of the award  the expected stock price volatility over the expected life of the awards  expected dividend yield  and risk free interest rate 

table of contents we estimate the expected life of options by calculating the average of the vesting period and the contractual term of the option  as allowed by sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
we estimated expected stock price volatility based upon historical volatility of our common stock 
the risk free interest rate was determined using us treasury rates where the term is consistent with the expected life of the stock options 
expected dividend yield is not considered as we have never paid dividends and have no plans of doing so in the future 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
all stock options are amortized on a straight line basis over their respective requisite service periods  which are generally the vesting periods 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net income and net income per share 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable  characteristics not present in our option grants and employee stock purchase plan shares 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes and lattice binomial models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future 
certain stock based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that is significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
there is not currently a market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models

impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  by defining the criterion that an individual tax position must meet in order to be recognized in the financial statements 
fin requires that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained based solely on the technical merits as of the reporting date 
fin further requires that interest that the tax law requires to be paid on the underpayment of taxes should be accrued on the difference between the amount claimed or expected to be claimed on the return and the tax benefit recognized in the financial statements  which may be recorded as either income taxes or interest expense 
management has made the policy election to record this interest as interest expense 
fin also requires additional disclosures of unrecognized tax benefits  including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance 
we will comply with the provisions of fin effective january  we are currently assessing the impact that the adoption of fin will have on our results of operations and financial position 
as a result of the adoption of fin  the balance of certain of our liabilities for uncertain tax positions may change  which would be recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and foreign currencies could adversely affect our financial results 
approximately of our total net sales were denominated in foreign currencies during both of the years ended december  and  and we expect that foreign currencies will continue to represent a similarly significant percentage of our net sales in the future 
costs related to these sales are largely denominated in the same respective currencies  thereby limiting our transaction risk exposure 
however  for sales not denominated in us dollars  if there is an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency is exchanged for us dollars  it will require more of the foreign currency to equal a specified amount of us dollars than before the rate increase 
in such cases  if we price our products in the foreign currency  we will receive less in us dollars than we did before the rate increase went into effect 
if we price our products in us dollars and competitors price their products in local currency  an increase in the relative strength of the us dollar could result in our prices not being competitive in a market where business is transacted in the local currency 
a substantial majority of our sales denominated in foreign currencies are derived from eu countries and are denominated in the euro 
additionally  we have significant intercompany receivables from our foreign subsidiaries which are denominated in foreign currencies  principally the euro and the japanese yen 
our principal exchange rate risk  therefore  exists between the us dollar and the euro and the us dollar and the yen 
fluctuations from the beginning to the end of any given reporting period result in the revaluation of our foreign currency denominated intercompany receivables and payables  generating currency translation gains or losses that impact our non operating income and expense levels in the respective period 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements in financial statements and supplementary data  we enter into certain short term derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward contracts 
these forward contracts are designed to mitigate our exposure to currency fluctuations in our intercompany balances denominated in euros  japanese yen  british pounds and canadian dollars 
any change in the fair value of these forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be offset by a change in the value of the intercompany balance 
these contracts are effectively closed at the end of each reporting period
