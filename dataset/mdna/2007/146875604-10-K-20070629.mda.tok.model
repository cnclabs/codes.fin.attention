the bank finances its mortgage and loan products through its deposit operations or borrowings 
funds not used to originate mortgages and loans are invested primarily in us government agency securities and mortgage backed securities 
carver federal s primary market area for deposits consists of areas currently served by its ten branches 
the bank s branches are located in the brooklyn  manhattan and queens boroughs of new york city 
the neighborhoods in which the bank s branches are located have historically been low to moderate income areas 
however  the shortage of housing in new york city  combined with population shifts from the suburbs into the city  have combined to stimulate significant real estate and commercial development in the bank s market area 
the bank believes that the demographics of its primary market area are changing as a result of the increase in real estate development in recent years 
the expected change in income demographics supports the bank s strategy to provide commercial banking products through its acquisition of community capital bank ccb  and wealth management products through its affiliation with merrill lynch co 
carver federal s primary lending market includes bronx  kings  new york and queens counties in new york city  and lower westchester county  new york 
although carver federal s branches are primarily located in areas that were historically underserved by other financial institutions  the bank is facing increased competition for deposits and mortgage lending in its market areas 
management believes that this competition has become more intense as a result of the improving economic conditions in the bank s market area and an increased examination emphasis by federal banking regulators on financial institutions fulfillment of their responsibilities under the community reinvestment act cra 
the bank s competition for loans comes principally from mortgage banking companies  commercial banks  savings banks and savings and loan associations 
the bank s most direct competition for deposits comes from commercial banks  savings banks  savings and loan associations and credit unions 
competition for deposits also comes from money market mutual funds and other corporate and government securities funds as well as from other financial intermediaries such as brokerage firms and insurance companies 
many of carver federal s competitors have substantially greater resources and offer a wider array of financial services and products 
at times  these larger financial institutions may offer below market interest rates on mortgage loans and above market interest rates for deposits 
these pricing concessions combined with competitors larger presence in the new york market add to the challenges carver federal faces in expanding its current market share and growing its near term profitability 
carver federal s long history in its market area  its community involvement and relationships  targeted products and services and personal service consistent with community banking helps the bank compete with other competitors that have entered its market 
in addition  carver federal has successfully competed with larger financial institutions in a number of competitions for government grants and other awards 
in june  carver federal won a million new market tax credit nmtc award 
that amount compared favorably with awards won by substantially larger banks  including a million award for bank of america  million for citibank and million for jpmorgan chase 
carver federal believes its proven ability to deliver mainstream financial products and services in historically underserved markets well positions the bank to compete for awards under this and other programs designed to expand financial services in markets served by carver federal 
the bank s subsidiary  carver community development corporation ccdc  was formed to facilitate the bank s participation in local economic development and other community based activities 
as part of its operations  ccdc manages the million nmtc award

lending activities general 
carver federal engages in a number of lending activities including the origination or purchase of first mortgage loans for the purpose of purchasing or refinancing one to four family residential  multifamily  and commercial properties  the origination or participation in loans for the construction or renovation of commercial properties and residential housing developments  and permanent loan financing subsequent to the completion of existing construction lending  and the origination and participation in business loans primarily for small business entities 
first mortgage loan purchases during the fiscal year ended march  fiscal  accounted for of loan additions 
in order to achieve carver federal s loan growth objectives  loan purchases are made to supplement originations 
loan portfolio composition 
total loans receivable increased by million  or  to million at march  compared to million at march  carver federal s total loans receivable  net as a percentage of total assets increased to at march  compared to at march  one to four family mortgage loans totaled million  or of carver federal s total loan receivable  multifamily loans totaled million  or of total loans receivable  non residential real estate loans  which includes commercial and church loans  totaled million  or of total loans receivable  and construction loans net of committed but undisbursed funds  totaled million  or of total loans receivable 
business loans totaled million  or of total loans receivable 
consumer loans credit card loans  personal loans  and home improvement loans totaled million  or of total loans receivable 
carver federal pays a premium when the effective yield on the loans being purchased is greater than the current market rate for comparable loans 
these premiums are amortized as the loan is repaid 
it is possible that  in a declining interest rate environment  the rate or speed at which loans repay may increase which may have the effect of accelerating the amortization of the premium and therefore reducing the effective yield of the loan 
total premiums carver federal paid on purchased loans decreased by  or  to  at march  compared to million at march  the decrease was attributable to the amortization of premiums as loans pay down 
carver federal receives a discount when the effective yield on the loans being purchased is less than the current market rate for comparable loans 
certain fees net of origination expenses on originated loans are deferred and amortized over the life of the loan 
these discounts and net deferred fees are amortized as the loan is repaid 
it is possible that  in a rising interest rate environment  the rate or speed at which loans repay may decrease which may have the effect of de accelerating the amortization of the discounts and net deferred fees and therefore reducing the effective yield of the loan 
total discounts and deferred fees increased by  or  to  at march  compared to  at march  the decrease was primarily attributable to the amount of fees deferred on originated loans 
allowance for loan losses increased million to million at march  compared to million at march  the increase was primarily the result of the ccb acquisition 
in addition  the bank recorded a  provision for loan losses during fiscal during fiscal   in net charge offs were recorded

real estate loans one to four family multifamily non residential construction business consumer and other total loans receivable add premium on loans less deferred fees loan discounts allowance for loan losses total loans receivable  net includes personal  credit card  and home improvement one to four family residential lending 
traditionally  carver federal s lending activity has been the origination and purchase of loans secured by first mortgages on existing one to four family residences  although no one to four family loans were purchased in fiscal carver federal originates and purchases one to four family residential mortgage loans in amounts that usually range between  and  approximately of the one to four family residential mortgage loans maturing in greater than one year at march  were adjustable rate and approximately were fixed rate 
over fiscal  carver federal has shifted its efforts from primarily originating and purchasing one to four family residential loans to more profitable non residential and construction real estate loans 
in addition  as part of a balance sheet restructuring  the bank reclassified certain loans held in portfolio to held for sale and sold a portion of them 
these reasons primarily resulted in a million reduction in one to four family residential real estate loans to million or of total loans receivable  net 
carver federal s one to four family residential mortgage loans are generally for terms of years  amortized on a monthly basis  with principal and interest due each month 
residential mortgage loans often remain outstanding for significantly shorter periods than their contractual terms 
these loans customarily contain due on sale clauses that permit the bank to accelerate repayment of a loan upon transfer of ownership of the mortgaged property 
also  borrowers may refinance or prepay one to four family residential loans at their option without penalty 
the bank s lending policies generally limit the maximum loan to value ltv ratio on one to four family residential mortgage loans secured by owner occupied properties to of the lesser of the appraised value or purchase price  with private mortgage insurance required on loans with ltv ratios in excess of 
under certain special loan programs  carver federal may originate and sell loans secured by single family homes purchased by first time home buyers where the ltv ratio may be up to 
carver federal s fixed rate  one to four family residential mortgage loans are underwritten in accordance with applicable secondary market underwriting guidelines and requirements for sale 
from time to time the bank has sold such loans to federal national mortgage association fnma  the state of new york mortgage agency sonyma and other third parties 
loans are generally sold with limited recourse on a servicing retained basis except to sonyma where the sale is made with servicing released 
carver federal uses several servicing firms to sub service mortgage loans  whether held in portfolio or sold with the servicing retained 
at march   the bank  through its sub servicers  serviced million in loans for fnma and million for other third parties 
from time to time carver federal purchases one to four family loans  which have included interest only loans 
in an effort to maximize asset quality and consistent with cautionary advice offered to the thrift industry by the office of thrift supervision  during the fiscal year  carver federal transferred a portion of the bank s interest only loans to held for sale 
carver federal no longer purchases or originates such loans for portfolio 

table of contents carver federal offers one year  three year  five one year and five three year adjustable rate one to four family residential mortgage loans 
these loans are generally retained in carver federal s portfolio although they may be sold in the secondary market 
they are indexed to the weekly average rate on one year  three year and five year us treasury securities  respectively  adjusted to a constant maturity usually one year  plus a margin 
the rates at which interest accrues on these loans are adjustable every one  three or five years  generally with limitations on adjustments of two percentage points per adjustment period and six percentage points over the life of a one year adjustable rate mortgage and four percentage points over the life of three year and five year adjustable rate mortgages 
the retention of adjustable rate loans in carver federal s portfolio helps reduce carver federal s exposure to increases in prevailing market interest rates 
however  there are unquantifiable credit risks resulting from potential increases in costs to borrowers in the event of upward repricing of adjustable rate loans 
it is possible that during periods of rising interest rates  the risk of default on adjustable rate loans may increase due to increases in interest costs to borrowers 
although adjustable rate loans allow the bank to increase the sensitivity of its interest earning assets to changes in interest rates  the extent of this interest rate sensitivity is limited by periodic and lifetime interest rate adjustment limitations 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that yields on the bank s adjustable rate loans will fully adjust to compensate for increases in the bank s cost of funds 
adjustable rate loans increase the bank s exposure to decreases in prevailing market interest rates  although decreases in the bank s cost of funds would tend to offset this effect 
multifamily real estate lending 
traditionally  carver federal originates and purchases multifamily loans  although no multifamily loans were purchased in fiscal rates offered on this product are considered to be competitive with flexible terms that make this product attractive to borrowers 
multifamily property lending entails additional risks compared to one to four family residential lending 
for example  such loans are dependent on the successful operation of such buildings and can be significantly impacted by supply and demand conditions in the market for multifamily residential units 
the multifamily portfolio decreased during fiscal at march   multifamily loans totaled million  or of carver federal s total loans receivable  net 
carver federal s multifamily product guidelines generally require that the maximum ltv not exceed based on the appraised value of the mortgaged property 
the bank generally requires a debt service coverage ratio dscr of at least on multifamily loans  which requires the properties to generate cash flow after expenses and allowances in excess of the principal and interest payment 
carver federal originates and purchases multifamily mortgage loans  which are predominantly adjustable rate loans that generally amortize on the basis of a   or year period and require a balloon payment after the first five years  or the borrower may have an option to extend the loan for two additional five year periods 
the bank  on a case by case basis  originates ten year fixed rate loans 
to help ensure continued collateral protection and asset quality for the term of multifamily real estate loans  carver federal employs a loan risk rating system 
under the risk rating system  all commercial real estate loans are risk rated internally at the time of origination 
in addition  to evaluate changes in the credit profile of the borrower and the underlying collateral  an independent consulting firm reviews and prepares a written report for a sample of multifamily real estate loan relationships of  to million  and at least semiannually prepares a written report for all relationships exceeding million 
summary reports are then reviewed by the internal asset review committee for changes in the credit profile of individual borrowers and the portfolio as a whole 
non residential real estate lending 
carver federal s non residential real estate lending activity consists predominantly of originating loans for the purpose of purchasing or refinancing office  mixed use properties used for both commercial and residential purposes but predominantly commercial  retail and church buildings in its market area 
carver federal acquired million in non residential loans  excluding purchase accounting discount  with the acquisition of ccb 
ccb s underwriting standards were comparable to carver federal s 
non residential real estate lending entails additional risks compared with one to four family residential and multifamily lending 
for example  such loans typically involve large loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers  and the payment experience on such loans typically is dependent on the successful operation of the commercial property 
carver federal s maximum ltv on non residential real estate mortgage loans is generally based on the appraised value of the mortgaged property 
the bank generally requires a dscr of at least on non residential real estate loans 
the bank requires the assignment of rents of all tenants leases in the mortgaged property  which serves as additional security for the mortgage loan 
at march   non residential real estate mortgage loans totaled million  or of the total loans receivable  net 
this balance also reflects a year over year increase of million which is in line with the bank s objective of investing in higher yielding loans 
all non residential real estate loans are risk rated internally at the time of origination 
at least semi annually  an independent consulting firm risk rates and prepares written summary reports for all relationships exceeding million and a statistical sampling of loans  to million 
historically  carver federal has been a new york city metropolitan area leader in the origination of loans to churches 
at march   loans to churches totaled million  or of the bank s gross loan portfolio 
these loans generally have five  seven or ten year terms with  or year amortization periods and a balloon payment due at the end of the term and generally have no greater than a ltv ratio 
the bank provides construction financing for churches and generally provides permanent financing upon completion of construction 
there are currently church loans in the bank s loan portfolio 

table of contents loans secured by real estate owned by faith based organizations generally are larger and involve greater risks than one to four family residential mortgage loans 
because payments on loans secured by such properties are often dependent on voluntary contributions by members of the church s congregation  repayment of such loans may be subject to a greater extent to adverse conditions in the economy 
the bank seeks to minimize these risks in a variety of ways  including reviewing the organization s financial condition  limiting the size of such loans and establishing the quality of the collateral securing such loans 
the bank determines the appropriate amount and type of security for such loans based in part upon the governance structure of the particular organization  the length of time the church has been established in the community and a cash flow analysis of the church to determine its ability to service the proposed loan 
carver federal will obtain a first mortgage on the underlying real property and often requires personal guarantees of key members of the congregation and or key person life insurance on the pastor of the congregation 
the bank may also require the church to obtain key person life insurance on specific members of the church s leadership 
asset quality in the church loan category has been strong throughout carver federal s history 
management believes that carver federal remains a leading lender to churches in its market area 
construction lending 
the bank originates or participates in construction loans for new construction and renovation of churches  multifamily buildings  residential developments  community service facilities and affordable housing programs 
carver federal acquired million in construction loans with the acquisition of ccb 
ccb s underwriting standards were comparable to carver federal 
carver federal also offers construction loans to qualified individuals and developers for new construction and renovation of one to four family  multifamily or mixed use and commercial real estate in the bank s market area 
the bank s construction loans generally have adjustable interest rates and are underwritten in accordance with the same standards as the bank s mortgage loans on existing properties 
the loans provide for disbursement in stages as construction is completed 
participation in construction loans may be at various stages of funding 
construction terms are usually from to months 
the construction loan interest is capitalized as part of the overall project cost and is funded monthly from the loan proceeds 
borrowers must satisfy all credit requirements that apply to the bank s permanent mortgage loan financing for the mortgaged property 
carver federal has established additional criteria for construction loans to include an engineer s plan and cost review on all construction budgets with appropriate interest reserves for loans in excess of  construction financing generally is considered to involve a higher degree of risk of loss than long term financing on improved and occupied real estate 
risk of loss on a construction loan is dependent largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the mortgaged property s value at completion of construction or development and the estimated cost including interest of construction 
during the construction phase  a number of factors could result in project delays and cost overruns 
if the estimate of construction costs proves to be inaccurate  the bank may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the development 
if the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate  the bank may be confronted  at or prior to the maturity of the loan  with a project having a value that is insufficient to assure full repayment of such loan 
the ability of a developer to sell developed lots or completed dwelling units will depend on  among other things  demand  pricing  availability of comparable properties and economic conditions 
the bank has sought to minimize this risk by limiting construction lending to qualified borrowers in the bank s market areas  limiting the aggregate amount of outstanding construction loans and imposing a stricter ltv ratio requirement than that required for one to four family mortgage loans 
at march   the bank had million net of million of committed but undisbursed funds in construction loans outstanding  comprising of the bank s total loans receivable  net 
the balance at march  reflects a million  or  increase over fiscal year ended march  fiscal  consistent with management s objective to add higher yielding loans to portfolio 
purchased construction loans represent of total construction loans in portfolio 
the bank s primary source of construction loan purchases is community preservation corporation  a private not for profit corporation sponsored by more than commercial banks  savings institutions and insurance companies that provides mortgage  construction and other lending for the housing needs with the goal to revitalize low and mixed income communities 
business loans 
carver federal acquired a small business lending portfolio  consisting of approximately loans totaling approximately million  excluding the discount to fair market value at acquisition  increasing the portfolio to million or of total loans receivable  net 
carver federal provides revolving credit and term loan facilities to small businesses with annual sales of approximately million to million in manufacturing  services and wholesale segments 
during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended march   carver federal s board of directors the board approved the bank to provide back up liquidity for highly rated us corporate commercial paper borrowers with a minimum short term debt rating of a p cp back up where a minority bank is the administrative agent and is syndicated entirely to a minority bank group 
as of march   the bank had entered into two minority bank cp back up facilities  one for million with a aaa rated us corporate borrower and one for million with an a rated us corporate borrower 
the facilities are not expected to be drawn as they provide alternate liquidity to the borrowers and the bank is paid a commitment fee for this product 

table of contents consumer loans 
at march   the bank had million in consumer loans  or of the bank s gross loan portfolio 
at march    or of the bank s consumer loans  were unsecured loans  consisting of all consumer loans other than loans secured by savings deposits  and  or  were secured by savings deposits 
at the end of the fiscal year ended march  fiscal the bank froze all undrawn available credit lines on its credit card product in an effort to terminate this product and collect repayments on outstanding balances and related finance charges 
effective march   all unsecured credit card accounts were converted to fixed rate installment loans with an amortization period not to exceed months 
consumer loans generally involve more risk than first mortgage loans 
collection of a delinquent loan is dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability  and thus is more likely to be adversely affected by job loss  divorce  illness or personal bankruptcy 
further  the application of various federal and state laws  including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws  may limit the amount which can be recovered 
these loans may also give rise to claims and defenses by a borrower against carver federal  and a borrower may be able to assert claims and defenses against carver federal which it has against the seller of the underlying collateral 
in underwriting unsecured consumer loans other than secured credit cards  carver federal considers the borrower s credit history  an analysis of the borrower s income  expenses and ability to repay the loan and the value of the collateral 
the underwriting for secured credit cards only takes into consideration the value of the underlying collateral 
see asset quality non performing assets 
loan processing 
carver federal s loan originations are derived from a number of sources  including referrals by realtors  builders  depositors  borrowers and mortgage brokers  as well as walk in customers 
loans are originated by the bank s personnel who receive a base salary  commissions and other incentive compensation 
loan application forms are available at each of the bank s offices 
all real estate  business and unsecured loan applications are forwarded to the bank s lending department for underwriting pursuant to standards established in carver federal s loan policy 
the underwriting and loan processing for residential loans is initiated internally but undergoes subsequent review by an outsourced third party provider for loans with ltv ratios greater than that require private mortgage insurance 
a commercial real estate loan application is completed for all multifamily and non residential properties which the bank finances 
prior to loan approval  the property is inspected by a loan officer 
as part of the loan approval process  consideration is given to an independent appraisal  location  accessibility  stability of the neighborhood  environmental assessment  personal credit history of the applicant s and the financial capacity of the applicant s 
business loan applications are completed for all business loans 
most business loans are secured by real estate  guaranteed by the sba or ucc filings 
the loan approval process considers the credit history of the applicant  collateral  cash flows and purpose and stability of the business 
upon receipt of a completed loan application from a prospective borrower  a credit report and other verifications are ordered to confirm specific information relating to the loan applicant s income and credit standing 
it is the bank s policy to obtain an appraisal of the real estate intended to secure a proposed mortgage loan from an independent appraiser approved by the bank 
it is carver federal s policy to record a lien on the real estate securing the loan and to obtain a title insurance policy that insures that the property is free of prior encumbrances 
borrowers must also obtain hazard insurance policies prior to closing and  when the property is in a flood plain as designated by the department of housing and urban development  paid flood insurance policies must be obtained 
most borrowers are also required to advance funds on a monthly basis  together with each payment of principal and interest  to a mortgage escrow account from which the bank makes disbursements for items such as real estate taxes and hazard insurance 
written conformation of the guarantee for sba loans and evidence of the ucc filing is also required 
loan approval 
except for real estate and business loans in excess of million and million  respectively  mortgage and business loan approval authority has been delegated by the bank s board to the board s asset liability and interest rate risk committee 
the asset liability and interest rate risk committee has delegated to the bank s management loan committee  which consists of certain members of executive management  loan approval authority for loans up to and including million for real estate loans  million for business loans secured by real estate and million for all other business loans 
all one to four family mortgage loans that conform to fnma standards and limits may be approved by the residential mortgage loan underwriter 
any loan that represents an exception to the bank s lending policies must be ratified by the next higher approval authority 
real estate and business loans above million and million  respectively  must be approved by the full board 
purchased loans are subject to the same approval process as originated loans 
loans to one borrower 
under the loans to one borrower limits of the ots  with certain limited exceptions  loans and extensions of credit to a single or related group of borrowers outstanding at one time generally may not exceed of the unimpaired capital and surplus of a savings bank 
see regulation and supervision federal banking regulation loans to one borrower limitations 
at march   the maximum loans to one borrower under this test would be million and the bank had no relationships that exceeded this limit 

table of contents loan sales 
originations of one to four family real estate loans are generally made on properties located within the new york city metropolitan area  although carver federal occasionally funds loans secured by property in other areas 
all such loans  however  satisfy the bank s underwriting criteria regardless of location 
the bank continues to offer one to four family fixed rate mortgage loans in response to consumer demand but requires that such loans satisfy applicable secondary market guidelines of either fnma  sonyma or other third party purchaser to provide opportunity for subsequent sale in the secondary market as desired to manage interest rate risk exposure 
loan originations and purchases 
loan originations  including originated for sale  were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in the fiscal year ended march  fiscal 
the increase in loan originations in fiscal can be attributed to strong market conditions and the bank s commitment to increasing its market share 
the bank acquired ccb in fiscal with gross loans of million 
the market continues to be challenging as new lenders enter the already fiercely competitive marketplace 
during fiscal  carver federal purchased a total of million of mortgage loans  consisting of performing  construction and non residential mortgage loans and business loans to supplement its origination efforts 
this represented of carver federal s purchases and originations of its loan portfolio during fiscal the bank purchases loans in order to increase interest income and to manage its liquidity position 
the bank continues to shift its loan production emphasis to take advantage of the higher yields and better interest rate risk characteristics available on business loans  multifamily and non residential real estate mortgage loans  including those in construction  as well as to increase its participation in multifamily and non residential real estate mortgage loans with other new york metropolitan area lenders 
loans purchased in fiscal decreased million  or  from loan purchases of million during fiscal due to the bank s focus on originating and purchasing higher yielding loans 
the following table sets forth certain information with respect to carver federal s loan originations  purchases and sales for the years ended march dollars in thousands amount percent amount percent amount percent loans originated one to four family multifamily non residential construction business consumer and others total loans originated loans purchased loans sold net additions to loan portfolio comprised of business lines of credit  personal  auto  credit card and home equity loans 
comprised of primarily construction and non residential mortgage loans and business loans 
comprised of primarily one to four family mortgage loans 
loans purchased by the bank entail certain risks not necessarily associated with loans the bank originates 
the bank s purchased loans are generally acquired without recourse  with certain exceptions related to the seller s compliance with representations and warranties  and in accordance with the bank s underwriting criteria for originations 
in addition  purchased loans have a variety of terms  including maturities  interest rate caps and indices for adjustment of interest rates  that may differ from those offered at the time by the bank in connection with the loans the bank originates 
the bank initially seeks to purchase loans in its market area  however  the bank will purchase loans secured by property secured outside its market area to meet its financial objectives 
the market areas in which the properties that secure the purchased loans are located may differ from carver federal s market area and may be subject to economic and real estate market conditions that may significantly differ from those experienced in carver federal s market area 
there can be no assurance that economic conditions in these out of state areas will not deteriorate in the future  resulting in increased loan delinquencies and loan losses among the loans secured by property in these areas 
during fiscal  the properties securing purchased loans were concentrated primarily in new york 
in an effort to reduce these risks  the bank has sought to ensure that purchased loans satisfy the bank s underwriting standards and do not otherwise have a higher risk of collection or loss than loans originated by the bank 
a review of each purchased loan is conducted  and the bank also requires appropriate documentation and further seeks to reduce its risk by requiring  in each buy sell agreement  a series of warranties and representations as to the underwriting standards and the enforceability of the related legal documents 
these warranties and representations remain in effect for the life of the loan 
any misrepresentation must be cured within days of discovery or trigger certain repurchase provisions in the buy sell agreement

carver federal determines the interest rates that it charges on loans primarily by comparison of competitive loan rates offered in its market area and by examining the minimum yield requirements for loans purchased by secondary market sources 
loan rates reflect factors such as prevailing market interest rate levels  the supply of money available to the banking industry and the demand for such loans 
these factors are in turn affected by general economic conditions  the monetary policies of the federal government  including the board of governors of the federal reserve system the frb  the general supply of money in the economy  tax policies and governmental budget matters 
carver federal charges fees in connection with loan commitments and originations  rate lock ins  loan modifications  late payments  changes of property ownership and for miscellaneous services related to its loans 
loan origination fees are calculated as a percentage of the loan principal 
the bank typically receives fees of between zero and one point one point being equivalent to of the principal amount of the loan in connection with the origination of fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgage loans 
the loan origination fee  net of certain direct loan origination expenses  is deferred and accreted into income over the estimated life of the loan using the interest method 
if a loan is prepaid or sold all remaining deferred fees with respect to such loan are taken into income at such time 
in addition to the foregoing fees  carver federal receives fees for servicing mortgage loans for others  which in turn generally are sub serviced for carver federal by a third party servicer 
servicing activities include the collection and processing of mortgage payments  accounting for loan repayment funds and paying real estate taxes  hazard insurance and other loan related expenses out of escrowed funds 
income from these activities varies from period to period with the volume and type of loans originated  sold and purchased  which in turn is dependent on prevailing market interest rates and their affect on the demand for loans in the bank s market area 
carver federal also receives fees for servicing sba loans 
servicing activities include collection and processing of payments  accounting for loan repayment funds and sba servicing and reporting requirements 
loan maturity schedule 
the following table sets forth information at march  regarding the amount of loans maturing in carver federal s portfolio  including scheduled repayments of principal  based on contractual terms to maturity 
demand loans  loans having no schedule of repayments and no stated maturity  and overdrafts are reported as due in one year or less

scheduled contractual principal repayments of loans do not necessarily reflect the actual lives of such assets 
the average life of long term loans is substantially less than their contractual terms due to prepayments 
in addition  due on sale clauses in mortgage loans generally give carver federal the right to declare a conventional loan due and payable in the event  among other things  that a borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid 
the average life of mortgage loans tends to increase when current mortgage loan market rates are substantially higher than rates on existing mortgage loans and tends to decrease when current mortgage loan market rates are substantially lower than rates on existing mortgage loans in thousands 
table of contents due after march  fixed adjustable total real estate loans one to four family multifamily non residential construction business consumer total asset quality general 
one of the bank s key operating objectives continues to be to maintain a high level of asset quality 
through a variety of strategies  including  but not limited to  monitoring loan delinquencies and borrower workout arrangements  the bank has been proactive in addressing problem and non performing assets which  in turn  has helped to build the strength of the bank s financial condition 
such strategies  as well as the bank s concentration on one to four family  commercial mortgage lending which includes multifamily and non residential real estate loans  construction lending and business loans mostly secured by real estate and the sba  the maintenance of sound credit standards for new loan originations and a strong real estate market  have resulted in the bank maintaining a low level of non performing assets 
the underlying credit quality of the bank s loan portfolio is dependent primarily on each borrower s ability to continue to make required loan payments and  in the event a borrower is unable to continue to do so  the adequacy of the value of the collateral securing the loan 
a borrower s ability to pay typically is dependent primarily on employment and other sources of income  which  in turn  is impacted by general economic conditions  although other factors  such as unanticipated expenditures or changes in the financial markets  may also impact the borrower s ability to pay 
collateral values  particularly real estate values  are also impacted by a variety of factors  including general economic conditions  demographics  maintenance and collection or foreclosure delays 
non performing assets 
when a borrower fails to make a payment on a loan  immediate steps are taken by carver federal and its sub servicers to have the delinquency cured and the loan restored to current status 
with respect to mortgage loans  once the payment grace period has expired in most instances days after the due date  a late notice is mailed to the borrower within two business days and a late charge is imposed  if applicable 
if payment is not promptly received  the borrower is contacted by telephone and efforts are made to formulate an affirmative plan to cure the delinquency 
additional calls are made by the th and th day of the delinquency 
if a mortgage loan becomes days delinquent  a letter is mailed to the borrower requesting payment by a specified date 
if a mortgage loan becomes days delinquent  carver federal seeks to make personal contact with the borrower and also has the property inspected 
if a mortgage becomes days delinquent  a letter is sent to the borrower demanding payment by a certain date and indicating that a foreclosure suit will be filed if the deadline is not met 
if payment is still not made  the bank may pursue foreclosure or other appropriate action 
in the case of business loans the collection process is similar 
the bank may pursue foreclosure or other appropriate action for business loans secured by real estate 
for business loans not secured by real estate  the bank may seek the sba guarantee or other appropriate action 
when a borrower fails to make a payment on a consumer loan  steps are taken by carver federal s loan servicing department to have the delinquency cured and the loan restored to current status 
once the payment grace period has expired days after the due date  a late notice is mailed to the borrower immediately and a late charge is imposed  if applicable 
if payment is not promptly received  the borrower is contacted by telephone  and efforts are made to formulate an affirmative plan to cure the delinquency 
if a consumer loan becomes days delinquent  a letter is mailed to the borrower requesting payment by a specified date 
if the loan becomes days delinquent  the account is given to an independent collection agency to follow up with the collection of the account 
if the loan becomes days delinquent  a final warning letter is sent to the borrower and any co borrower 
if the loan remains delinquent  it is reviewed for charge off 
the bank s collection efforts generally continue after the loan is charged off 

table of contents the following table sets forth information with respect to carver federal s non performing assets as of march dollars in thousands loans accounted for on a non accrual basis real estate one to four family multifamily non residential construction business consumer total non accrual loans accruing loans contractually past due days total non accrual accruing loans past due days other non performing assets real estate land total other non performing assets total non performing assets non performing loans to total loans non performing assets to total assets non accrual status denotes any loan where the delinquency exceeds days past due and in the opinion of management the collection of additional interest is doubtful 
payments received on a non accrual loan are either applied to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income  depending on assessment of the ability to collect on the loan 
other non performing assets generally represent property acquired by the bank in settlement of loans ie  through foreclosure  repossession or as an in substance foreclosure 
these assets are recorded at the lower of their fair value or the cost to acquire 
total non performing assets consist of non accrual loans  accruing loans days or more past due  property acquired in settlement of loans 
at march   total non performing assets increased by million to million  compared to million at march  at march   other non performing assets consists of a  parcel of land that carver federal acquired as a result of a property tax redemption 
the increase in non accrual loans reflects a million group of loans to one borrower that were restructured and was partially offset by non performing loans that were paid off and payments on other loans which returned them to performing status 
there were no accruing loans contractually past due days or more at march  and march   reflecting the continued practice adopted by the bank during the fiscal year ended march  to either write off or place on non accrual status all loans contractually past due days or more 
asset classification and allowances for losses 
federal regulations and the bank s policies require the classification of assets on the basis of credit quality on a quarterly basis 
an asset is classified as substandard if it is determined to be inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the current value of the collateral pledged  if any 
an asset is classified as doubtful if full collection is highly questionable or improbable 
an asset is classified as loss if it is considered un collectible  even if a partial recovery could be expected in the future 
the regulations also provide for a special mention designation  described as assets that do not currently expose a savings institution to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification but do possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving management s close attention 
assets classified as substandard or doubtful require a savings institution to establish general allowances for loan losses 
if an asset or portion thereof is classified as a loss  a savings institution must either establish specific allowances for loan losses in the amount of the portion of the asset classified loss or charge off such amount 
federal examiners may disagree with a savings institution s classifications 
if a savings institution does not agree with an examiner s classification of an asset  it may appeal this determination to the ots regional director 

table of contents at march   carver federal had million of loans classified as substandard  representing of the bank s total assets 
as of march   the bank had million of loans classified as substandard  representing of the bank s total assets 
this increase results primarily from a million group of loans to one borrower that were restructured and classified during the year and million in classified business loans acquired with ccb 
there were  and  in loans classified as doubtful and loss  respectively  at march  as compared to no loans classified as doubtful or loss at march  the ots  in conjunction with the other federal banking agencies  has adopted an interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan losses and lease losses 
the policy statement provides guidance for financial institutions on both the responsibilities of management for the assessment and establishment of adequate allowances and guidance for banking agency examiners to use in determining the adequacy of general valuation guidelines 
generally  the policy statement recommends that institutions have effective systems and controls to identify  monitor and address asset quality problems  that management analyze all significant factors that affect the ability to collect the portfolio in a reasonable manner and that management establish acceptable allowance evaluation processes that meet the objectives set forth in the policy statement 
although management believes that adequate specific and general loan loss allowances have been established  actual losses are dependent upon future events and  as such  further additions to the level of specific and general loan loss allowances may become necessary 
federal examiners may disagree with the savings institution as to the appropriate level of the institution s allowance for loan losses 
while management believes carver federal has established its existing loss allowances in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  there can be no assurance that regulators  in reviewing carver federal s assets  will not require carver federal to increase its loss allowance  thereby negatively affecting carver federal s reported financial condition and results of operations 
carver federal s methodology for establishing the allowance for loan losses takes into consideration probable losses that have been identified in connection with specific loans as well as losses that have not been identified but can be expected to occur 
further  management reviews the ratio of allowances to total loans including projected growth and recommends adjustments to the level of allowances accordingly 
the internal asset review committee conducts reviews of the bank s loans on at least a quarterly basis and evaluates the need to establish general and specific allowances on the basis of this review 
in addition  management actively monitors carver federal s asset quality and charges off loans and properties acquired in settlement of loans against the allowances for losses on loans and such properties when appropriate and provides specific loss reserves when necessary 
although management believes it uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the allowances for losses  future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the economic conditions in the assumptions used in making the initial determinations 
additionally  the internal asset review committee reviews carver federal s assets on a quarterly basis to determine whether any assets require classification or re classification 
the bank has a centralized loan servicing structure that relies upon outside servicers  each of which generates a monthly report of delinquent loans 
the board has designated the internal asset review committee to perform quarterly reviews of the bank s asset quality  and their report is submitted to the board for review 
the asset liability and interest rate risk committee of the board establishes policy relating to internal classification of loans and also provides input to the internal asset review committee in its review of classified assets 
in originating loans  carver federal recognizes that credit losses will occur and that the risk of loss will vary with  among other things  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan  general economic conditions and  in the case of a secured loan  the quality of the security for the loan 
it is management s policy to maintain a general allowance for loan losses based on  among other things  regular reviews of delinquencies and loan portfolio quality  character and size  the bank s and the industry s historical and projected loss experience and current and forecasted economic conditions 
in addition  considerable uncertainty exists as to the future improvement or deterioration of the real estate markets in various states  or of their ultimate impact on carver federal as a result of its purchased loans in such states 
see lending activities loan purchases and originations 
carver federal increases its allowance for loan losses by charging provisions for possible losses against the bank s income 
general allowances are established by the board on at least a quarterly basis based on an assessment of risk in the bank s loans  taking into consideration the composition and quality of the portfolio  delinquency trends  current charge off and loss experience  the state of the real estate market and economic conditions generally 
specific allowances are provided for individual loans  or portions of loans  when ultimate collection is considered improbable by management based on the current payment status of the loan and the fair value or net realizable value of the security for the loan 
at the date of foreclosure or other repossession or at the date the bank determines a property is an impaired property  the bank transfers the property to real estate acquired in settlement of loans at the lower of cost or fair value  less estimated selling costs 
fair value is defined as the amount in cash or cash equivalent value of other consideration that a real estate parcel would yield in a current sale between a willing buyer and a willing seller 
any amount of cost in excess of fair value is charged off against the allowance for loan losses 
carver federal records an allowance for estimated selling costs of the property immediately after foreclosure 
subsequent to acquisition  management periodically evaluates the property and an allowance is established if the estimated fair value of the property  less estimated costs to sell  declines 
if  upon ultimate disposition of the property  net sales proceeds exceed the net carrying value of the property  a gain on sale of real estate is recorded 
at march   the bank had no foreclosed real estate  however  as a result of a property tax redemption  the bank took fee ownership of a vacant tract of land in bayshore  ny

table of contents investment activities general 
the bank utilizes mortgage backed and other investment securities in its asset liability management strategy 
in making investment decisions  the bank considers  among other things  its yield and interest rate objectives  its interest rate and credit risk position and its liquidity and cash flow 
generally  the investment policy of the bank is to invest funds among categories of investments and maturities based upon the bank s asset liability management policies  investment quality  loan and deposit volume and collateral requirements  liquidity needs and performance objectives 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  requires that securities be classified into three categories trading  held to maturity  and available for sale 
securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 
debt securities for which the bank has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and reported at amortized cost 
all other securities not classified as trading or held to maturity are classified as available for sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included  on an after tax basis  in a separate component of stockholders equity 
at march   the bank had no securities classified as trading 
at march   million  or of the bank s mortgage backed and other investment securities  was classified as available for sale 
the remaining million  or  was classified as held to maturity 
mortgage backed securities 
the bank has invested in mortgage backed securities in order to achieve its asset liability management goals and collateral needs 
although mortgage backed securities generally yield less than whole loans  they present substantially lower credit risk  are more liquid than individual mortgage loans and may be used to collateralize obligations of the bank 
because carver federal receives regular payments of principal and interest from its mortgage backed securities  these investments provide more consistent cash flows than investments in other debt securities  which generally only pay principal at maturity 
mortgage backed securities also help the bank meet certain definitional tests for favorable treatment under federal banking and tax laws 
see regulation and supervision federal banking regulation qtl test and federal and state taxation 
at march   mortgage backed securities constituted of total assets  as compared to of total assets at march  carver federal maintains a portfolio of mortgage backed securities in the form of government national mortgage association gnma pass through certificates  fnma and fhlmc participation certificates 
gnma pass through certificates are guaranteed as to the payment of principal and interest by the full faith and credit of the united states government while fnma and fhlmc certificates are each guaranteed by their respective agencies as to principal and interest 
mortgage backed securities generally entitle carver federal to receive a pro rata portion of the cash flows from an identified pool of mortgages 
the cash flows from such pools are segmented and paid in accordance with a predetermined priority to various classes of securities issued by the entity 
carver federal has also invested in pools of loans guaranteed as to principal and interest by the small business administration sba 
the bank seeks to manage interest rate risk by investing in adjustable rate mortgage backed securities  which at march   constituted million  or  of the mortgage backed securities portfolio 
mortgage backed securities  however  expose carver federal to certain unique risks 
in a declining rate environment  accelerated prepayments of loans underlying these securities expose carver federal to the risk that it will be unable to obtain comparable yields upon reinvestment of the proceeds 
in the event the mortgage backed security has been funded with an interest bearing liability with maturity comparable to the original estimated life of the mortgage backed security  the bank s interest rate spread could be adversely affected 
conversely  in a rising interest rate environment  the bank may experience a lower than estimated rate of repayment on the underlying mortgages  effectively extending the estimated life of the mortgage backed security and exposing the bank to the risk that it may be required to fund the asset with a liability bearing a higher rate of interest

the table above does not consider the effects of possible prepayments or unscheduled repayments 
other investment securities 
in addition to mortgage backed securities  the bank also invests in high quality assets primarily government and agency obligations with short and intermediate terms typically seven years or less to maturity 
carver federal is permitted under federal law to make certain investments  including investments in securities issued by various federal agencies and state and municipal governments  deposits at the fhlb ny  certificates of deposit in federally insured institutions  certain bankers acceptances and federal funds 
the bank may also invest  subject to certain limitations  in commercial paper having one of the two highest investment ratings of a nationally recognized credit rating agency  and certain other types of corporate debt securities and mutual funds

deposit activity and other sources of funds general 
deposits are the primary source of carver federal s funds for lending and other investment purposes 
in addition to deposits  carver federal derives funds from loan principal repayments  loan and investment interest payments  maturing investments and fee income 
loan and mortgage backed securities repayments and interest payments are a relatively stable source of funds  while deposit inflows and outflows are significantly influenced by prevailing market interest rates  pricing of deposits  competition and general economic conditions 
borrowed money may be used to supplement the bank s available funds  and from time to time the bank borrows funds from the fhlb ny and has borrowed funds through repurchase agreements and trust preferred debt securities

deposits are the primary source of funds for carver federal s lending  investment and general operating activities 
carver federal is authorized  however  to use advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase repos from the fhlb ny and approved primary dealers to supplement its supply of funds and to meet deposit withdrawal requirements 
the fhlb ny functions as a central bank providing credit for savings institutions and certain other member financial institutions 
as a member of the federal home loan bank fhlb system  carver federal is required to own stock in the fhlb ny and is authorized to apply for advances 
advances are made pursuant to several different programs  each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities 
advances from the fhlb ny are secured by carver federal s stock in the fhlb ny and a pledge of carver federal s mortgage loan and mortgage backed securities portfolios

the bank s deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic under the deposit insurance fund dif  and it is a member of the fhlb 
the bank must file reports with the ots concerning its activities and financial condition  and it must obtain regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions  such as mergers with  or acquisitions of  other depository institutions 
the holding company  as a unitary savings and loan holding company  is subject to regulation  examination and supervision by the ots and is required to file certain reports with  and otherwise comply with  the rules and regulations of the ots and of the securities and exchange commission the sec under the federal securities laws 
the ots and the fdic periodically perform safety and soundness examinations of the bank and the holding company and test our compliance with various regulatory requirements 
the ots has primary enforcement responsibility over federally chartered savings banks and has substantial discretion to impose enforcement action on an institution that fails to comply with applicable regulatory requirements  particularly with respect to its capital requirements 
in addition  the fdic has the authority to recommend to the director of the ots that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular federally chartered savings bank and  if action is not taken by the director  the fdic has authority to take such action under certain circumstances 

table of contents this regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework to regulate and control the activities in which an institution can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors 
this structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies  including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes 
any change in such laws and regulations whether by the ots  the fdic or through legislation could have a material adverse impact on the bank and the holding company and their operations and stockholders 
the description of statutory provisions and regulations applicable to federally chartered savings banks and their holding companies and of tax matters set forth in this document does not purport to be a complete description of all such statutes and regulations and their effects on the bank and the holding company 
federal banking regulation activity powers 
the bank derives its lending and investment powers from the home owners loan act hola  as amended  and the regulations of the ots 
under these laws and regulations  the bank may invest in mortgage loans secured by residential and commercial real estate  commercial and consumer loans  certain types of debt securities and certain other assets 
the bank may also establish service corporations that may engage in activities not otherwise permissible for the bank  including certain real estate equity investments and securities and insurance brokerage 
the bank s authority to invest in certain types of loans or other investments is limited by federal law 
on october   the ots and other federal bank regulatory authorities published the interagency guidance on nontraditional mortgage product risks  or the guidance 
the guidance describes sound practices for managing risk  as well as marketing  originating and servicing nontraditional mortgage products  which include  among other things  interest only loans 
the guidance sets forth supervisory expectations with respect to loan terms and underwriting standards  portfolio and risk management practices and consumer protection 
for example  the guidance indicates that originating interest only loans with reduced documentation is considered a layering of risk and that institutions are expected to demonstrate mitigating factors to support their underwriting decision and the borrower s repayment capacity 
specifically  the guidance indicates that a lender may accept a borrower s statement as to the borrower s income without obtaining verification only if there are mitigating factors that clearly minimize the need for direct verification of repayment capacity and that  for many borrowers  institutions should be able to readily document income 
on december   the ots published guidance entitled concentrations in commercial real estate lending  sound risk management practices  or the cre guidance  to address concentrations of commercial real estate loans in savings associations 
the cre guidance reinforces and enhances the ots s existing regulations and guidelines for real estate lending and loan portfolio management  but does not establish specific commercial real estate lending limits 
the bank is evaluating the cre guidance as to its impact on the conduct of the bank s business 
the bank believes it will be able to effectively implement the requirements set forth in the cre guidance during fiscal year loans to one borrower limitations 
the bank is generally subject to the same limits on loans to one borrower as a national bank 
with specified exceptions  the bank s total loans or extension of credit to a single borrower or group of related borrowers may not exceed of the bank s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus  which does not include accumulated other comprehensive income 
the bank may lend additional amounts up to of its unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus if the loans or extensions of credit are fully secured by readily marketable collateral 
the bank currently complies with applicable loans to one borrower limitations 
at march   the bank s limit on loans to one borrower based on its unimpaired capital and surplus was million 
qtl test 
under hola  the bank must comply with a qualified thrift lender qtl test 
under this test  the bank is required to maintain at least of its portfolio assets in certain qualified thrift investments on a monthly basis in at least nine months of the most recent twelve month period 
portfolio assets means  in general  an association s total assets less the sum of a specified liquid assets up to of total assets  b goodwill and other intangible assets and c the value of property used to conduct the bank s business 
qualified thrift investments include various types of loans made for residential and housing purposes  investments related to such purposes  including certain mortgage backed and related securities and consumer loans 
if the bank fails the qtl test  it must either operate under certain restrictions on its activities or convert from a thrift charter to a bank charter 
in addition  if the bank does not requalify under the qtl test within three years after failing the test  the institution would be prohibited from engaging in any activity not permissible for a national bank and would have to repay any outstanding advances from the fhlb ny as promptly as possible 
at march   the bank maintained approximately of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments 
the bank had also met the qtl test in each of the prior months and was  therefore  a qualified thrift lender 

table of contents capital requirements 
ots regulations require the bank to meet three minimum capital ratios a tangible capital ratio requirement of of total assets  as adjusted under ots regulations  a leverage ratio requirement of of core capital to such adjusted total assets  and a risk based capital ratio requirement of of core and supplementary capital to total risk weighted assets 
in determining compliance with the risk based capital requirement  the bank must compute its risk weighted assets by multiplying its assets and certain off balance sheet items by risk weights  which range from for cash and obligations issued by the us government or its agencies to for consumer and commercial loans  as assigned by the ots capital regulations based on the risks that the ots believes are inherent in the type of asset 
generally  tangible capital is defined as common stockholders equity including retained earnings  certain non cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related earnings and minority interests in equity accounts of fully consolidated subsidiaries  less intangibles other than certain mortgage servicing rights and investments in and loans to subsidiaries engaged in activities not permissible for a national bank 
core capital is defined similarly to tangible capital  but also includes certain qualifying supervisory goodwill less certain disallowed assets 
supplementary capital includes cumulative and other perpetual preferred stock  mandatory convertible securities  subordinated debt and intermediate preferred stock and the allowance for loan and lease losses 
in addition  up to of unrealized gains on available for sale equity securities with a readily determinable fair value may be included in supplementary capital 
the allowance for loan and lease losses includable in supplementary capital is limited to a maximum of of risk weighted assets  and the amount of supplementary capital that may be included as total capital cannot exceed the amount of core capital 
in assessing an institution s capital adequacy  the ots takes into consideration not only these numeric factors but qualitative factors as well  and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where necessary 
the bank  as a matter of prudent management  targets as its goal the maintenance of capital ratios which exceed these minimum requirements and are consistent with the bank s risk profile 
at march   the bank exceeded each of its capital requirements with a tangible capital ratio of  leverage capital ratio of and total risk based capital ratio of the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia  as amended  requires that the ots and other federal banking agencies revise their risk based capital standards  with appropriate transition rules  to ensure that they take into account interest rate risk  concentrations of risk and the risks of non traditional activities 
the ots adopted regulations  effective january   that set forth the methodology for calculating an interest rate risk component to be incorporated into the ots risk based capital regulations 
on may   the ots adopted an amendment to its capital regulations which eliminated the interest rate risk component of the risk based capital requirement 
pursuant to the amendment  the ots will continue to monitor the interest rate risk of individual institutions through the ots requirements for interest rate risk management  the ability of the ots to impose individual minimum capital requirements on institutions that exhibit a high degree of interest rate risk  and the requirements of thrift bulletin a  which provides guidance on the management of interest rate risk and the responsibility of boards of directors in that area 
in addition  the ots monitors the interest rate risk of individual institutions through a variety of means  including an analysis of the change in portfolio value  or npv 
npv is defined as the net present value of the expected future cash flows of an entity s assets and liabilities and therefore  hypothetically represents the value of an institution s net worth 
the ots has also used this npv analysis as part of its evaluation of certain applications or notices submitted by thrift institutions 
in addition  ots bulletin a provides guidance on the management of interest rate risk and the responsibility of boards of directors in that area 
the ots  through its general oversight of the safety and soundness of savings associations  retains the right to impose minimum capital requirements on individual institution to the extent the institution is not in compliance with certain written guidelines established by the ots regarding npv analysis 
the ots has not imposed any such requirements on the bank 
prompt corrective action regulations 
under the prompt corrective action regulations  the ots is authorized and  in some cases  required to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized savings banks 
for this purpose  a savings bank would be placed in one of the following five categories based on the bank s regulatory capital well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  or critically undercapitalized 

table of contents the severity of the action authorized or required to be taken under the prompt corrective action regulations increases as a bank s capital decreases within the three undercapitalized categories 
all banks are prohibited from paying dividends or other capital distributions or paying management fees to any controlling person if  following such distribution  the bank would be undercapitalized 
generally  a capital restoration plan must be filed with the ots within days of the date a bank receives notice that it is undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized 
in addition  various mandatory supervisory actions become immediately applicable to the institution  including restrictions on growth of assets and other forms of expansion 
under the ots regulations  generally  a federally chartered savings bank is treated as well capitalized if its total risk based capital ratio is or greater  its tier risk based capital ratio is or greater  and its leverage ratio is or greater  and it is not subject to any order or directive by the ots to meet a specific capital level 
when appropriate  the ots can require corrective action by a savings association holding company under the prompt corrective action provisions of federal law 
at march   the bank was considered well capitalized by the ots 
limitation on capital distributions 
the ots imposes various restrictions on the bank s ability to make capital distributions  including cash dividends  payments to repurchase or otherwise acquire its shares and other distributions charged against capital 
a savings institution that is the subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company  such as the bank  must file a notice with the ots at least days before making a capital distribution 
however  the bank must file an application for prior approval if the total amount of its capital distributions including each proposed distribution  for the applicable calendar year would exceed the bank s net income for that year plus the bank s retained net income for the previous two years 
the bank may not pay dividends to the holding company if  after paying those dividends  the bank would fail to meet the required minimum levels under risk based capital guidelines and the minimum leverage and tangible capital ratio requirements or the ots notified the bank that it was in need of more than normal supervision 
the bank is prohibited from making capital distributions if the bank would be undercapitalized following the distribution  the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns  or the capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any statute  regulation or agreement 
liquidity 
the bank maintains liquidity levels to meet operational needs 
in the normal course of business  the levels of liquid assets during any given period are dependent on operating  investing and financing activities 
cash and due from banks  federal funds sold and repurchase agreements with maturities of three months or less are the bank s most liquid assets 
the bank maintains a liquidity policy to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure its safe and sound operations 
branching 
subject to certain limitations  federal law permits the bank to establish branches in any state of the united states 
the authority for the bank to establish an interstate branch network would facilitate a geographic diversification of the bank s activities 
this authority under federal law and ots regulations preempts any state law purporting to regulate branching by federal savings associations 
community reinvestment 
under the cra  as amended  as implemented by ots regulations  the bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for the bank nor does it limit the bank s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community 
the cra does  however  require the ots  in connection with its examination of the bank  to assess the bank s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by the bank 
in particular  the system focuses on three tests a lending test  to evaluate the institution s record of making loans in its assessment areas  an investment test  to evaluate the institution s record of investing in community development projects  affordable housing and programs benefiting low or moderate income individuals and businesses  and a service test  to evaluate the institution s delivery of banking services through its branches  atm centers and other offices 

table of contents the cra also requires all institutions to make public disclosure of their cra ratings 
the bank received an outstanding cra rating in its most recent examination conducted in regulations require that we publicly disclose certain agreements that are in fulfillment of cra 
the holding company has no such agreements in place at this time 
transactions with related parties 
the bank s authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates and insiders is limited by ots regulations and by sections a  b  g and h of the federal reserve act fra 
in general  these transactions must be on terms which are as favorable to the bank as comparable transactions with non affiliates 
additionally  certain types of these transactions are restricted to an aggregate percentage of the bank s capital 
collateral in specified amounts must usually be provided by affiliates in order to receive loans from the bank 
in addition  ots regulations prohibit a savings bank from lending to any of its affiliates that is engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and from purchasing the securities of any affiliate other than a subsidiary 
the bank s authority to extend credit to its directors  executive officers  and shareholders  as well as to entities controlled by such persons  is currently governed by the requirements of sections g and h of the fra and regulation o of the frb 
among other things  these provisions require that extensions of credit to insiders a be made on terms that are substantially the same as  and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than  those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features and b not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons  individually and in the aggregate  which limits are based  in part  on the amount of the bank s capital 
in addition  extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by the bank s board 
at march   there were no loans to officers or directors 
the frb has confirmed its previous interpretations of sections a and b of the fra with regulation w 
the ots has also conformed its regulations to agree with regulation w 
regulation w made various changes to existing law regarding sections a and b  including expanding the definition of what constitutes an affiliate subject to sections a and b and exempting certain subsidiaries of state chartered banks from the restrictions of sections a and b 
the ots regulations provide for additional restrictions imposed on savings associations under section of hola  including provisions prohibiting a savings association from making a loan to an affiliate that is engaged in non bank holding company activities and provisions prohibiting a savings association from purchasing or investing in securities issued by an affiliate that is not a subsidiary 
the ots regulations also include certain specific exemptions from these prohibitions 
the frb and the ots expect each depository institution that is subject to sections a and b to implement policies and procedures to ensure compliance with regulation w and the ots regulation 
these regulations have had no material adverse effect on our business 
section of the sarbanes oxley act prohibits the extension of personal loans to directors and executive officers of issuers as defined in the sarbanes oxley act 
the prohibition  however  does not apply to mortgages advanced by an insured depository institution  such as the bank  that is subject to the insider lending restrictions of section h of the fra 
assessment 
the ots charges assessments to recover the cost of examining savings associations and their affiliates 
these assessments are based on three components the size of the association  on which the basic assessment is based  the association s supervisory condition  which results in an additional assessment based on a percentage of the basic assessment for any savings institution with a composite rating of   or in its most recent safety and soundness examination  and the complexity of the association s operations  which results in an additional assessment based on a percentage of the basic assessment for any savings association that managed over billion in trust assets  serviced for others loans aggregating more than billion  or had certain off balance sheet assets aggregating more than billion 
effective july   the ots adopted a final rule replacing examination fees for savings and loan holding companies with semi annual assessments 
for fiscal  carver paid  in ots assessments 
enforcement 
the ots has primary enforcement responsibility over the bank 
this enforcement authority includes  among other things  the ability to assess civil money penalties  to issue cease and desist orders and to remove directors and officers 
in general  these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices 
standards for safety and soundness 
the ots has adopted guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards 
the guidelines establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems  internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth  asset quality  earnings  compensation  fees and benefits 
in general  the guidelines require  among other things  appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines 
in addition  ots regulations authorize  but do not require  the ots to order an institution that has been given notice that it is not satisfying these safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan 
if  after being so notified  an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an accepted compliance plan  the ots must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized association is subject under the prompt corrective action provisions of federal law 
if an institution fails to comply with such an order  the ots may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties 

table of contents insurance of deposit accounts the deposits of the bank are insured up to applicable limits by the dif 
the dif is the successor to the bank insurance fund and the savings association insurance fund  which were merged in the fdic recently amended its risk based assessment system for to implement authority granted by the federal deposit insurance reform act of the reform act 
under the revised system  insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations  regulatory capital levels and certain other factors 
an institution s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned 
risk category i  which contains the least risky depository institutions  is expected to include more than of all institutions 
unlike the other categories  risk category i contains further risk differentiation based on the fdic s analysis of financial ratios  examination component ratings and other information 
assessment rates are determined semi annually by the fdic and currently range from five to seven basis points for the healthiest institutions risk category i to basis points of assessable deposits for the riskiest risk category iv 
the fdic may adjust rates uniformly from one quarter to the next  except that no single adjustment can exceed three basis points 
the reform act also provided for a one time credit for eligible institutions based on their assessment base as of december  subject to certain limitations with respect to institutions that are exhibiting weaknesses  credits can be used to offset assessments until exhausted 
the bank s one time credits are expected to fully cover the assessment 
the reform act also provided for the possibility that the fdic may pay dividends to insured institutions once the dif reserve ratio equals or exceeds of estimated insured deposits 
in addition to the assessment for deposit insurance  institutions are required to make payments on bonds issued in the late s by the financing corporation to recapitalize a predecessor deposit insurance fund 
this payment is established quarterly  and during the calendar year ending december   averaged basis points of assessable deposits 
the reform act provided the fdic with authority to adjust the dif ratio to insured deposits within a range of to  in contrast to the prior statutorily fixed ratio of 
the ratio  which is viewed by the fdic as the level that the fund should achieve  was established by the agency at for the fdic has authority to increase insurance assessments 
a significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the community bank and the commercial bank 
management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future 
insurance of deposits may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law  regulation  rule  order or condition imposed by the fdic 
the management of the bank does not know of any practice  condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance 
the bank s total expense in fiscal for fdic assessment for financing corporation fico bonds interest payments was  due to the bank s favorable assessment risk classification there was no deposit insurance assessment on our deposits for fiscal federal home loan bank system 
the bank is a member of the fhlb ny  which is one of the twelve regional banks composing the fhlb system 
each regional bank provides a central credit facility primarily for its member institutions 
the bank  as an fhlb ny member  is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the fhlb ny in an amount equal to the greater of i of the aggregate principal amount of its unpaid residential mortgage loans  home purchase contracts and similar obligations at the beginning of each year  and ii or such greater fraction as established by the fhlb ny of its outstanding advances from the fhlb ny 
the bank was in compliance with this requirement with an investment in the capital stock of the fhlb ny at march  of million 
any advances from an fhlb ny must be secured by specified types of collateral  and all long term advances may be obtained only for the purpose of providing funds for residential housing finance 
fhlb ny is required to provide funds for the resolution of insolvent thrifts and to contribute funds for affordable housing programs 
these requirements could reduce the amount of earnings that the fhlb ny can pay as dividends to their members and could also result in the fhlb ny imposing a higher rate of interest on advances to their members 
if dividends were reduced  or interest on future fhlb ny advances increased  the bank s net interest income would be adversely affected 
dividends from fhlb ny to the bank amounted to   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the fhlb ny suspended dividend payments to stockholders due to losses in its securities portfolio  but resumed payment in the fourth quarter 
the dividend rate paid on fhlb ny stock at march  was 

table of contents under the gramm leach bliley act  as amended gramm leach  which repeals historical restrictions and eliminates many federal and state law barriers to affiliations among banks and securities firms  insurance companies and other financial service providers  membership in the fhlb system is now voluntary for all federally chartered savings banks such as the bank 
gramm leach also replaces the existing redeemable stock structure of the fhlb system with a capital structure that requires each fhlb to meet a leverage limit and a risk based permanent capital requirement 
two classes of stock are authorized class a redeemable on six months notice and class b redeemable on five years notice 
pursuant to regulations promulgated by the federal housing finance board  as required by gramm leach  the fhlb has adopted a capital plan that will change the foregoing minimum stock ownership requirements for fhlb stock 
under the new capital plan  each member of the fhlb will have to maintain a minimum investment in fhlb capital stock in an amount equal to the sum of the greater of  or of the member s mortgage related assets and of the dollar amount of any outstanding advances under such member s advances  collateral pledge and security agreement with the fhlb ny 
federal reserve system 
under the frb s regulations  the bank is required to maintain non interest earning reserves against its transaction accounts 
frb regulations generally require that a reserves of must be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts between million and million subject to adjustment by the frb  and b a reserve of million and subject to adjustment by the frb between and must be maintained against that portion of total transaction accounts in excess of million 
the first million of otherwise reservable balances are exempted from the reserve requirements 
the bank is in compliance with these reserve requirements 
because required reserves must be maintained in the form of either vault cash  a non interest bearing account at a federal reserve bank  or a pass through account as defined by the frb  the effect of this reserve requirement is to reduce the bank s interest earning assets to the extent that the requirement exceeds vault cash 
privacy protection 
carver federal is subject to ots regulations implementing the privacy protection provisions of gramm leach 
these regulations require the bank to disclose its privacy policy  including identifying with whom it shares nonpublic personal information  to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter 
the regulations also require the bank to provide its customers with initial and annual notices that accurately reflect its privacy policies and practices 
in addition  to the extent its sharing of such information is not exempted  the bank is required to provide its customers with the ability to opt out of having the bank share their nonpublic personal information with unaffiliated third parties before they can disclose such information  subject to certain exceptions 
the bank is subject to regulatory guidelines establishing standards for safeguarding customer information 
these regulations implement certain provisions of gramm leach 
the guidelines describe the agencies expectations for the creation  implementation and maintenance of an information security program  which would include administrative  technical and physical safeguards appropriate to the size and complexity of the institution and the nature and scope of its activities 
the standards set forth in the guidelines are intended to insure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information  protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer 
the bank has a policy to comply with the foregoing guidelines 
holding company regulation 
the holding company is a savings and loan holding company regulated by the ots 
as such  the holding company is registered with and is subject to ots examination and supervision  as well as certain reporting requirements 
in addition  the ots has enforcement authority over the holding company and its subsidiaries 
among other things  this authority permits the ots to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the financial safety  soundness or stability of a subsidiary savings institution 
unlike bank holding companies  federal savings and loan holding companies are not subject to any regulatory capital requirements or to supervision by the frb 
gramm leach restricts the powers of new unitary savings and loan holding companies 
unitary savings and loan holding companies that are grandfathered  ie  unitary savings and loan holding companies in existence or with applications filed with the ots on or before may   such as carver  retain their authority under the prior law 
all other unitary savings and loan holding companies are limited to financially related activities permissible for bank holding companies  as defined under gramm leach 
gramm leach also prohibits non financial companies from acquiring grandfathered unitary savings and loan holding companies 

table of contents restrictions applicable to all savings and loan holding companies 
federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company  including the holding company  directly or indirectly  from acquiring control as defined under hola of another savings institution or a holding company parent without prior ots approval  through merger  consolidation  or purchase of assets  another savings institution or a holding company thereof  or acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of such institution or a holding company  without prior ots approval  or control of any depository institution not insured by the fdic except through a merger with and into the holding company s savings institution subsidiary that is approved by the ots 
a savings and loan holding company may not acquire as a separate subsidiary an insured institution that has a principal office outside of the state where the principal office of its subsidiary institution is located  except in the case of certain emergency acquisitions approved by the fdic  if such holding company controls a savings institution subsidiary that operated a home or branch office in such additional state as of march   or if the laws of the state in which the savings institution to be acquired is located specifically authorize a savings institution chartered by that state to be acquired by a savings institution chartered by the state where the acquiring savings institution or savings and loan holding company is located or by a holding company that controls such a state chartered association 
the hola prohibits a savings and loan holding company directly or indirectly  or through one or more subsidiaries from acquiring another savings association or holding company thereof without prior written approval of the ots  acquiring or retaining  with certain exceptions  more than of a non subsidiary savings association  a non subsidiary holding company  or a non subsidiary company engaged in activities other than those permitted by the hola  or acquiring or retaining control of a depository institution that is not federally insured 
in evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings associations  the ots must consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and institution involved  the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the insurance funds  the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors

new york state banking laws and regulations 
on october   carver federal established a new subsidiary  cmb  as a state chartered limited purpose commercial bank in new york  to accept deposits of municipalities and other governmental entities in the state of new york 
cmb is subject to extensive regulation  examination and supervision by the new york state superintendent of banks  as its primary regulator and the fdic  as the deposit insurer 
in addition to being a regulator of cmb  the new york state banking department has adopted section l to the banking law and regulations which impose restrictions and limitations on certain high cost home loans made by any individual or entity  including a federally chartered savings bank  that originates more than one high cost home loan in new york state in a month period 
among other things  the regulations and statute prohibit certain mortgage loan provisions and certain acts and practices by originators and impose certain disclosure and reporting requirements 
it is unclear whether these provisions would be preempted by section a of hola  as implemented by the lending and investment regulations of the ots 
the ots has not yet adopted regulations regarding high cost mortgage loans and is currently considering whether it will do so 
although the bank does not originate loans that meet the definition of high cost mortgage loan under the proposed regulations  in the event the bank determines to originate such loans in the future  the bank may be subject to such regulation  if adopted as proposed 
other federal regulation 
the bank is subject to ots regulations implementing the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of  or the usa patriot act 
the usa patriot act gives the federal government new powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures  expanded surveillance powers  increased information sharing  and broadened anti money laundering requirements 
by way of amendments to the bank secrecy act  title iii of the usa patriot act takes measures intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies

establishment of enhanced due diligence policies  procedures and controls designed to detect and report money laundering 
prohibition on correspondent accounts for foreign shell banks and compliance with recordkeeping obligations with respect to correspondent accounts of foreign banks 
federal and state taxation federal taxation general 
the holding company and the bank currently file consolidated federal income tax returns  report their income for tax return purposes on the basis of a taxable year ending march st  using the accrual method of accounting and are subject to federal income taxation in the same manner as other corporations with some exceptions  including in particular the bank s tax reserve for bad debts discussed below 
the following discussion of tax matters is intended only as a summary and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the bank or the holding company 
bad debt reserves 
prior to fiscal the bank met the requirement as a small bank one with assets having an adjusted tax basis of million or less and was permitted to maintain a reserve for bad debts with respect to qualifying loans  which  in general  are loans secured by certain interests in real property  and to make  within specified formula limits  annual additions to the reserve which are deductible for purposes of computing the bank s taxable income 
since fiscal year  the bank has not been considered to be a small bank because its total assets have exceeded million 
distributions 
to the extent that the bank makes non dividend distributions to shareholders  such distributions will be considered to result in distributions from the bank s base year reserve  ie  its reserve as of march   to the extent thereof and then from its supplemental reserve for losses on loans  and an amount based on the amount distributed will be included in the bank s taxable income 
non dividend distributions include distributions in excess of the bank s current and accumulated earnings and profits  distributions in redemption of stock and distributions in partial or complete liquidation 
however  dividends paid out of the bank s current or accumulated earnings and profits  as calculated for federal income tax purposes  will not constitute non dividend distributions and  therefore  will not be included in the bank s taxable income 
the amount of additional taxable income created from a non dividend distribution is an amount that  when reduced by the tax attributable to the income  is equal to the amount of the distribution 
thus  approximately one and one half times the non dividend distribution would be includable in gross income for federal income tax purposes  assuming a federal corporate income tax rate 
elimination of dividends  dividends received deduction 
the holding company may exclude from its income of dividends received from the bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations 
the corporate dividends received deduction is generally in the case of dividends received from unaffiliated corporations with which the holding company and the bank will not file a consolidated tax return  except that if the holding company or the bank owns more than of the stock of a corporation distributing a dividend  then of any dividends received may be deducted 
state and local taxation state of new york 
the bank and the holding company are subject to new york state franchise tax on their entire net income or one of several alternative bases  whichever results in the highest tax 
entire net income means federal taxable income with adjustments 
the bank and the holding company file combined returns and are subject to taxation in the same manner as other corporations with some exceptions  including the bank s deductions for additions to its reserve for bad debts 
the new york state franchise tax rate based upon entire net income for both fiscal years and was  including the metropolitan commuter transportation district surcharge of net income 
in general  the holding company is not required to pay new york state tax on dividends and interest received from the bank or on gains realized on the sale of bank stock 
of dividend income  and gains and losses from subsidiary capital are excluded from new york state entire net income 
distributions to carver federal received from carver asset corporation are eligible for the new york state dividends received deduction 
however  the holding company has been subject to a franchise tax rate of including the metropolitan commuter transportation district surcharge for both fiscal years and based upon alternative entire net income 
for this purpose  alternative entire net income is determined by adding back of dividend income  and gains and losses from subsidiary capital to new york state entire net income 

table of contents new york state has enacted legislation that enabled the bank to avoid the recapture of the new york state tax bad debt reserves that otherwise would have occurred as a result of the changes in federal law and to continue to utilize either the federal method or a method based on a percentage of its taxable income for computing additions to its bad debt reserve 
new york city 
the bank and the holding company are also subject to a similarly calculated new york city banking corporation tax of on income allocated to new york city 
in this connection  legislation was enacted regarding the use and treatment of tax bad debt reserves that is substantially similar to the new york state legislation described above 
the bank and the holding company are subject to new york city banking corporation tax of on alternative entire net income allocated to new york city 
delaware taxation 
as a delaware holding company not earning income in delaware  the holding company is exempted from delaware corporate income tax but is required to file an annual report with and pay an annual franchise tax to the state of delaware

table of contents item a 
risk factors 
risk is an inherent part of carver s business and activities 
the following is a summary of risk factors relevant to the company s operations which should be carefully reviewed 
these risk factors do not necessarily appear in the order of importance 
changes in interest rate environment may negatively affect carver s net income  mortgage loan originations and valuation of available for sale securities 
the company s earnings depend largely on the relationship between the yield on interest earning assets  primarily our mortgage  construction and business loans and mortgage backed securities  and the cost of deposits and borrowings 
this relationship  known as the interest rate spread  is subject to fluctuation and is affected by economic and competitive factors which influence market interest rates  the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the level of non performing assets 
fluctuations in market interest rates affect customer demand for products and services 
carver is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest bearing liabilities reprice or mature more slowly or more rapidly or on a different basis than its interest earning assets 
in addition  the actual amount of time before mortgage  construction and business loans and mortgage backed securities are repaid can be significantly impacted by changes in mortgage prepayment rates and prevailing market interest rates 
mortgage prepayment rates will vary due to a number of factors  including the regional economy in the area where the underlying mortgages were originated  seasonal factors  demographic variables and the ability to assume the underlying mortgages 
however  the major factors affecting prepayment rates are prevailing interest rates  related loan refinancing opportunities and competition 
the company s objective is to fund its liquidity needs primarily through lower costing deposit growth 
however  from time to time carver federal borrows from the fhlb ny 
more recently  the cost of deposits and borrowings have become significantly higher with the rising interest rate environment  which has negatively impacted net interest income 
during fiscal  the federal open market committee fomc raised the federal funds rate two times a total of basis points 
us treasury yields on the thirteen week maturities have increased in fiscal from fiscal while the five and ten year maturities have decreased 
this has resulted in further flattening and at times inversion of the us treasury yield curve 
the bank s short term borrowings  as well as its deposits  are generally priced relative to short term us treasury yields  whereas its mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities are generally priced relative to medium term two to five years us treasury yields 
the flattening or inversion of the yield curve reduces the spread between the yield on our interest earning assets and the cost of deposits and borrowings  thereby reducing net income 
interest rates are expected to continue to fluctuate and the company cannot predict future frb actions or other factors that will cause rates to change 
the estimated fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio may increase or decrease depending on changes in interest rates 
carver federal s securities portfolio is comprised primarily of adjustable rate securities 
since interest rates have not risen as fast as in fiscal  there has been an improvement in the valuation of the bank s available for sale securities 
carver s results of operations are affected by economic conditions in the new york metropolitan area 
at march   a significant portion of the bank s lending portfolio was concentrated in the new york metropolitan area 
as a result of this geographic concentration  carver s results of operations are largely dependent on economic conditions in this area 
decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for loans to its borrowers 
adverse changes in the economy caused by inflation  recession  unemployment or other factors beyond our control may also have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make timely mortgage or business loan payments  which would have an adverse impact on our earnings 
consequently  deterioration in economic conditions in the new york metropolitan area could have a material adverse impact on the quality of the bank s loan portfolio  which could result in increased delinquencies  decreased interest income results as well as an adverse impact on loan loss experience with probable increased allowance for loan losses 
such deterioration also could adversely impact the demand for products and services  and  accordingly  further negatively affect results of operations 
during fiscal  the national real estate market in general was somewhat weaker than a year ago but continued to support new and existing home sales at albeit reduced levels 
the slowdown in the general housing market is evidenced by reports of reduced levels of new and existing home sales  increasing inventories of houses on the market  stagnant to declining property values and an increase in the length of time houses remain on the market 
however  carver federal s direct local real estate markets exhibit continuing signs of strength  which appears to be due in part to the limited availability of affordable housing alternatives in the markets in which carver federal operates 
no assurance can be given that these conditions will improve or will not worsen or that such conditions will not result in a decrease in our interest income or an adverse impact on our loan losses 

table of contents strong competition within the bank s market areas could hurt expected profits and slow growth 
the new york metropolitan area has a high density of financial institutions  a number of which are significantly larger than carver federal and with greater financial resources 
additionally  various large out of state financial institutions continue to enter the new york metropolitan area market 
all are considered competitors to varying degrees 
carver federal faces intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits 
competition for loans  both locally and in the aggregate  comes principally from mortgage banking companies  commercial banks  savings banks and savings and loan associations 
most direct competition for deposits comes from commercial banks  savings banks  savings and loan associations and credit unions 
the bank also faces competition for deposits from money market mutual funds and other corporate and government securities funds as well as from other financial intermediaries such as brokerage firms and insurance companies 
market area competition is a factor in pricing the bank s loans and deposits  which could reduce net interest income 
competition also makes it more challenging to effectively grow loan and deposit balances 
the company s profitability depends upon its continued ability to successfully compete in its market areas 
the bank s increased emphasis on non residential and construction real estate lending may create increased exposure to lending risks 
at march   million  or  of our total loans receivable portfolio consisted of non residential and construction real estate loans compared to million  or  at march  non residential and construction real estate loans generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than one to four family loans because they typically have larger balances and are more sensitive to changes in the economy 
payments on these loans often depend upon the successful operation and management of the underlying properties and the businesses which operate from within them  repayment of such loans may be affected by factors outside the borrower s control  such as adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy or changes in government regulation 
the bank has increased the business loan portfolio during fiscal with the acquisition of ccb 
at march   million  or  of our total loans receivable consisted of business loans as compared to  or  at march  business loans generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than one to four family loans because they typically have larger balances and are more sensitive to changes in the economy 
payments on these loans often depend upon the successful operation and management of the underlying business segment and the businesses which operate from within them  repayment of such loans may be affected by factors outside the borrower s control  such as adverse economic conditions  increased competition or changes in government regulation 
the bank may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition  and acquisitions may result in unforeseen integration difficulties 
the company periodically explores acquisition opportunities through which it seeks to expand market share 
recently  the company acquired ccb to expand its product line by entering the small business market 
the success of the acquisition will depend on  among other things  carver federal s ability to realize anticipated cost savings and to combine the businesses of carver federal and ccb in a manner that does not materially disrupt the existing customer relationships of carver federal or ccb or result in decreased revenues from any loss of customers 
if carver federal is not able to successfully achieve these objectives  the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected 
in addition  difficulty in integrating this and any other acquired business may result in the company not being able to realize expected revenue increases and cost savings  and may cause disruption of its business  and may otherwise adversely affect its ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
currently  the company is on schedule with its ccb integration efforts  and expects to complete integration by the end of the second quarter of fiscal it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees  the disruption of carver federal s or ccb s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards  controls  procedures and policies that adversely affect the ability of carver federal to maintain relationships with customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger 
the bank operates in a highly regulated industry  which limits the manner and scope of our business activities 
carver federal is subject to extensive supervision  regulation and examination by the ots  by the fdic  and  to a lesser extent  by the new york state banking department 
as a result  we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business  undertake new investments and activities and obtain financing 
this regulatory structure is designed primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance funds and our depositors  and not to benefit our stockholders 
this regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies  including policies with respect to capital levels  the timing and amount of dividend payments  the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes 
in addition  we must comply with significant anti money laundering and anti terrorism laws 
government agencies have substantial discretion to impose significant monetary penalties on institutions which fail to comply with these laws 

table of contents on october   the ots and other federal bank regulatory authorities published the interagency guidance on nontraditional mortgage product risks  or the guidance 
in general  the guidance applies to all residential mortgage loan products that allow borrowers to defer repayment of principal or interest 
the guidance describes sound practices for managing risk  as well as marketing  originating and servicing nontraditional mortgage products  which include  among other things  interest only loans 
the guidance sets forth supervisory expectations with respect to loan terms and underwriting standards  portfolio and risk management practices and consumer protection 
for example  the guidance indicates that originating interest only loans with reduced documentation is considered a layering of risk and that institutions are expected to demonstrate mitigating factors to support their underwriting decision and the borrower s repayment capacity 
specifically  the guidance indicates that a lender may accept a borrower s statement as to the borrower s income without obtaining verification only if there are mitigating factors that clearly minimize the need for direct verification of repayment capacity and that  for many borrowers  institutions should be able to readily document income 
from time to time  we may originate interest only and interest only reduced documentation residential loans 
we originate such loans for sale to investors  such as the federal national mortgage association  known as fannie mae 
we do not originate negative amortization or payment option loans 
reduced documentation loans include stated income  full asset  or sifa loans  stated income  stated asset  or sisa loans  and super streamline loans 
sifa and sisa loans require a prospective borrower to complete a standard mortgage loan application while the super streamline product requires the completion of an abbreviated application and is in effect considered a no documentation loan 
each of these products requires the receipt of an appraisal of the real estate used as collateral for the mortgage loan and a credit report on the prospective borrower 
the loans are priced according to our internal risk assessment of the loan giving consideration to the loan to value ratio  the potential borrower s credit scores and various other credit criteria 
sifa loans require the verification of a potential borrower s asset information on the loan application  but not the income information provided 
we are currently evaluating the guidance to determine our compliance and whether or not we need to modify our risk management practices and underwriting guidelines as they relate to originations and purchases of the subject loans  or practices relating to communications with consumers 
therefore  at this time  we cannot predict the impact the guidance may have  if any  on our loan origination and purchase volumes or our underwriting procedures in future periods 
efforts to comply with the sarbanes oxley act will involve significant expenditures  and non compliance with the sarbanes oxley act may adversely affect us 
the sarbanes oxley act of  and the related rules and regulations promulgated by the sec increase the scope  complexity and cost of corporate governance  reporting  and disclosure practice 
the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  greater compliance costs  including design  testing and audit costs related to internal controls  as a result of the sarbanes oxley act 
for example  under section of sarbanes oxley  beginning with carver s fiscal year ending march   the company s management will be required to issue a report on the company s internal controls over financial reporting  and beginning with carver s fiscal year ending march   carver s management will be required to file an auditors attestation report on the company s internal controls over financial reporting 
the company expects the implementation of these new rules and regulations to continue to increase its accounting  legal  and other costs  and to make some activities more difficult  time consuming  and costly 
in the event that the company is unable to maintain or achieve compliance with the sarbanes oxley act and related rules  carver s profitability and the market price of carver s stock may be adversely affected 
in addition  the rules adopted as a result of the sarbanes oxley act could make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance  including directors and officers liability insurance  which could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers 
changes in laws  government regulation and monetary policy may have a material effect on our results of operations 
financial institution regulation has been the subject of significant legislation and may be the subject of further significant legislation in the future  none of which is in the company s control 
significant new laws or changes in  or repeals of  existing laws  including with respect to federal and state taxation  may cause results of operations to differ materially 
in addition  cost of compliance could adversely affect carver s ability to operate profitably 
further  federal monetary policy significantly affects credit conditions for carver federal  particularly as implemented through the federal reserve system 
a material change in any of these conditions could have a material impact on carver federal  and therefore on the company s results of operations 
the bank s ability to pay dividends or lend funds to the company is subject to regulatory limitations which may prevent the company from making future dividend payments or principal and interest payments on its debt obligation 
carver is a unitary savings and loan association holding company regulated by the ots and almost all of its operating assets are owned by carver federal 
carver relies primarily on dividends from the bank to pay cash dividends to its stockholders  to engage in share repurchase programs and to pay principal and interest on its trust preferred debt obligation 
the ots regulates all capital distributions by the bank to the company  including dividend payments 
as the subsidiary of a savings and loan association holding company  carver federal must file a notice or an application depending on the proposed dividend amount with the ots prior to each capital distribution 
the ots will disallow any proposed dividend that would result in failure to meet the ots minimum capital requirements 
based on carver federal s current financial condition  it is not expected that this provision will have any impact on the company s receipt of dividends from the bank 
payment of dividends by carver federal also may be restricted at any time  at the discretion of the ots  if it deems the payment to constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice 

table of contents carver faces system failure risks and security risks 
the computer systems and network infrastructure the company and its third party service providers use could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems 
fire  power loss or other failures may effect carver s computer equipment and other technology  or that of the company s third party service providers 
also  the company s computer systems and network infrastructure could be damaged by hacking and identity theft which could adversely affect the results of our operations  or that of the company s third party service providers 
our business could suffer if we fail to retain skilled people 
the company s success depends on its ability to attract and retain key employees reflecting current market opportunities and challenges 
competition for the best people is intense  and the company s size and limited resources may present additional challenges in being able to retain the best possible employees which could adversely affect the results of our operations 
a natural disaster could harm carver s business 
natural disasters could harm the company s operations directly through interference with communications  as well as through the destruction of facilities and financial information systems 
such disasters may also have an impact on collateral underlying the bank s loans 
the company may face higher insurance costs in the event of such disasters

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 
the company s results of operations are significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates  government policies  changes in accounting standards and actions of regulatory agencies 
executive summary carver bancorp  inc is a savings and loan holding company organized under the laws of the state of delaware 
carver is committed to providing superior customer service while offering a range of banking products and financial services to our retail and commercial customers 
the holding company s primary subsidiary is carver federal savings bank  which operates from ten branches in the new york city boroughs of manhattan  brooklyn and queens 
merger with community capital bank in addition to increasing the number of branches  atm locations and other steps to grow organically  carver actively pursues acquisition opportunities that are in markets consistent with its urban niche and that carver believes will increase the bank s long term shareholder value 
on september   the bank acquired ccb  a brooklyn based new york state chartered commercial bank with approximately million in assets and two branches in a cash transaction of million 
under the terms of the merger agreement  ccb s shareholders were paid per outstanding share including options which immediately vested with the consummation of the merger and the bank incurred an additional  in transaction costs related to this acquisition 
the combined entity is operating under carver federal s thrift charter and carver federal continues to be supervised by the ots 
the transaction  which was accounted for under the purchase accounting method  included the recognition of approximately  of identifiable intangible assets  or core deposit intangibles  and excess of purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets goodwill of million 
at march  goodwill increased to million due to additional purchase accounting adjustments for deferred taxes and prepaid expenses 
the goodwill and intangible assets from this transaction are not deductible for tax purposes 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  the bank accrued million in certain merger related expenses associated with the acquisition including severance  early vendor contract termination fees  and systems integration and conversion fees 
by providing carver with a commercial banking platform  the transaction with ccb better positions the bank to capitalize on a densely populated small business market and the growing affluence of its local market 
the commercial banking platform has the potential to boost earnings and fees from lending and deposit accounts because small business loans are typically higher yielding than the bank s traditional real estate mortgage loans and small business core deposit accounts typically generate higher fee income than retail accounts 
carver is on track in its ccb integration efforts 
carver expects to generate cost efficiencies from the ccb acquisition  of which some or all may be reinvested into initiatives to enhance the small business platform and the long term growth prospects for the company 
fiscal fiscal was a challenging and exciting year for the company 
the bank achieved significant growth in its asset base through the acquisition of ccb  an award winning small business lender 
the company also announced a strategic alliance with merrill lynch co  whereby merrill lynch will provide carver customers access to wealth management financial advice and products 
the changing demographics and growing affluence of the bank s local market areas drove the company s decision to align with a global player in investment products capable of providing its customers with financial advice and the broadest array of products 
the interest rate environment continued to be extremely challenging in fiscal the federal reserve raised short term interest rates during the fiscal year by basis points  and basis points during the fiscal the increase in short term rates was greater than that of long term rates  and the result was a yield curve that was flat and at times inverted 
the shape of the yield curve resulted in compression in net interest margins in the entire industry  which also affected the bank s net interest margin 
to combat the impact of net interest margin compression  the bank not only continued its asset liability management strategy of replacing securities as they run off with higher yielding mortgage loans and replacing higher costing borrowings with lower costing deposits  in addition  during september  the bank accelerated its asset liability management strategy and executed a series of transactions designed to hasten the repositioning and deleveraging of the bank s balance sheet 
the bank sold million in lower yielding investments and used the proceeds to repay certain higher cost deposits and borrowings 
in addition  the bank transferred approximately million of primarily one to four family interest only loans from held for investment to held for sale with the intention of liquidating the loans and using the proceeds to reduce borrowings further 
as a result of the transfer  the bank recognized a million pre tax charge during the quarter ending september  
table of contents in fiscal  the bank experienced growth over fiscal in its core business with increases in its total loan portfolio and deposits  primarily resulting from the acquisition of ccb 
despite a weakening real estate market in many parts of the united states  local real estate markets remained strong and continued to support carver s ability to increase its loan portfolio notwithstanding loan repayments that remained relatively high and consistent with fiscal levels 
growth in construction  commercial mortgage and business loans  primarily the result of the ccb acquisition  were partially offset by declines in one to four family and multifamily residential loans during fiscal declines in one to four family and multifamily residential loans are consistent with the bank s focus on relatively higher yielding loans that pass the bank s underwriting standards 
growth in checking  money market and certificates of deposits  primarily the result of the ccb acquisition  were partially offset by a modest decline in savings and club deposits during fiscal because of the bank s decision to repay some of its maturing higher cost deposits  total deposits would have decreased in but for the ccb acquisition 
securities and borrowings portfolios decreased during fiscal  which is consistent with the company s strategy to reduce the lower yielding securities and invest in higher yielding mortgages and loans 
in june  carver federal was selected by the us department of treasury to receive an allocation of million in new markets tax credits 
the nmtc award is used stimulate economic development in low to moderate income communities 
the nmtc award enables the bank to invest with community and development partners in economic development projects with attractive terms including  in some cases  below market interest rates  which may have the effect of attracting capital to underserved communities and facilitating the revitalization of the community  pursuant to the goals of the nmtc program 
the nmtc program provides a credit to carver federal against federal income taxes when the bank makes qualified investments 
the credits are allocated over seven years from the time of the qualified investment 
during the seven year period  assuming the bank meets compliance requirements  the bank will receive of the invested award amount over each of three years  and over each of four years 
the nmtc award allows the bank to invest with community and development partners in local economic development projects on terms that are attractive to the bank and its partners  as a substantial portion of the award benefit is captured by the community through the economic development activity and the favorable terms of the investment 
the bank s nmtc award began in december when the bank invested million  one half of its million award 
during fiscal  the bank recognized million in tax benefits related to the nmtc award 
asset quality remained solid in fiscal notwithstanding the bank s loan portfolio growth and diversification into small business lending 
the company believes that the bank s loan loss provision recorded in fiscal and the bank s allowance for loan losses are adequate 
expenses increased in fiscal  primarily as a result of the acquisition of ccb and the related operating and merger related expenses  and costs associated with the bank s balance sheet repositioning 
in addition  investments in growth initiatives such as recently opened branch and atm locations  new product offerings  and marketing efforts contributed to the bank s expense position 
when combined  these expenses resulted in a substantial increase in the bank s efficiency ratio 
some of the expenses  such as the merger related expenses and costs associated with the bank s balance sheet repositioning  are non recurring items and will not have an on going impact on the bank s expenses 
the bank expects to realize efficiencies from the ccb acquisition  some or all of which may be reinvested into the business to enhance the company s long term growth prospects  and  as the recently opened branches and atm locations become more seasoned  the bank expects greater revenue contributions  which should have the effect of mitigating the impact of expenses on the bank s efficiency ratio 
on march   the company filed an amendment no 
to its annual report on form k for the year ended march   to reflect the restatement of its consolidated statements of cash flows 
refer to item a for more details 
fiscal the outlook for fiscal reflects many of the economic and competitive factors that the bank and the banking industry faced in fiscal as a result  we expect the operating environment to remain challenging 
in this challenging climate  the bank will continue to focus on growth in its traditional businesses  namely the expansion of real estate loans and retail deposits 
in addition  the recent acquisition of ccb expands the bank s core business and the bank expects to accelerate its penetration into new commercial banking opportunities as noted above 
the bank expects its new business and marketing efforts to core customer groups including small business owners  landlords  and churches and other non profits to drive the bank s deposit gathering success 
new products introduced in fiscal  including a lock box service for landlords to collect rental payments  a checking overdraft line of credit in an effort to continue building our checking account deposit base and participation in the certificate of deposit account registry services program to more efficiently address the collateral needs of large balance depositors  are expected to gain momentum 
with the recent acquisition of ccb  carver federal is positioned to aggressively pursue business operating deposit accounts 

table of contents the bank believes the efforts of its enhanced stable of lending officers will benefit from the continued strength of the local economy 
loan originations and the purchase mortgage market  combined with the anticipated reduced level of loan prepayments  should result in continued strong loan portfolio growth in fiscal the bank introduced sub prime and jumbo mortgages  primarily for sale in the secondary market  in fiscal to address the needs of prospective borrowers with modest credit issues 
management believes that a responsible lending program coupled with consumer education efforts makes these products important components of the bank s product line  while providing fee income for the bank because most sub prime and jumbo mortgages are immediately sold following underwriting 
the bank will further emphasize promotion of these products in fiscal in an effort to further fuel fee income growth 
as discussed above  the bank will target small businesses to add attractive loan and deposit accounts  and continue its focus on originating and purchasing primarily commercial real estate and construction loans for portfolio 
carver federal expects to increase core deposits as well as loan balances  thereby increasing net interest margin and fee income 
if a continued flat or inverted us treasury yield curve persists  the bank may continue to utilize a portion of the cash flow generated by operations and loan repayments to reduce its securities and borrowing portfolios  thereby limiting asset growth 
furthermore  carver expects to remain competitive in contests for resources from the public sector to extend the bank s reach  notwithstanding a field of competitors that includes banks with substantially greater resources than carver 
carver believes its proven ability to deliver mainstream financial products and services in historically underserved markets well positions the bank to compete for such public sector award competitions 
critical accounting policies various elements of our accounting policies  by their nature  are inherently subject to estimation techniques  valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments 
our policy with respect to the methodologies used to determine the allowance for loan losses is our most critical accounting policy 
this policy is important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations  and it involves a higher degree of complexity and requires management to make difficult and subjective judgments  which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters 
the use of different judgments  assumptions and estimates could result in material differences in our results of operations or financial condition 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of our critical accounting policies including those related to allowance for loan losses  and an explanation of the methods and assumptions underlying their application 
asset liability management net interest income  the primary component of carver federal s net income  is determined by the difference or spread between the yield earned on interest earning assets and the rates paid on its interest bearing liabilities and the relative amounts of such assets and liabilities 
because carver federal s interest bearing liabilities consist primarily of shorter term deposit accounts  carver federal s interest rate spread can be adversely affected by changes in general interest rates if its interest earning assets are not sufficiently sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the bank has sought to reduce its exposure to changes in interest rates by more closely matching the effective maturities and repricing periods of its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities through a variety of strategies  including the origination and purchase of adjustable rate mortgage loans for its portfolio  investment in adjustable rate mortgage backed securities and shorter term investment securities and the sale of all long term fixed rate mortgage loans originated into the secondary market 
discussion of market risk interest rate sensitivity analysis as a financial institution  the bank s primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility 
fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of the bank s assets and liabilities  and the market value of all interest earning assets  other than those which are short term in maturity 
since virtually all of the company s interest bearing assets and liabilities are held by the bank  most of the company s interest rate risk exposure is retained by the bank

table of contents carver federal seeks to manage its interest rate risk by monitoring and controlling the variation in repricing intervals between its assets and liabilities 
to a lesser extent  carver federal also monitors its interest rate sensitivity by analyzing the estimated changes in market value of its assets and liabilities assuming various interest rate scenarios 
as discussed more fully below  there are a variety of factors that influence the repricing characteristics of any given asset or liability 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific period if it will mature or reprice within that period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific period of time and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities and is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
generally  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap could result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap could adversely affect net interest income 
conversely  during a period of rising interest rates a negative gap could adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap could result in an increase in net interest income 
as illustrated below  carver federal had a negative one year gap equal to of total rate sensitive assets at march  as a result  carver federal s net interest income could be negatively affected by rising interest rates and positively affected by falling interest rates 
the following table sets forth information regarding the projected maturities  prepayments and repricing of the major rate sensitive asset and liability categories of carver federal as of march  maturity repricing dates have been projected by applying estimated prepayment rates based on the current rate environment 
the information presented in the following table is derived in part from data incorporated in schedule cmr consolidated maturity and rate  which is part of the bank s quarterly reports filed with the ots 
the repricing and other assumptions are not necessarily representative of the bank s actual results

table of contents the table above assumes that fixed maturity deposits are not withdrawn prior to maturity and that transaction accounts will decay as disclosed in the table above 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the table above 
although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in the market interest rates 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgages  generally have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayments and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
additionally  credit risk may increase as many borrowers may experience an inability to service their debt in the event of a rise in interest rate 
virtually all of the adjustable rate loans in carver federal s portfolio contain conditions that restrict the periodic change in interest rate 
net portfolio value npv analysis 
as part of its efforts to maximize net interest income while managing risks associated with changing interest rates  management also uses the npv methodology 
npv is the present value of expected net cash flows from existing assets less the present value of expected cash flows from existing liabilities plus the present value of net expected cash inflows from existing financial derivatives and off balance sheet contracts 
under this methodology  interest rate risk exposure is assessed by reviewing the estimated changes in npv that would hypothetically occur if interest rates rapidly rise or fall along the yield curve 
projected values of npv at both higher and lower regulatory defined rate scenarios are compared to base case values no change in rates to determine the sensitivity to changing interest rates 
presented below  as of march   is an analysis of the bank s interest rate risk as measured by changes in npv for instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts of basis points in market interest rates 
such limits have been established with consideration of the impact of various rate changes and the bank s current capital position 
the bank considers its level of interest rate risk for fiscal  as measured by changes in npv  to be minimal 
the information set forth below relates solely to the bank  however  because virtually all of the company s interest rate risk exposure lies at the bank level  management believes the table below also similarly reflects an analysis of the company s interest rate risk dollars in thousands change in rate amount change change npv ratio change bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp march  risk measures bp rate shock pre shock npv ratio npv as of pv of assets post shock npv ratio sensitivity measure decline in npv ratio bp bp certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in npv require the making of certain assumptions  which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the npv table presented assumes that the composition of carver federal s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the npv table provides an indication of carver federal s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on carver federal s net interest income and may differ from actual results 

table of contents average balance  interest and average yields and rates the following table sets forth certain information relating to carver federal s average interest earning assets and average interest bearing liabilities and related yields for the year ended march the table also presents information for the years indicated with respect to the difference between the weighted average yield earned on interest earning assets and the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  or interest rate spread  which savings institutions have traditionally used as an indicator of profitability 
another indicator of an institution s profitability is its net interest margin  which is its net interest income divided by the average balance of interest earning assets 
net interest income is affected by the interest rate spread and by the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities

the one to four family mortgage loan portfolio  including loans held for sale  decreased by million  or  to million at march  compared to million at march  the decrease in one to four family loans is primarily due to repayments and loan sales of million and million  respectively  partially offset by loan originations of million 
the multifamily real estate loan portfolio decreased by million  or  to million at march  compared to million at march  as repayments of million exceeded originations of million 
the decrease in premiums of  is primarily the result of repayments of loans 
the increase in the discounts is primarily the result of the purchase accounting associated with the acquisition of ccb 
the bank continues to grow its balance sheet through focusing on the origination of loans in the markets it serves and will continue to augment these originations with loan purchases 
total securities at march  decreased million to million from million at march   reflecting a decline of million in available for sale securities and a million decrease in held to maturity securities 
the decrease in available for sale securities primarily reflects million of principal repayments and maturities  million from sales of securities partially offset by the acquisition of the ccb portfolio of million 
the million decrease in held to maturity securities reflects principal payments and maturities 
available for sale securities represented of the total securities portfolio at march  compared to at march  the current strategy is to reduce the investment portfolio through normal cash flows and reinvest the proceeds into higher yielding loans 
however  the bank may invest in securities from time to time to help diversify its asset portfolio and satisfy collateral requirements for certain deposits 
at march   total liabilities increased million  or  to million compared to million at march  deposits increased million  or  to million at march  from million at march  the increase in deposits was primarily attributable to the acquisition of the ccb deposit portfolio of million

the increase in the average balance of interest bearing deposits was primarily due to the acquisition of ccb 
the increase in the average rate paid on deposits was principally due to the rise in the interest rate environment throughout fiscal interest expense on advances and other borrowed money decreased by  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in interest expense on borrowed money for fiscal reflects a million decline in the average balance of borrowed money reflecting management s strategy of using deposit growth and cash flows from the repayment of mortgage backed securities to repay fhlb ny advances 
partially offsetting the decrease was a rise of basis points in the average cost of borrowed money  primarily the result of increases in the indexed rate of trust preferred debt securities which adjust quarterly and have increased in the current interest rate environment 
net interest income net interest income represents the difference between income on interest earning assets and expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income depends primarily upon the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the corresponding interest rates earned and paid 
our net interest income is significantly impacted by changes in interest rate and market yield curves 
see discussion of market risk interest rate sensitivity analysis for further discussion on the potential impact of changes in interest rates on our results of operations

non interest income non interest income is comprised of loan fees and service charges  fee income from banking services and charges  gains or losses from the sale of securities  loans and other assets and certain other miscellaneous non interest income 
non interest income increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the rise in non interest income was comprised of an increase of  in loan fees and service charges  primarily greater loan prepayment penalty income and late charge fees 
additional depository fees and charges of  were achieved primarily from higher atm usage  growth in debit card income and commissions earned on the sale of investments and life insurance 
further contributing to the rise in non interest income was additional gains on the sale of loans of  predominantly from the bulk sale of million of residential one to four family mortgage loans 
an increase of  in other income was also achieved primarily as a result of additional income earned on the bank s investment in a bank owned life insurance program 
further contributing to the increase in non interest income year over year was the company s recognition of a million impairment charge deemed other than temporary in the second quarter of fiscal  resulting from the decline in market price of  shares of ifsb stock that the company previously held 
partially offsetting that impairment charge in fiscal was the receipt of a net million community development financial institutions grant from the department of the treasury and a  gain from the sale of securities 
non interest expense non interest expense increased by  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in non interest expense was primarily attributable to increases in net occupancy and equipment expenses of  and  respectively  resulting from the full year effect in fiscal of the new branch office and atm center openings in fiscal also contributing to the rise in non interest expense were increases in retail banking chargeoffs  legal fees and insurance costs of   and  respectively 
partially offsetting the increase in non interest expense was a charge of  in fiscal for merger and acquisition expenses related to the attempted acquisition of ifsb 
much of the increase in the bank s operating expenses was a result of the investment made in fiscal and to grow the franchise 
during fiscal  in an effort to reduce non interest expenses  the bank implemented cost cutting strategies by outsourcing our atm driving technology as well as a number of corporate administrative functions 
income tax expense income tax expense was million for fiscal  a decline of  or  from million for fiscal as a result of a  recovery of income tax expense in fiscal attributable to the release of contingency reserves for closed tax examination years 
as a result the effective tax rate in fiscal was  compared to for fiscal it is anticipated that the effective tax rate for fiscal will be more comparative to that of fiscal liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measure of the bank s ability to generate adequate cash to meet financial obligations 
the principal cash requirements of a financial institution are to cover potential deposit outflows  fund increases in its loan and investment portfolios and cover its ongoing operating expenses 
the company s primary sources of funds are deposits  borrowed funds  principal and interest payments on loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities and fee income 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan and mortgage backed securities prepayments are strongly influenced by changes in general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 

table of contents management believes the bank s short term assets have sufficient liquidity to cover loan demand  potential fluctuations in deposit accounts and to meet other anticipated cash requirements 
in addition  as previously discussed  the bank has the ability to borrow funds from the fhlb ny to meet liquidity needs 
the bank monitors its liquidity utilizing guidelines that are contained in a policy developed by management of the bank and approved by the bank s board of directors 
the bank s several liquidity measurements are evaluated on a frequent basis 
the bank was in compliance with this policy as of march  congress eliminated the statutory liquidity requirement that required federal savings banks to maintain a minimum amount of liquid assets of between and  as determined by the director of the ots  the bank s primary federal regulator 
the bank is required to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure its safe and sound operation 
as a result of the elimination of the liquidity requirement  the bank manages its liquidity through a board approved liquidity policy 
the bank s most liquid assets are cash and short term investments 
the level of these assets is dependent on the bank s operating  investing and financing activities during any given period 
at march  and  assets qualifying for short term liquidity  including cash and short term investments  totaled million and million  respectively 
the levels of the bank s short term liquid assets are dependent on the bank s operating  financing and investing activities during any given period 
the most significant liquidity challenge the bank currently faces is the variability in its cash flows as a result of mortgage refinance activity 
as mortgage interest rates increase  customers refinance activities tend to decline  causing the cash flow from both the mortgage loan portfolio and the mortgage backed securities portfolio to decelerate 
the federal funds rate was raised in fiscal eight separate times resulting in an additional increase in the federal funds rate of basis points 
the federal funds rate was again raised in fiscal twice resulting in an additional increase in the federal funds rate of basis points 
while the bank experienced relatively high loan and securities repayments over the last two fiscal years primarily as a result of increased mortgage loan refinancing activity caused by the low longer term interest rate environment  management anticipates a leveling of these prepayments in fiscal as longer term rates remain at current levels or begin to climb the effect of which can hinder liquidity 
the consolidated statements of cash flows present the change in cash from operating  investing and financing activities 
during fiscal  cash and cash equivalents decreased by million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  representing primarily the disbursement of funds to originant loans held for sale 
net cash used in investing activities was million  which was primarily the result by repayments and maturities of loans and securities sales partially offset by disbursement for loan originations held for investments 
net cash used in financing activities was million  reflecting primarily net decreases in deposits and by repayments of borrowings from the fhlb ny 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the bank is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business in order to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate and liquidity risk 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  these instruments are not recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
such instruments primarily include lending commitments 
lending commitments include commitments to originate mortgage and consumer loans and commitments to fund unused lines of credit
