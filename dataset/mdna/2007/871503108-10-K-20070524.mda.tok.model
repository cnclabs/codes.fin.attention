in fiscal and  two distributors  ingram micro and tech data product management  each accounted for more than percent of our total net revenues 
in fiscal   and  one reseller  digital river  inc  accounted for more than percent of our total net revenues 
research and development we believe that technical leadership is essential to our success 
therefore  we expect to continue to commit substantial resources to research and development 
whether we maintain our technical leadership position will largely depend on our ability to enhance existing products  respond to changing customer requirements  and develop and introduce new products in a timely manner 
the symantec security response team is responsible for a significant component of our research and development efforts 
our security response experts  located at research centers throughout the world  are focused on collecting and analyzing the latest malware threats  ranging from network security threats and vulnerabilities to viruses and worms 
to simplify and speed up the delivery of security updates for our product offerings at the server  gateway  and desktop levels  we use our liveupdate tm technology

table of contents development of new data protection technologies for disk based data protection continued efforts to ensure regulatory compliance and enhanced disaster recovery symantec research labs  or srl  is a group designed to foster new technologies and products to help us maintain leadership in existing markets 
a key component of the srl is our advanced concepts group  which is focused on identifying new markets and quickly transforming ideas into products for those markets 
independent contractors are used for various aspects of the product development process 
in addition  elements of some of our products are licensed from third parties 
we had research and development expenses  exclusive of in process research and development associated with acquisitions  of million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal we believe that technical leadership is essential to our success and we expect to continue to commit substantial resources to research and development 
acquisitions our strategic technology acquisitions are designed to enhance the features and functionality of our existing products  as well as extend our product leadership 
we use strategic acquisitions to provide certain technology  people  and products for our overall product and services strategy 
we consider both time to market and potential market share gains when evaluating acquisitions of technologies  product lines  or companies 
we have completed a number of acquisitions of technologies  companies  and products in the past  and we have also disposed of technologies and products 
we may acquire and or dispose of other technologies  companies  and products in the future 
during fiscal  we completed the following acquisitions frontsecurity frontsecurity was acquired in february and develops proprietary risk software  assessment software  and content rich assessment tools that improve customers insight of risk  regulatory  compliance  and security control criteria for organizational information and business objectives 
company i company i is a united kingdom based professional services firm that we acquired in december the firm specializes in addressing key challenges associated with operating and managing a data center in the financial services industry 
company i expands the capability of symantec s global consulting services group to help clients manage it risk and cost  particularly in the data center 
for further discussion of our acquisitions  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
competition our markets are consolidating  are highly competitive  and are subject to rapid changes in technology 
our competitiveness depends on our ability to deliver products that meet our customers needs by enhancing our existing solutions and services and offering reliable  scalable  and standardized new solutions on a timely basis 
we believe that the principal competitive factors necessary to be successful in our industry also include integration of advanced technology  time to market  price  reputation  financial stability  breadth of product offerings  customer support  brand recognition  and effective sales and marketing efforts 
in addition to the competition we face from direct competitors  we face indirect or potential competition from application providers  operating system providers  network equipment manufacturers  and other oems  who may provide various solutions and functions in their current and future products 
we also compete for access to retail distribution channels and for the attention of customers at the retail level and in corporate accounts 
in addition  we compete with other software companies  operating system providers  network equipment manufacturers and other oems to acquire technologies  products  or companies and to publish software developed by third parties 
we also compete with other software companies in our effort to place our products on the computer equipment sold to consumers by oems 

table of contents the competitive environments in which each segment operates are described below consumer products some of the channels in which our consumer products are offered are highly competitive 
our competitors are sometimes intensely focused on customer acquisition  which has led such competitors to offer their technology for free  engage in aggressive marketing  or enter into competitive partnerships 
our primary competitors in the consumer products segment are mcafee  inc  microsoft corporation  and trend micro  inc 
there are also several smaller regional security companies that we compete against primarily in the emea and asia pacific japan regions 
during fiscal  microsoft launched a security suite that competes with our consumer products 
this security suite includes antispyware and antivirus features  pc tuneup  a managed two way firewall  and a backup utility 
in addition  microsoft has recently added security features to new versions of its operating system products that provide some of the same functions offered in our products 
security and data management in the security and data management markets  we compete against many companies that offer competing products to our technology solutions and competing services to our response and support services 
our primary competitors in the security market are mcafee  trend micro  cisco systems  inc  and microsoft 
there are also several smaller regional security companies that we compete against primarily in the emea and apj regions 
the market for data protection products is characterized by ongoing technological innovation 
many of our strategic partners offer software products that compete with our products or have announced their intention to focus on developing or acquiring their own backup  archive  and data restoration software products 
our primary competitors in the data protection business are international business machines corporation  or ibm  ca  inc  emc corporation  commvault systems  inc  and microsoft 
in the managed security services business  our primary competitors are verisign  inc and ibm 
recent security acquisitions and offerings by emc  ibm and microsoft are indicators of the move into the security market which could lead to the release of stand alone enterprise products or to the inclusion of security functionality in future versions of the operating system products 
with security being a required solution for enterprises of all sizes  we believe that product differentiation is essential for us to maintain our leadership position 
we are focused on integrating next generation technology capabilities into our solution set in order to differentiate ourselves from the competition 
data center management the markets for data center management are intensely competitive 
in the areas of storage management  application management and server management  our primary competitors are emc  ibm  hewlett packard company  or hp  sun microsystems  inc  oracle corporation  and microsoft 
services we believe that the principal competitive factors for our services segment include technical capability  customer responsiveness  and our ability to hire and retain talented and experienced services personnel 
our primary competitors in the services segment are emc  hp  ibm  and regional specialized consulting firms 
intellectual property protective measures we regard some of the features of our internal operations  software  and documentation as proprietary and rely on copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures  contractual arrangements  and 
table of contents other measures to protect our proprietary information 
our intellectual property is an important and valuable asset that enables us to gain recognition for our products  services  and technology and enhance our competitive position 
as part of our confidentiality procedures  we generally enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees  distributors  and corporate partners  and we enter into license agreements with respect to our software  documentation  and other proprietary information 
these license agreements are generally non transferable and have a perpetual term 
we also educate our employees on trade secret protection and employ measures to protect our facilities  equipment  and networks 
trademarks  patents  copyrights  and licenses symantec and the symantec logo are trademarks or registered trademarks in the us and other countries 
in addition to symantec and the symantec logo  we have used  registered  and or applied to register other specific trademarks and service marks to help distinguish our products  technologies  and services from those of our competitors in the us and foreign countries and jurisdictions 
we enforce our trademark  service mark  and trade name rights in the us and abroad 
the duration of our trademark registrations varies from country to country  and in the us we generally are able to maintain our trademark rights and renew any trademark registrations for as long as the trademarks are in use 
we have a number of us and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications  including patents and rights to patent applications acquired through strategic transactions  which relate to various aspects of our products and technology 
the duration of our patents is determined by the laws of the country of issuance and for the us is typically years from the date of issuance of the patent or years from the date of filing of the patent application resulting in the patent  which we believe is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products 
our products are protected under us and international copyright laws and laws related to the protection of intellectual property and proprietary information 
we take measures to label such products with the appropriate proprietary rights notices  and we actively enforce such rights in the us and abroad 
however  these measures may not provide sufficient protection  and our intellectual property rights may be challenged 
in addition  we license some intellectual property from third parties for use in our products  and generally must rely on the third party to protect the licensed intellectual property rights 
while we believe that our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property rights is important to our success  we also believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent  trademark  license  or other intellectual property right 
seasonality as is typical for many large software companies  our business is seasonal 
software license and maintenance orders are generally higher in our third and fourth fiscal quarters and lower in our first and second fiscal quarters 
a significant decline in license and maintenance orders is typical in the first quarter of our fiscal year as compared to license and maintenance orders in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year 
in addition  we generally receive a higher volume of software license and maintenance orders in the last month of a quarter  with orders concentrated in the later part of that month 
we believe that this seasonality primarily reflects customer spending patterns and budget cycles  as well as the impact of compensation incentive plans for our sales personnel 
revenue generally reflects similar seasonal patterns but to a lesser extent than orders because revenue is not recognized until an order is shipped or services are performed and other revenue recognition criteria are met 
employees as of march   we employed approximately  people worldwide  approximately percent of whom reside in the us approximately  employees work in sales  marketing  and related activities   in product development   in support and services  and  in management  manufacturing  and administration

item a 
risk factors a description of the risk factors associated with our business is set forth below 
the list is not exhaustive and you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock 
if we are unable to develop new and enhanced products and services that achieve widespread market acceptance  or if we are unable to continually improve the performance  features  and reliability of our existing products and services or adapt our business model to keep pace with industry trends  our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
our future success depends on our ability to respond to the rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing or introducing new products  product upgrades  and services on a timely basis 
we have in the past incurred  and will continue to incur  significant research and development expenses as we strive to remain competitive 
new product development and introduction involves a significant commitment of time and resources and is subject to a number of risks and challenges including managing the length of the development cycle for new products and product enhancements  which has frequently been longer than we originally expected adapting to emerging and evolving industry standards and to technological developments by our competitors and customers extending the operation of our products and services to new platforms and operating systems entering into new or unproven markets with which we have limited experience managing new product and service strategies  including integrating our various security and storage technologies  management solutions  customer service  and support into unified enterprise security and storage solutions incorporating acquired products and technologies trade compliance issues affecting our ability to ship new products developing or expanding efficient sales channels obtaining sufficient licenses to technology and technical access from operating system software vendors on reasonable terms to enable the development and deployment of interoperable products  including source code licenses for certain products with deep technical integration into operating systems in addition  if we cannot adapt our business models to keep pace with industry trends  our revenue could be negatively impacted 
in connection with our enterprise software offerings  we license our applications on a variety of bases  such as per server  per processor  or based on performance criteria such as per amount of data processed or stored 
if enterprises migrate towards solutions  such as virtualization  which allow enterprises to run multiple applications and operating systems on a single server and thereby reduce the number of servers they are required to own and operate  we may experience lower license revenues unless we are able to successfully change our enterprise licensing model to take into account the impact of these new solutions 

table of contents if we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges  or if our new products  product upgrades  and services are not technologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance  our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
fluctuations in demand for our products and services are driven by many factors  and a decrease in demand for our products could adversely affect our financial results 
we are subject to fluctuations in demand for our products and services due to a variety of factors  including competition  product obsolescence  technological change  budget constraints of our actual and potential customers  levels of broadband usage  awareness of security threats to it systems  and other factors 
while such factors may  in some periods  increase product sales  fluctuations in demand can also negatively impact our product sales 
as attention to security threats fluctuates  the growth rates in sales of security products have been impacted  particularly in our consumer products segment 
if demand for our products declines  our revenues and gross margin could be adversely affected 
we operate in a highly competitive environment  and our competitors may gain market share in the markets for our products that could adversely affect our business and cause our revenues to decline 
we operate in intensely competitive markets that experience rapid technological developments  changes in industry standards  changes in customer requirements  and frequent new product introductions and improvements 
if we are unable to anticipate or react to these competitive challenges or if existing or new competitors gain market share in any of our markets  our competitive position could weaken and we could experience a drop in revenues that could adversely affect our business and operating results 
to compete successfully  we must maintain a successful research and development effort to develop new products and services and enhance existing products and services  effectively adapt to changes in the technology or product rights held by our competitors  appropriately respond to competitive strategy  and effectively adapt to technological changes and changes in the ways that our information is accessed  used  and stored within our enterprise and consumer markets 
if we are unsuccessful in responding to our competitors or to changing technological and customer demands  we could experience a negative effect on our competitive position and our financial results 
our traditional competitors include independent software vendors that offer software products that directly compete with our product offerings 
in addition to competing with these vendors directly for sales to end users of our products  we compete with them for the opportunity to have our products bundled with the product offerings of our strategic partners such as computer hardware oems and isps 
our competitors could gain market share from us if any of these strategic partners replace our products with the products of our competitors or if they more actively promote our competitors products than our products 
in addition  software vendors who have bundled our products with theirs may choose to bundle their software with their own or other vendors software or may limit our access to standard product interfaces and inhibit our ability to develop products for their platform 
we face growing competition from network equipment and computer hardware manufacturers and large operating system providers 
these firms are increasingly developing and incorporating into their products data protection and storage and server management software that competes at some levels with our product offerings 
our competitive position could be adversely affected to the extent that our customers perceive the functionality incorporated into these products as replacing the need for our products 
microsoft has added remote access features to its operating systems and has made announcements of actual and anticipated product features and new product offerings that compete with a number of our product offerings 
in addition  we believe that microsoft has recently made changes to its operating systems that make it more difficult for independent security vendors to provide solutions for their customers 
we could be adversely affected if customers  particularly consumers  perceive that features incorporated into the microsoft operating system reduce the need for our products or if they prefer to purchase other microsoft products that are bundled with its operating systems and compete with our products 
another growing industry trend is the software as a service saas business model  whereby software vendors develop and host their applications for use by customers over the internet 
this allows enterprises to obtain the benefits of commercially licensed  internally operated software without the associated complexity or high initial set up and operational costs 
advances in the saas business model could enable the growth of our competitors and 
table of contents could affect the success of our traditional software licensing models 
we have recently released our own saas offerings  however  it is uncertain whether our saas strategy will prove successful or whether we will be able to successfully incorporate our saas offering into our current licensing models 
our inability to successfully develop and market saas product offerings could cause us to lose business to competitors 
many of our competitors have greater financial  technical  sales  marketing  or other resources than we do and consequently may have the ability to influence customers to purchase their products instead of ours 
we also face competition from many smaller companies that specialize in particular segments of the markets in which we compete 
if we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels effectively or if our partners choose not to market and sell our products to their customers  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we sell our products to customers around the world through multi tiered sales and distribution networks 
sales through these different channels involve distinct risks  including the following direct sales 
a significant portion of our revenues from enterprise products is derived from sales by our direct sales force to end users 
special risks associated with this sales channel include longer sales cycles associated with direct sales efforts difficulty in hiring  retaining  and motivating our direct sales force substantial amounts of training for sales representatives to become productive  including regular updates to cover new and revised products indirect sales channels 
a significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales through indirect channels  including distributors that sell our products to end users and other resellers 
this channel involves a number of risks  including our lack of control over the timing of delivery of our products to end users our resellers and distributors are not subject to minimum sales requirements or any obligation to market our products to their customers our reseller and distributor agreements are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated at any time without cause our resellers and distributors frequently market and distribute competing products and may  from time to time  place greater emphasis on the sale of these products due to pricing  promotions  and other terms offered by our competitors oem sales channels 
a significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales through our oem partners that incorporate our products into  or bundle our products with  their products 
our reliance on this sales channel involves many risks  including our lack of control over the shipping dates or volume of systems shipped our oem partners are generally not subject to minimum sales requirements or any obligation to market our products to their customers our oem partners may terminate or renegotiate their arrangements with us and new terms may be less favorable due  among other things  to an increasingly competitive relationship with certain partners sales through our oem partners are subject to changes in strategic direction  competitive risks  and other issues that could result in reduction of oem sales the development work that we must generally undertake under our agreements with our oem partners may require us to invest significant resources and incur significant costs with little or no associated revenues the time and expense required for the sales and marketing organizations of our oem partners to become familiar with our products may make it more difficult to introduce those products to the market 
table of contents our oem partners may develop  market  and distribute their own products and market and distribute products of our competitors  which could reduce our sales if we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels successfully  these channels may conflict with one another or otherwise fail to perform as we anticipate  which could reduce our sales and increase our expenses as well as weaken our competitive position 
some of our distribution partners have experienced financial difficulties in the past  and if our partners suffer financial difficulties in the future  we may have reduced sales or increased bad debt expense that could adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  reliance on multiple channels subjects us to events that could cause unpredictability in demand  which could increase the risk that we may be unable to plan effectively for the future  and could result in adverse operating results in future periods 
we have grown  and may continue to grow  through acquisitions that give rise to risks and challenges that could adversely affect our future financial results 
we have in the past acquired  and we expect to acquire in the future  other businesses  business units  and technologies 
acquisitions can involve a number of special risks and challenges  including complexity  time  and costs associated with the integration of acquired business operations  workforce  products  and technologies into our existing business  sales force  employee base  product lines  and technology diversion of management time and attention from our existing business and other business opportunities loss or termination of employees  including costs associated with the termination or replacement of those employees assumption of debt or other liabilities of the acquired business  including litigation related to the acquired business the incurrence of additional acquisition related debt as well as increased expenses and working capital requirements dilution of stock ownership of existing stockholders increased costs and efforts in connection with compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act substantial accounting charges for restructuring and related expenses  write off of in process research and development  impairment of goodwill  amortization of intangible assets  and stock based compensation expense integrating acquired businesses has been and will continue to be a complex  time consuming  and expensive process  and can impact the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
for example  as disclosed in item a in this annual report  we have remediated a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that was largely related to symantec having insufficient personnel resources with adequate expertise to properly manage the increased volume and complexity of income tax matters arising from the acquisition of veritas 
if integration of our acquired businesses is not successful  we may not realize the potential benefits of an acquisition or undergo other adverse effects that we currently do not foresee 
to integrate acquired businesses  we must implement our technology systems in the acquired operations and integrate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations 
we also must effectively integrate the different cultures of acquired business organizations into our own in a way that aligns various interests  and may need to enter new markets in which we have no or limited experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions 
any of the foregoing  and other factors  could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability from acquired businesses or to realize other anticipated benefits of acquisitions 
in addition  because acquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky  no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not adversely affect our business  operating results  or financial condition 

table of contents we have not historically maintained substantial levels of indebtedness  and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our liabilities 
in june  we sold billion in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes 
as a result of the sale of the notes  we have a substantially greater amount of long term debt than we have maintained in the past 
in addition  we have entered into a credit facility with a borrowing capacity of billion 
our credit facility allows us immediate access to domestic funds if we identify opportunities for its use 
we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future 
our maintenance of substantial levels of debt could adversely affect our flexibility to take advantage of certain corporate opportunities and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our international operations involve risks that could increase our expenses  adversely affect our operating results  and require increased time and attention of our management 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers located outside of the us and we have significant operations outside of the us  including engineering  sales  customer support  and production 
we plan to expand our international operations  but such expansion is contingent upon the financial performance of our existing international operations as well as our identification of growth opportunities 
our international operations are subject to risks in addition to those faced by our domestic operations  including potential loss of proprietary information due to misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights than us laws requirements of foreign laws and other governmental controls  including trade and labor restrictions and related laws that reduce the flexibility of our business operations regulations or restrictions on the use  import  or export of encryption technologies that could delay or prevent the acceptance and use of encryption products and public networks for secure communications central bank and other restrictions on our ability to repatriate cash from our international subsidiaries or to exchange cash in international subsidiaries into cash available for use in the us fluctuations in currency exchange rates and economic instability such as higher interest rates in the us and inflation that could reduce our customers ability to obtain financing for software products or that could make our products more expensive or could increase our costs of doing business in certain countries limitations on future growth or inability to maintain current levels of revenues from international sales if we do not invest sufficiently in our international operations longer payment cycles for sales in foreign countries and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable difficulties in staffing  managing  and operating our international operations  including difficulties related to administering our stock plans in some foreign countries difficulties in coordinating the activities of our geographically dispersed and culturally diverse operations seasonal reductions in business activity in the summer months in europe and in other periods in other countries reduced sales due to the failure to obtain any required export approval of our technologies  particularly our encryption technologies costs and delays associated with developing software in multiple languages political unrest  war  or terrorism  particularly in areas in which we have facilities a significant portion of our transactions outside of the us are denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  our future operating results will continue to be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates 
we may be negatively affected by fluctuations in foreign currency rates in the future  especially if international sales continue to grow as a percentage of our total sales 

table of contents the level of corporate tax from sales to our non us customers is less than the level of tax from sales to our us customers 
this benefit is contingent upon existing tax regulations in the us and in the countries in which our international operations are located 
future changes in domestic or international tax regulations could adversely affect our ability to continue to realize these tax benefits 
our products are complex and operate in a wide variety of computer configurations  which could result in errors or product failures 
because we offer very complex products  undetected errors  failures  or bugs may occur  especially when products are first introduced or when new versions are released 
our products are often installed and used in large scale computing environments with different operating systems  system management software  and equipment and networking configurations  which may cause errors or failures in our products or may expose undetected errors  failures  or bugs in our products 
our customers computing environments are often characterized by a wide variety of standard and non standard configurations that make pre release testing for programming or compatibility errors very difficult and time consuming 
in addition  despite testing by us and others  errors  failures  or bugs may not be found in new products or releases until after commencement of commercial shipments 
in the past  we have discovered software errors  failures  and bugs in certain of our product offerings after their introduction and  in some cases  may have experienced delayed or lost revenues as a result of these errors 
errors  failures  or bugs in products released by us could result in negative publicity  product returns  loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products  loss of competitive position  or claims by customers or others 
many of our end user customers use our products in applications that are critical to their businesses and may have a greater sensitivity to defects in our products than to defects in other  less critical  software products 
in addition  if an actual or perceived breach of information integrity or availability occurs in one of our end user customer s systems  regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products  the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed 
alleviating any of these problems could require significant expenditures of our capital and other resources and could cause interruptions  delays  or cessation of our product licensing  which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and could adversely affect our operating results 
if we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees  lose key personnel  fail to integrate replacement personnel successfully  or fail to manage our employee base effectively  we may be unable to develop new and enhanced products and services  effectively manage or expand our business  or increase our revenues 
our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain our key management  technical  sales  marketing  finance  and other critical personnel 
our officers and other key personnel are employees at will  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain them 
competition for people with the specific skills that we require is significant 
in order to attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace  we believe that we must provide a competitive compensation package  including cash and equity based compensation 
the volatility in our stock price may from time to time adversely affect our ability to recruit or retain employees 
in addition  we may be unable to obtain required stockholder approvals of future increases in the number of shares available for issuance under our equity compensation plans  and recent changes in accounting rules require us to treat the issuance of employee stock options and other forms of equity based compensation as compensation expense 
as a result  we may decide to issue fewer equity based incentives and may be impaired in our efforts to attract and retain necessary personnel 
if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees  or conversely  if we fail to manage employee performance or reduce staffing levels when required by market conditions  our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
key personnel have left our company in the past and there likely will be additional departures of key personnel from time to time in the future 
the loss of any key employee could result in significant disruptions to our operations  including adversely affecting the timeliness of product releases  the successful implementation and completion of company initiatives  the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting  and the results of our operations 
in addition  hiring  training  and successfully integrating replacement sales and other personnel could be time consuming  may cause additional disruptions to our operations  and may be unsuccessful  which could negatively impact future revenues 

table of contents we are a party to several class action lawsuits  which could require significant management time and attention and result in significant legal expenses  and which could  if not determined favorably  negatively impact our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
we have been named as a party to class action lawsuits  and we may be named in additional litigation 
the expense of defending such litigation may be costly and divert management s attention from the day to day operations of our business  which could adversely affect our business  results of operations  and cash flows 
in addition  an unfavorable outcome in such litigation could negatively impact our business  results of operations  and cash flows 
third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products 
from time to time  we receive claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others  including claims regarding patents  copyrights  and trademarks 
in addition  former employers of our former  current  or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us the confidential or proprietary information of these former employers 
any such claim  with or without merit  could result in costly litigation and distract management from day to day operations 
if we are not successful in defending such claims  we could be required to stop selling  delay shipments of  or redesign our products  pay monetary amounts as damages  enter into royalty or licensing arrangements  or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers 
in addition  we license and use software from third parties in our business 
these third party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all  and may expose us to additional liability 
this liability  or our inability to use any of this third party software  could result in shipment delays or other disruptions in our business that could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
if we do not protect our proprietary information and prevent third parties from making unauthorized use of our products and technology  our financial results could be harmed 
most of our software and underlying technology are proprietary 
we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of confidentiality agreements and procedures and through copyright  patent  trademark  and trade secret laws 
however  all of these measures afford only limited protection and may be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented by third parties 
third parties may copy all or portions of our products or otherwise obtain  use  distribute  and sell our proprietary information without authorization 
third parties may also develop similar or superior technology independently by designing around our patents 
our shrink wrap license agreements are not signed by licensees and therefore may be unenforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions 
furthermore  the laws of some foreign countries do not offer the same level of protection of our proprietary rights as the laws of the us  and we may be subject to unauthorized use of our products in those countries 
the unauthorized copying or use of our products or proprietary information could result in reduced sales of our products 
any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in with a strategic partner or vendor could adversely affect our ability to access software  operating system  and hardware platforms of such partner or vendor  or cause such partner or vendor to choose not to offer our products to their customers 
in addition  any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in  alone or through our alliances with the business software alliance bsa  or the software information industry association siia  could be costly  may distract management from day to day operations  and may lead to additional claims against us  which could adversely affect our operating results 
some of our products contain open source software  and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business 
certain of our products are distributed with software licensed by its authors or other third parties under so called open source licenses  which may include  by way of example  the gnu general public license gpl  gnu lesser general public license lgpl  the mozilla public license  the bsd license  and the apache license 
some of these licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or 
table of contents derivative works we create based upon the open source software  and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use 
if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner  we could  under certain of the open source licenses  be required to release the source code of our proprietary software 
in addition to risks related to license requirements  usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third party commercial software  as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software 
we have established processes to help alleviate these risks  including a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source  but we cannot be sure that all open source is submitted for approval prior to use in our products 
in addition  many of the risks associated with usage of open source cannot be eliminated  and could  if not properly addressed  negatively affect our business 
our software products and website may be subject to intentional disruption that could adversely impact our reputation and future sales 
although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to prevent intentional disruptions  we expect to be an ongoing target of attacks specifically designed to impede the performance of our products 
similarly  experienced computer programmers may attempt to penetrate our network security or the security of our website and misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions of our services 
because the techniques used by such computer programmers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques 
our activities could be adversely affected and our reputation and future sales harmed if these intentionally disruptive efforts are successful 
increased customer demands on our technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results 
we offer technical support services with many of our products 
we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short term increases in customer demand for support services 
we also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by competitors or successfully integrate support for our customers 
further customer demand for these services  without corresponding revenues  could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results 
we have outsourced a substantial portion of our worldwide consumer support functions to third party service providers 
if these companies experience financial difficulties  do not maintain sufficiently skilled workers and resources to satisfy our contracts  or otherwise fail to perform at a sufficient level under these contracts  the level of support services to our customers may be significantly disrupted  which could materially harm our relationships with these customers 
accounting charges may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial results 
our financial results have been in the past  and may continue to be in the future  materially affected by non cash and other accounting charges  including amortization of intangible assets  including acquired product rights impairment of goodwill stock based compensation expense restructuring charges impairment of long lived assets for example  in connection with our acquisition of veritas  we have recorded approximately billion of acquired product rights and other intangible assets and billion of goodwill 
we have recorded and will continue to record future amortization charges with respect to a portion of these intangible assets and stock based compensation expense related to the stock options to purchase veritas common stock assumed by us 
in addition  we will evaluate our long lived assets  including property and equipment  goodwill  acquired product rights  and other intangible assets  whenever events or circumstances occur which indicate that these assets might be impaired 

table of contents goodwill is evaluated annually for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if events and circumstances warrant  and our evaluation depends to a large degree on estimates and assumptions made by our management 
our assessment of any impairment of goodwill is based on a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units to the carrying value of that reporting unit 
our determination of fair value relies on management s assumptions of our future revenues  operating costs  and other relevant factors 
if management s estimates of future operating results change  or if there are changes to other assumptions such as the discount rate applied to future operating results  the estimate of the fair value of our reporting units could change significantly  which could result in a goodwill impairment charge 
the foregoing types of accounting charges may also be incurred in connection with or as a result of other business acquisitions 
the price of our common stock could decline to the extent that our financial results are materially affected by the foregoing accounting charges 
our effective tax rate may increase  which could increase our income tax expense and reduce our net income 
our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors  many of which are outside of our control  including changes in the relative proportions of revenues and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates changing tax laws  regulations  and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate as well as the requirements of certain tax rulings the tax effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions and restructuring charges that may cause fluctuations between reporting periods tax assessments  or any related tax interest or penalties  could significantly affect our income tax expense for the period in which the settlements take place 
the price of our common stock could decline if our financial results are materially affected by an adverse change in our effective tax rate 
we report our results of operations based on our determinations of the amount of taxes owed in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
from time to time  we receive notices that a tax authority to which we are subject has determined that we owe a greater amount of tax than we have reported to such authority  and we are regularly engaged in discussions  and sometimes disputes  with these tax authorities 
we are engaged in disputes of this nature at this time 
if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed in any of these jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for  our operating results  cash flows  and financial condition could be adversely affected 
fluctuations in our quarterly financial results have affected the price of our common stock in the past and could affect our stock price in the future 
our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control and which could adversely affect our operations and operating results 
if our quarterly financial results or our predictions of future financial results fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  our stock price could be negatively affected 
any volatility in our quarterly financial results may make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future or pursue acquisitions that involve issuances of our stock 
our operating results for prior periods may not be effective predictors of our future performance 
factors associated with our industry  the operation of our business  and the markets for our products may cause our quarterly financial results to fluctuate  including reduced demand for any of our products entry of new competition into our markets 
table of contents competitive pricing pressure for one or more of our classes of products our ability to timely complete the release of new or enhanced versions of our products the number  severity  and timing of threat outbreaks eg worms and viruses our resellers making a substantial portion of their purchases near the end of each quarter enterprise customers tendency to negotiate site licenses near the end of each quarter cancellation  deferral  or limitation of orders by customers fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates movement in interest rates the rate of adoption of new product technologies and new releases of operating systems weakness or uncertainty in general economic or industry conditions in any of the multiple markets in which we operate that could reduce customer demand and ability to pay for our products and services political and military instability  which could slow spending within our target markets  delay sales cycles  and otherwise adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and operate effectively budgetary constraints of customers  which are influenced by corporate earnings and government budget cycles and spending objectives disruptions in our highly automated business operations caused by  among other things  earthquakes  floods  or other natural disasters affecting our headquarters located in silicon valley  california  an area known for seismic activity  or our other locations worldwide acts of war or terrorism intentional disruptions by third parties any of the foregoing factors could cause the trading price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly 
our stock price may be volatile in the future  and you could lose the value of your investment 
the market price of our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future  and as a result you could lose the value of your investment 
the market price of our common stock may be affected by a number of factors  including announcements of quarterly operating results and revenue and earnings forecasts by us that fail to meet or be consistent with our earlier projections or the expectations of our investors or securities analysts announcements by either our competitors or customers that fail to meet or be consistent with their earlier projections or the expectations of our investors or securities analysts rumors  announcements  or press articles regarding our or our competitors operations  management  organization  financial condition  or financial statements changes in revenue and earnings estimates by us  our investors  or securities analysts accounting charges  including charges relating to the impairment of goodwill announcements of planned acquisitions by us or by our competitors announcements of new or planned products by us  our competitors  or our customers gain or loss of a significant customer inquiries by the sec  nasdaq  law enforcement  or other regulatory bodies acts of terrorism  the threat of war  and other crises or emergency situations 
table of contents economic slowdowns or the perception of an oncoming economic slowdown in any of the major markets in which we operate the stock market in general  and the market prices of stocks of technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price volatility that has adversely affected  and may continue to adversely affect  the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our business or operating results 
problems with our information systems could interfere with our business and operations 
we rely on our information systems and those of third parties for processing customer orders  shipping of products  providing services and support to our customers  billing and tracking our customers  fulfilling contractual obligations  and otherwise running our business 
any disruption in our information systems and those of the third parties upon whom we rely could have a significant impact on our business 
in addition  we are in the process of enhancing our information systems 
the implementation of these types of enhancements is frequently disruptive to the underlying business of an enterprise  which may especially be the case for us due to the size and complexity of our businesses 
any disruptions relating to our systems enhancements  particularly any disruptions impacting our operations during the implementation period  could adversely affect our business in a number of respects 
even if we do not encounter these adverse effects  the implementation of these enhancements may be much more costly than we anticipated 
if we are unable to successfully implement the information systems enhancements as planned  our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows could be negatively impacted

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our business symantec is a global leader in infrastructure software  enabling businesses and consumers to have confidence in a connected world 
we help our customers protect their infrastructure  information  and interactions by delivering software and services that address risks to information security  availability  compliance  and information technology  or it  systems performance 
we strive to help our customers manage compliance  complexity  and cost by protecting their it infrastructure as they seek to maximize value from their it investments 
we deliver a comprehensive and diverse set of security and availability products and services to a wide range of customers  including large enterprises  governments  small and medium sized businesses  and consumers 
our delivery network includes direct  inside  and channel sales resources which support our ecosystem of more than  partners across the world  as well as various relationships with original equipment manufacturers  or oems  internet service providers  or isps  and retail and online stores 
founded in  we have operations in countries 
we have a week fiscal accounting year 
accordingly  all references as of and for the fiscal years ended march    and reflect amounts as of and for the periods ended march   march   and april   respectively  each of which consisted of weeks 
our operating segments are significant strategic business units that offer different products and services  distinguished by customer needs 
in the june quarter  we consolidated our enterprise security  data protection  and storage and server management segments into two segments the security and data management segment and the data center management segment 
amounts for the years ended march  and have been reclassified to conform to our current presentation 
as of march   we had five operating segments  descriptions of which are provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
on july   we completed the acquisition of veritas  whereby veritas became a wholly owned subsidiary of symantec in a transaction accounted for using the purchase method 
the results of veritas operations have been included in our results of operations beginning on july   and have had a significant impact on our revenues  cost of revenues  and operating expenses since the date of acquisition 
on april   we completed our acquisition of altiris  inc  a leading provider of it management software that enables businesses to easily manage and service network based endpoints 
the aggregate purchase price  excluding acquisition related costs  was approximately million in cash  which amount was net of altiris cash balance 
we believe this acquisition will enable us to help customers better manage and enforce security policies at the endpoint  identify and protect against threats  and repair and service assets 
the altiris business will constitute a new business segment in fiscal we will also move our ghost  pcanywhere  and livestate delivery products from the security and data management segment to the altiris segment 
in addition  we will move our managed security services  deepsight  and software as a service products and services from the security and data management segment to the services segment 
financial results and trends our net income was million for fiscal as compared to million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the higher net income for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to the write off in fiscal of million of acquired in process research and development  or ipr d  as a result of the veritas acquisition for which there is no comparable charge in fiscal this increase was partially offset by million of stock based compensation expense related to our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment  effective april   higher employee compensation costs resulting from increased employee headcount  and million of restructuring charges 
as of march   employee headcount had increased by approximately from march  during fiscal  we delivered revenue growth across all of our geographic regions as compared to fiscal and the overall growth is due primarily to the veritas acquisition  which was included in our results for 
table of contents the full year in fiscal as compared to only the nine months subsequent to the acquisition date of july  in fiscal we believe our revenue growth is also partly attributable to increased awareness of internet related threats around the world and demand for storage solutions 
weakness in the us dollar compared to foreign currencies positively impacted our international revenue growth by million in fiscal compared to fiscal we are unable to predict the extent to which revenues in future periods will be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
if international sales become a greater portion of our total sales in the future  changes in foreign exchange rates may have a potentially greater impact on our revenues and operating results 
although revenue for fiscal was higher than revenue for fiscal and  certain portions of our business are maturing and our rate of revenue growth is slowing for several reasons 
during fiscal  particularly in the december and march quarters  we provided more flexibility in our contract terms and in product deployments and provided more services in combination with licenses  we experienced an increase in the value of multi year arrangements compared to prior periods  particularly within our data center management segment  and we had a large number of maintenance renewals 
these changes resulted in a greater percentage of revenue being deferred and recognized over an extended period of time 
in addition  in the december quarter we combined the legacy buying programs of symantec and veritas into one buying program for all of our enterprise offerings  which resulted in a change in the vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of pricing for our storage and availability offerings 
additional information regarding factors that we believe impacted net revenue during fiscal is discussed under total net revenues below 
in light of the foregoing factors and our slowing rate of revenue growth  we implemented a cost savings initiative in the fourth quarter of fiscal to better align our expenses with our new revenue expectations 
the cost savings initiative included a workforce reduction of approximately five percent worldwide 
once these cost reductions are fully implemented  we expect to save approximately million in costs on an annualized basis and to have a lower rate of operating expense growth than in recent periods 
the cost savings initiative resulted in a restructuring charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal we expect that the cost savings initiative will result in an additional restructuring charge in the first quarter of fiscal and potentially in other future periods 
we expect our gross margins and operating expenses to be affected in future periods as a result of recent changes in the terms of some of our key oem relationships 
we have negotiated new contract terms with some of our oem partners  which will result in payments to oem partners being included as operating expenses rather than cost of revenues 
in general  payments to oems made on a placement fee per unit basis will be treated as operating expenses  while payments based on a revenue sharing model will be amortized as cost of revenues 
as a result  we expect cost of revenues to decrease and we expect operating expenses to increase 
the increase in operating expenses will more than offset the decrease in cost of revenues because placement fee arrangements are expensed on an estimated average cost basis  while revenue sharing arrangements are amortized ratably over a one year period  and because payments to oems have increased 
cash flows were strong in fiscal as we achieved billion in operating cash flow 
we ended fiscal with billion in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
in addition  during fiscal we repurchased million shares of our common stock at prices ranging from to per share for an aggregate amount of billion 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates  which include judgments and assumptions  that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly 
historically  our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions 
if actual results differ from these estimates and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statements of income  and in certain situations  could have a material adverse effect on liquidity and our financial condition 

table of contents a critical accounting estimate is based on judgments and assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made 
different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in accounting estimates could materially impact the financial statements 
we believe that the estimates described below represent our critical accounting estimates  as they have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we also refer you to our summary of significant accounting policies included in the consolidated financial statements in this annual report 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that have been prescribed for the software industry 
primarily  we recognize revenue pursuant to the requirements of statement of position  or sop  software revenue recognition  issued by the american institute of certified public accountants  and any applicable amendments or modifications 
revenue recognition requirements in the software industry are very complex and require us to make many estimates 
in arrangements that include multiple elements  including perpetual software licenses and maintenance and or services  and packaged products with content updates  we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on vsoe of the fair value of the undelivered elements  and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue 
our deferred revenue consists primarily of the unamortized balance of enterprise product maintenance  consumer product content updates  and arrangements where vsoe does not exist 
deferred revenue totaled approximately billion as of march   of which million was presented as long term deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets 
vsoe of each element is based on the price for which the undelivered element is sold separately 
we determine fair value of the undelivered elements based on historical evidence of our stand alone sales of these elements to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the undelivered elements 
when vsoe does not exist for undelivered items such as maintenance  then the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period 
changes to the elements in a software arrangement  the ability to identify vsoe for those elements  the fair value of the respective elements  changes to a product s estimated life cycle  and increasing flexibility in contractual arrangements could materially impact the amount of recognized and deferred revenue 
for our consumer products that include content updates  we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the subscription upon sell through to end users 
associated cost of revenues is also recorded ratably 
we record as deferred revenue and inventory the respective revenue and cost of revenue amounts of unsold product held by our distributors and resellers 
we expect our distributors and resellers to maintain adequate inventory of consumer packaged products to meet future customer demand  which is generally four or six weeks of customer demand based on recent buying trends 
we ship product to our distributors and resellers at their request and based on their valid purchase orders 
our distributors and resellers base the quantity of their orders on their estimates to meet future customer demand  which may exceed our expected level of a four or six week supply 
we offer limited rights of return if the inventory held by our distributors and resellers is below the expected level of a four or six week supply 
we estimate future returns under these limited rights of return in accordance with sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
we typically offer liberal rights of return if inventory held by our distributors and resellers exceeds the expected level 
because we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of excess inventory that will be returned  we primarily offset deferred revenue against trade accounts receivable for the amount of revenue in excess of the expected inventory levels 
if we made different estimates  material differences may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues and cost of revenues for any period presented 
reserves for product returns we reserve for estimated product returns as an offset to revenue based primarily on historical trends 
we fully reserve for obsolete products in the distribution channels as an offset to deferred revenue 
if we made different estimates  material differences could result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for any period presented 
more or less product may be returned than what was estimated and or the amount of inventory in the channel could 
table of contents be different than what was estimated 
these factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make actual results differ from our return estimates 
reserves for rebates we estimate and record reserves for channel and end user rebates as an offset to revenue 
for consumer products that include content updates  rebates are recorded as a ratable offset to revenue over the term of the subscription 
our estimated reserves for channel volume incentive rebates are based on distributors and resellers actual performance against the terms and conditions of volume incentive rebate programs  which are typically entered into quarterly 
our reserves for end user rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the promotional programs  actual sales during the promotion  amount of actual redemptions received  historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program  and the value of the rebate 
we also consider current market conditions and economic trends when estimating our reserves for rebates 
if we made different estimates  material differences may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for any period presented 
business combinations when we acquire businesses  we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill 
the allocation of the purchase price requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  especially with respect to intangible assets 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies 
these estimates can include  but are not limited to  the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future  the appropriate weighted average cost of capital  and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
in addition  unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates 
at march   goodwill was billion  other intangible assets  net were billion  and acquired product rights  net were million 
we assess goodwill for impairment within our reporting units annually or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units  which are the same as our operating segments  to its carrying value  including the goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 
to determine the reporting units fair value in the current year evaluation  we used the income approach under which we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit based on the estimated discounted future cash flows of that unit 
our cash flow assumptions are based on historical and forecasted revenue  operating costs  and other relevant factors 
if management s estimates of future operating results change  or if there are changes to other assumptions  the estimate of the fair value of our goodwill could change significantly 
such change could result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods  which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we assess the impairment of acquired product rights and other identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the sum of the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount 
such impairment loss would be measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value 
our cash flow assumptions are based on historical and forecasted revenue  operating costs  and other relevant factors 
if management s estimates of future operating results change  or if there are changes to other assumptions  the estimate of the fair value of our acquired product rights and other identifiable intangible assets could change significantly 
such change could result in impairment charges in future periods  which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
accounting for excess facilities we have estimated expenses for excess facilities related to consolidating  moving  and relocating personnel or sites as a result of restructuring activities and business acquisitions 
in determining our estimates  we obtain information from third party leasing agents to calculate anticipated third party sublease income and the vacancy 
table of contents period prior to finding a sub lessee 
market conditions may affect our ability to sublease facilities on terms consistent with our estimates 
our ability to sublease facilities on schedule or to negotiate lease terms resulting in higher or lower sublease income than estimated may affect our accrual for site closures 
in addition  differences between estimated and actual related broker commissions  tenant improvements  and related exit costs may increase or decrease our accrual upon final negotiation 
if we made different estimates regarding these various components of our excess facilities costs  the amount recorded for any period presented could vary materially from those actually recorded 
stock based compensation effective april   we adopted the provisions of  and accounted for stock based compensation in accordance with  sfas no 
r 
under sfas no 
r  we must measure the fair value of all stock based awards  including stock options  restricted stock units  or rsus  and purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan  or espp  on the date of grant and amortize the fair value of the award over the requisite service period 
we elected the modified prospective application method  under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
the valuation provisions of sfas no 
r apply to new awards and to awards that were outstanding as of the effective date and are subsequently modified 
for stock based awards granted on or after april   we recognize stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
we also recognize estimated compensation expense for the unvested portion of awards that were outstanding as of the effective date on a straight line basis over the remaining service period using the compensation costs estimated for the sfas no 
pro forma disclosures 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
the determination of the fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rates  and expected dividends 
we estimate the expected life of options granted based on an analysis of our historical experience of employee exercise and post vesting termination behavior considered in relation to the contractual life of the option 
expected volatility is based on the average of historical volatility for the period commensurate with the expected life of the option and the implied volatility of traded options 
the risk free interest rate is equal to the us treasury constant maturity rates for the period equal to the expected life 
we do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future 
accordingly  our expected dividend yield is zero 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we estimate forfeitures of options  rsus  and espp purchase rights at the time of grant based on historical experience and record compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
all stock based awards are amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the amount of such expense recorded in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable  characteristics not present in our option grants 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes and lattice binomial models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination  or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future 
certain stock based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that is significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 

table of contents the application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
there are significant differences among valuation models  and there is a possibility that we will adopt different valuation models in the future 
this may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of stock based payments 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods  and assumptions 
stock based compensation expense related to employee stock options  rsus  and employee stock purchases recognized under sfas no 
r for the year ended march  was million 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding sfas no 
r disclosures 
income taxes we are required to compute our income taxes in each federal  state  and international jurisdiction in which we operate 
this process requires that we estimate the current tax exposure as well as assess temporary differences between the accounting and tax treatment of assets and liabilities  including items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes 
the income tax effects of the differences we identify are classified as current or long term deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
our judgments  assumptions  and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws  and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income 
we must also assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income and  based on this assessment  establish a valuation allowance  if required 
our determination of our valuation allowance is based upon a number of assumptions  judgments  and estimates  including forecasted earnings  future taxable income  and the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the valuation allowance in a period  we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease to our tax provision in our consolidated statements of income  or to goodwill to the extent that the valuation allowance related to tax attributes of the acquired entities 
we failed to file in a timely fashion the final pre acquisition tax return for veritas  and as a result  it is uncertain whether we can claim a lower tax rate on a dividend made from a veritas foreign subsidiary under the american jobs creation act of we are currently petitioning the irs for relief to allow us to claim the lower rate of tax 
because we were unable to obtain this relief prior to filing the veritas tax return in may  we have paid million of additional us taxes 
the potential outcomes with respect to our payment of this amount include if we ultimately obtain relief from the irs on this matter  the million that we paid in may will be refunded to us and we will use that amount to increase our income tax accrual for the veritas transfer pricing disputes 
for more information see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
if we ultimately do not receive relief from the irs on this matter  and we otherwise have an adjustment arising from the veritas transfer pricing disputes  then we would only owe additional tax with regard to such disputes to the extent that such adjustment is in excess of million 
if we ultimately do not receive relief from the irs on this matter  and we otherwise do not have an adjustment arising from the veritas transfer pricing disputes  then we would be required to adjust the purchase price of veritas to reflect a reduction in the amount of pre acquisition tax liabilities assumed  and we would be required to recognize an equal amount of income tax expense  up to million 
in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued interpretation no  or fin   accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of sfas no 
the provisions of fin are effective beginning in the first quarter of fiscal see newly adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements under summary of significant accounting policies included in the consolidated financial statements in this annual report for further discussion 

table of contents results of operations total net revenues year ended march  in thousands net revenues period over period increase we were required under purchase accounting rules to reduce the amount of veritas deferred revenue that we recorded in connection with our july acquisition of veritas to an amount equal to the fair value of our contractual obligation related to that deferred revenue 
a portion of the increase in revenue related to storage and availability products and services in fiscal is due to the fact that the amount of revenue recognized in fiscal was lower as a result of the purchase accounting adjustment relating to deferred revenue 
a majority of the increase in such revenue in fiscal is due to the fact that we had no such comparable revenue in fiscal for those storage and availability products and services obtained through our acquisition of veritas 
unless otherwise specified  storage and availability products and services include products and services obtained through our acquisition of veritas  and complementary products and services obtained or developed subsequent to such acquisition 
several factors have contributed to increased deferred revenue and lower current period revenue in fiscal in fiscal  we began negotiating more transactions that commit customers to multi year periods  offer more flexibility in contractual terms and in product deployments  and provide more services in combination with license and maintenance sales 
in the december quarter  we combined our buying programs for all of our enterprise offerings to provide our customers and partners a single vendor relationship and simplify the way we do business 
previously  our storage and availability products and services were sold under veritas pre merger buying programs  while our security products and services were sold under our historical buying programs 
these factors have resulted in  and will continue to result in  lower near term recognized revenue growth rates 
for example  an increase in multi year contracts results in a higher level of revenue attributable to content and or maintenance included in those transactions  which resulted in a larger portion of our revenues being recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement and a smaller portion being recognized in the current period 
more flexibility in contractual terms  such as installment payments  increases our deferred revenue as such flexibility may result in ratable recognition or recognition on a due and payable basis 
our customers have also requested increased flexibility in product deployments in site license arrangements 
this may result in an increase in deferred revenue and classification of all revenues associated with the specific contract as content  subscriptions  and maintenance revenue  which is recognized over time  as vsoe may not exist in certain types of flexible deployment contracts 
as a result of our initiative to offer customers a more comprehensive solution to protect and manage a global it infrastructure  we expect to see an increasing amount of services sold in conjunction with license and maintenance contracts 
inclusion of such services often results in increased deferred revenue and increased classification of revenues as content  subscriptions  and maintenance revenue  as vsoe may not exist for some of the services provided 
the combination of buying programs resulted in a change in the vsoe for some of our storage and availability products and services 
this change  coupled with increased maintenance renewals sold with a license component  resulted in a larger portion of revenues associated with contracts being classified as content  subscriptions  and maintenance revenue  which is subject to deferral  instead of licenses revenue  which is generally recognized immediately 
net revenues increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to the inclusion of the storage and availability products and services that were obtained through our acquisition of veritas for the full twelve months in the period compared to nine months in the period 
these products and services contributed million of net revenues in the june quarter for which there was no comparable revenue in the june quarter 
in addition  the purchase accounting adjustment contributed million cumulatively in the september  december  and march quarters as compared to the comparable quarters of the prior year 
the 
table of contents remainder of the revenue increase is due to increases in our consumer products revenue and services offerings of million and million  respectively  due to continued growth in demand 
the segment discussions that follow further describe the revenue increases 
these increases are partially offset by the effects of the increased flexibility in contract terms and the combination of our buying programs discussed above 
net revenues increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to the inclusion of the storage and availability products and services obtained through our acquisition of veritas 
these products and services contributed billion of net revenues in fiscal for which there was no comparable revenue in fiscal in addition  revenues from our enterprise security products increased million and revenues from our consumer products increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increased revenues from these products were due primarily to continued growth in demand for our enterprise virus protection and anti spam solutions as well as our consumer security protection products  as described further in the segment discussions that follow 
beginning in the december quarter  as a result of increases in future subscription pricing for our consumer products that include content updates  revenue for these products is recognized on a ratable basis over the term of the subscription 
content  subscriptions  and maintenance revenues year ended march  in thousands content  subscriptions  and maintenance revenues percentage of total net revenues period over period increase content  subscriptions  and maintenance revenue includes arrangements for software maintenance and technical support for our products  content and subscription services primarily related to our security products  revenue from arrangements where vsoe of the fair value of undelivered elements does not exist  and managed security services 
these arrangements are generally offered to our customers over a specified period of time and we recognize the related revenue ratably over the maintenance  subscription  or service period 
beginning with the release of our consumer products that include content updates in the december quarter  we recognize revenue related to these products ratably 
as a result  this revenue has been classified as content  subscriptions  and maintenance beginning in the december quarter 
in addition  as noted above  increased flexibility in contract terms and the combination of our buying programs in the december quarter have impacted revenue recognition 
these changes caused a larger portion of revenue associated with contracts to be classified as content  subscriptions  and maintenance revenue  which is subject to deferral  instead of licenses revenue  which is generally recognized immediately  as discussed above in total net revenues 
content  subscriptions  and maintenance revenue also includes professional services revenue  which consists primarily of the fees we earn related to consulting and educational services 
we generally recognize revenue from our professional services as the services are performed or upon written acceptance from customers  if applicable  assuming all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met 
content  subscriptions  and maintenance revenues increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to the inclusion of the storage and availability products and services obtained through our acquisition of veritas for the full twelve months in the period compared to nine months in the period 
these products and services contributed million of content  subscriptions  and maintenance revenues in the june quarter for which there was no comparable revenue in the june quarter 
in addition  in fiscal  content  subscriptions  and maintenance revenue related to our enterprise products increased million due to the fact that the amount of revenue recognized in the comparable period was lower as a result of the purchase accounting adjustment discussed under total net revenues above 
revenue related to our consumer products increased million as compared to the period due primarily to growth in norton internet security products and online revenues due to growth in the use of the internet  and increased awareness and sophistication of security threats 
enterprise products and services  excluding veritas related products and services  increased million as 
table of contents a result of growth in our maintenance renewals due to an increasing installed base  increased demand for our service offerings  other acquisitions  and the combination of our buying programs implemented in the december quarter  which impacted vsoe methodology and classification of licenses revenue and content  subscriptions  and maintenance revenue  as discussed above under total net revenues 
content  subscriptions  and maintenance revenues increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to the inclusion of the storage and availability products and services obtained through our acquisition of veritas 
these product and services contributed million of content  subscriptions  and maintenance revenues in fiscal for which there was no comparable revenue in fiscal in addition  in fiscal  content  subscriptions  and maintenance revenues related to our consumer security products increased million as compared to fiscal due primarily to the classification of million of consumer revenue as content  subscriptions  and maintenance rather than licenses in fiscal as a result of recognizing revenue from sales of consumer products that include content updates ratably beginning in the december quarter as discussed above 
revenue related to our enterprise security products increased million  primarily due to increased awareness of information security threats 
licenses revenue year ended march  in thousands licenses revenue percentage of total net revenues period over period increase decrease licenses revenue increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to the inclusion of the storage and availability products obtained through our acquisition of veritas for the full twelve months in the period compared to nine months in the period 
these products contributed million of licenses revenues in the june quarter for which there was no comparable revenue in the june quarter 
excluding this june contribution  license revenues were down significantly in both security and data management and data center management segments as a result of the increased flexibility in contract terms and the combination of our buying programs implemented in the december quarter  both of which caused a larger portion of contracts to be classified as content  subscriptions  and maintenance  which is subject to deferral  instead of licenses revenue  which is generally recognized immediately  as discussed above in total net revenues 
licenses revenue increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to the inclusion of the storage and availability products obtained through our acquisition of veritas 
these products contributed million of licenses revenue in fiscal for which there was no comparable revenue in fiscal our consumer products that include content updates were released in the december quarter  and we recognize revenue related to these products ratably as content  subscriptions  and maintenance revenues  which resulted in a decrease in licenses revenue of million in fiscal competitive pressures  a lack of high profile information security threat activity during fiscal  and to a lesser extent  a decrease in licensing of our enterprise security products  also partially offset the overall increase in licenses revenue 
net revenues by segment consumer products segment year ended march  in thousands consumer products revenues percentage of total net revenues period over period increase 
table of contents consumer products revenues increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase of million in revenue from our norton internet security products 
this increase was partially offset by aggregate decreases in revenue from our norton antivirus and norton system works tm products of million 
these decreases resulted from our customers continued migration to the norton internet security products  which offer broader protection to address the rapidly changing threat environment 
our electronic orders include oem subscriptions  upgrades  online sales  and renewals 
revenue from electronic orders which includes sales of our norton internet security products and our norton antivirus products grew by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal consumer products revenues increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase of million in revenue from our norton internet security products 
the majority of the increase in revenue was booked through electronic orders 
this increase was partially offset by the change in our consumer product revenue recognition model for our consumer products that include content updates 
beginning in the december quarter  as a result of increases in future subscription pricing for our consumer products that include content updates  revenue for these products is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription upon sell through to end users 
this change in our product revenue recognition model resulted in a reduction in consumer products revenues for fiscal in addition  revenue from our norton antivirus products decreased million as our customers migrated to the norton internet security products 
revenue from our electronic distribution channel grew by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal we believe that  in addition to the factors noted above  the lower growth rate in our consumer products segment was attributable to a reduced threat environment in fiscal compared to fiscal in addition  during fiscal  pricing for subscriptions increased while pricing in retail and online stores remained consistent or decreased 
security and data management segment year ended march  in thousands security and data management revenues percentage of total net revenues period over period increase security and data management revenues increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to the inclusion of the storage and availability products obtained through our acquisition of veritas for the full twelve months in the period compared to nine months in the period 
these products contributed million of security and data management revenue in the june quarter for which there was no comparable revenue in the june quarter 
in addition the purchase accounting adjustment  discussed under total net revenues above  contributed million cumulatively in the september  december  and march quarters as compared to the comparable quarters of the prior year

table of contents data center management segment year ended march  in thousands data center management revenues percentage of total net revenues period over period increase percentage not meaningful the data center management segment is comprised of storage and availability products 
the increase in data center management revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to the inclusion of storage and availability products obtained through our acquisition of veritas for the full twelve month period compared to nine months in the fiscal period 
these products contributed million of data center management revenue in the june quarter for which there was no comparable revenue in the june quarter 
the effect of the purchase accounting adjustment discussed under total net revenues above also contributed million to the increase in revenue in fiscal excluding the effects of the aforementioned items  revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal was relatively flat due to the combination of the buying programs for all of our enterprise offerings in the december quarter 
this combination resulted in lower recognized revenue and increased deferred revenue as discussed under total net revenues above 
in fiscal  the data center management segment was solely comprised of the storage and availability products obtained through our acquisition of veritas 
revenue from our data center management segment was million in fiscal and was comprised primarily of revenue related to storage foundation and server foundation product families and netbackup products of million and million  respectively 
services segment year ended march  in thousands services revenues percentage of total net revenues period over period increase percentage not meaningful revenue from our services segment increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to a million increase in security consulting services and the inclusion of the storage and availability services obtained through our acquisition of veritas for the full twelve months in the period compared to nine months in the period 
these acquired services offerings contributed million of services revenues in the june quarter for which there was no comparable revenue in the june quarter

these products and services contributed million of international revenues in the june quarter for which there was no comparable revenue in the june quarter 
in north america  these products contributed million in the june quarter for which there was no comparable revenue in the june quarter 
in addition  a portion of the revenue increase in fiscal is due to the fact that the amount of revenue recognized in the comparable period was lower as a result of the purchase accounting adjustment discussed under total net revenues above 
the purchase accounting adjustment increased fiscal revenues by million in north america and million in the international regions compared to fiscal growth in our consumer products segment  driven by norton internet security  resulted in a million increase in the international regions and a million increase in north america in fiscal revenues versus fiscal both domestic and international revenue from enterprise offerings were negatively impacted primarily due to the increased flexibility in our contract terms and the combination of our buying programs 
these changes resulted in a larger portion of contracts being subject to deferral and a correspondingly lower amount of revenue recognized in the current period  as discussed in total net revenues above 
foreign currencies had a favorable impact on net revenues of million in fiscal compared to fiscal international revenues increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to the inclusion of the storage and availability products and services obtained through our acquisition of veritas 
these product and services contributed million of international revenues for which there was no comparable revenue in fiscal increased sales of our norton internet security products in our consumer products segment and our antivirus 
table of contents and antispam products in our security and data management segment also contributed to the increase in net revenue in the international regions in fiscal  while the change to ratable revenue recognition with the release of the consumer products that include content updates partially offset this increase 
weakness in most major foreign currencies negatively impacted our international revenue growth by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal we are unable to predict the extent to which revenues in future periods will be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
if international sales become a greater portion of our total sales in the future  changes in foreign currency exchange rates may have a potentially greater impact on our revenues and operating results 
cost of revenues year ended march  in thousands cost of revenues gross margin period over period increase percentage not meaningful cost of revenues consists primarily of amortization of acquired product rights  fee based technical support costs  costs of billable services  payments to oems under revenue sharing arrangements  manufacturing and direct material costs  and royalties paid to third parties under technology licensing agreements 
gross margin increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to higher revenues more than offsetting year over year increases in services and technical support costs 
we anticipate that our net revenues from our services segment may grow to comprise a higher percentage of our total net revenues  which would have a negative impact on our gross margin  as our services typically have a higher cost of revenues than our software products 
gross margin was also impacted as the terms of several of our oem arrangements changed from revenue sharing arrangements to placement fee arrangements during fiscal placement fee arrangements are expensed on an estimated average cost basis  while revenue sharing arrangements are amortized ratably over a one year period 
gross margin decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to increased amortization of acquired product rights resulting from certain identifiable intangible assets acquired through the veritas acquisition

table of contents relative to fiscal and contributed of the related content  subscriptions  and maintenance revenue in fiscal in addition  costs related to our security services consulting and consumer products increased million and million  respectively 
we expect our gross margin and operating expenses to be affected in future periods as a result of recent changes in the terms of some of our key oem relationships 
we have negotiated new contract terms with some of our oem partners which will have the effect of moving our oem payments from cost of revenues to operating expenses 
our past oem payments were primarily revenue sharing arrangements  which were amortized to cost of revenues over a one year period 
several of the arrangements negotiated in late fiscal are placement fee arrangements  for which the costs are expensed on an estimated average cost basis

table of contents provision for income taxes year ended march  in thousands tax provision on earnings effective tax rate on earnings tax provision on repatriation total tax provision total effective tax rate our effective tax rate on income before income taxes was approximately   and in fiscal   and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for fiscal reflects the impact of non deductible stock based compensation and the fiscal and internal revenue service  or irs  audit settlement 
the effective tax rate for fiscal reflects the impact of the ipr d charges and other acquisition related charges that are nondeductible for tax reporting purposes  partially offset by foreign earnings taxed at a lower rate than the us tax rate  and the effect of the true up of taxes on repatriated earnings 
the effective tax rate in fiscal reflects the additional tax expense attributable to the million of foreign earnings that we repatriated under the american jobs creation act 
we believe realization of substantially all of our deferred tax assets as of march  of million  after application of the valuation allowance  is more likely than not based on the future reversal of temporary tax differences 
realization of approximately million of our deferred tax assets as of march  is dependent upon future taxable earnings exclusive of reversing temporary differences in certain foreign jurisdictions 
levels of future taxable income are subject to the various risks and uncertainties discussed in item a  risk factors  set forth in this annual report 
an additional valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets may be necessary if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we will assess the need for an additional valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
of the million total valuation allowance provided against our deferred tax assets  approximately million is attributable to acquisition related assets  the benefit of which will reduce goodwill when and if realized 
the valuation allowance decreased by million in fiscal  all of which was attributable to acquisition related assets  the benefit of which reduced goodwill

american jobs creation act of repatriation of foreign earnings in the march quarter  we repatriated million from certain of our foreign subsidiaries that qualified for the dividends received deduction under the provisions of the american jobs creation act of  or the jobs act  enacted in october we recorded a tax charge for this repatriation of million in the march quarter 
in may  clarifying language was issued by the us department of treasury and the irs with respect to the treatment of foreign taxes paid on the earnings repatriated under the jobs act and in september  additional clarifying language was issued regarding the treatment of certain deductions attributable to the earnings repatriation 
as a result of this clarifying language  we reduced the tax expense attributable to the repatriation by approximately million in fiscal  which reduced the cumulative tax charge on the repatriation to million 
other tax matters on march   we received a notice of deficiency from the irs claiming that we owe additional taxes  plus interest and penalties  for the and tax years based on an audit of veritas  which we acquired in july the incremental tax liability asserted by the irs with regard to the veritas claim was million  excluding penalties and interest 
the notice of deficiency primarily relates to transfer pricing in connection with a technology license agreement between veritas and a foreign subsidiary 
we do not agree with the irs position 
on june   we filed a petition with the us tax court to protest a notice of deficiency 
on august   the irs 
table of contents answered our petition and the case has been docketed for trial in us tax court 
in the march quarter  the irs agreed to dismiss any penalty assessment  and we have otherwise agreed to settle several of the lesser issues representing million of the total assessment for million of tax 
as a result  the outstanding issue represents million of tax 
no payments will be made on the assessment until the issue is definitively resolved 
if  upon resolution  we are required to pay an amount in excess of our provision for this matter  the incremental amounts due would be accounted for principally as additions to the veritas purchase price as an increase to goodwill 
any incremental interest accrued subsequent to the date of the veritas acquisition would be recorded as an expense in the period the matter is resolved 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we made million of tax related adjustments to the purchase accounting for veritas  consisting of million of additional pre acquisition tax reserve related adjustments  partially offset by a million reduction in other pre acquisition taxes payable 
while we strongly disagree with the irs over both its transfer pricing methodologies and the amount of the assessment  we have established additional tax reserves for all veritas pre acquisition years to account for both contingent tax and interest risk 
on march   we received notices of proposed adjustment from the irs with regard to an unrelated audit of symantec for fiscal and the irs claimed that we owed an incremental tax liability with regard to this audit of million  excluding penalties and interest 
the incremental tax liability primarily relates to transfer pricing matters between symantec and a foreign subsidiary 
on september   we executed a closing agreement with the irs with respect to the audit of symantec s fiscal and federal income tax returns 
the closing agreement represents the final assessment by the irs of additional tax for these fiscal years of approximately million  including interest 
based on the final settlement  a tax benefit of million was recognized 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we increased our tax reserves by an additional million in connection with all open symantec tax years fiscal to 
since these reserves relate to licensing arising from acquired technology  the additional accruals are primarily offset by deferred taxes 
we are as yet unable to confirm our eligibility to claim a lower tax rate on a distribution made from a veritas foreign subsidiary prior to the acquisition 
the distribution was intended to be made pursuant to the jobs act  and therefore eligible for a effective us federal rate of tax  in lieu of the statutory rate 
we are seeking a ruling from the irs on the matter 
because we were unable to obtain this ruling prior to filing the veritas tax return in may  we have paid million of additional us taxes 
since this payment relates to the taxability of foreign earnings that are otherwise the subject of the irs assessment  this additional payment reduced the amount of taxes payable accrued as part of the purchase accounting for pre acquisition contingent tax risks

holders of the senior notes may convert their senior notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances 
upon conversion  we would pay the holder the cash value of the applicable number of shares of symantec common stock  up to the principal amount of the note 
amounts in excess of the principal amount  if any  may be paid in cash or in stock at our option 
as of march   those circumstances had not occurred 
represents amounts associated with agreements that are enforceable  legally binding  and specify terms 
includes million related to facilities included in our restructuring reserve 
purchase price adjustment on december   we completed our acquisition of company i limited for million in cash 
the purchase price may be increased by up to million in cash if company i meets certain billings targets by september  payments of the additional consideration may be accelerated if certain billings targets are met by march  or september  under the terms of the purchase agreement  symantec has days from the respective dates to determine whether the billings target for payment of the additional consideration has been met 
any increase in the purchase consideration would result in a corresponding increase in goodwill 
we believe that it is not determinable beyond a reasonable doubt that the billing targets are met as of march  and therefore we have not booked an adjustment in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
development agreements during fiscal  we entered into agreements in connection with the construction of  or refurbishments to  buildings in springfield  oregon  and culver city  california 
payment is contingent upon the achievement of certain agreed upon milestones 
the remaining commitment under the culver city  california agreement is million as of march  as of march   the springfield  oregon project had been completed and there were no remaining commitments under that agreement 
royalties we have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products 
royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of underlying revenue 
certain 
table of contents royalty commitments have minimum commitment obligations  however  as of march  all such obligations are insignificant 
indemnification as permitted under delaware law  we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was  serving at our request in such capacity 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is not limited  however  we have directors and officers insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and may enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal 
we provide limited product warranties and the majority of our software license agreements contain provisions that indemnify licensees of our software from damages and costs resulting from claims alleging that our software infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party 
historically  payments made under these provisions have been insignificant 
we monitor the conditions that are subject to indemnification to identify if a loss has occurred

in june  the fasb issued fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
the interpretation contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and equity prices 
we may use derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain risks in accordance with our investment and foreign exchange policies 
we do not use derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our short term investment portfolio and the potential losses arising from changes in interest rates 
our investment objective is to achieve the maximum return compatible with capital preservation and liquidity requirements 
our strategy is to invest our cash in a manner that preserves capital  maintains sufficient liquidity to meet the cash requirements of the company  maximizes yields consistent with approved credit risk  and limits inappropriate concentrations of investment by sector  credit  or issuer

 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
we consider investments in instruments purchased with an original maturity of days or less to be cash equivalents

our cash equivalents and short term investment portfolios consist primarily of money market funds  commercial paper  corporate debt securities  asset backed debt securities  and us government and government sponsored debt securities

foreign currency exchange rate risk we conduct business in currencies through our worldwide operations and  as such  we are exposed to foreign currency exposure risk 
foreign currency risks are associated with our cash and cash equivalents  investments  receivables  and payables denominated in foreign currencies 
fluctuations in exchange rates will result in foreign exchange gains and losses on these foreign currency assets and liabilities and are included in other 
table of contents income expense  net 
our objective in managing foreign exchange activity is to preserve stockholder value by minimizing the risk of foreign currency exchange rate changes 
our strategy is to primarily utilize forward contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures 
under our program  gains and losses in our foreign currency exposures are offset by losses and gains on our forward contracts 
our forward contracts generally have terms of days or less 
at the end of the reporting period  open contracts are marked to market with unrealized gains and losses included in other income expense  net 
the following table presents a sensitivity analysis on our foreign forward exchange contract portfolio using a statistical model to estimate the potential gain or loss in fair value that could arise from hypothetical appreciation or depreciation of foreign currency in millions value of value of contracts contracts given x given x appreciation of depreciation of foreign foreign currency notional currency foreign forward exchange contracts amount purchased  march  sold  march  purchased  march  sold  march  equity price risk in june  we issued billion principal amount of convertible senior notes due and billion of convertible senior notes due holders may convert their senior notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances 
upon conversion  we would pay the holder the cash value of the applicable number of shares of symantec common stock  up to the principal amount of the note 
amounts in excess of the principal amount  if any  may be paid in cash or in stock at our option 
concurrent with the issuance of the senior notes  we entered into convertible note hedge transactions and separately  warrant transactions  to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the senior notes and to mitigate any negative effect such conversion may have on the price of our common stock 
for business and strategic purposes  we also hold equity interests in several privately held companies  many of which can be considered to be in the start up or development stages 
these investments are inherently risky and we could lose a substantial part or our entire investment in these companies 
these investments are recorded at cost and classified as other long term assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
as of march   these investments had an aggregate carrying value of million
