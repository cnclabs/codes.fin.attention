critical accounting policies general our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the financial information contained within our statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
for example  we use historical loss factors as one factor in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan portfolio 
actual losses could differ substantially from the historical factors that we use 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
although the economics of our transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact our transactions could change 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting i sfas no  accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when their occurrence is probable and estimable and ii sfas no  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of the collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 

table of contents we evaluate non performing loans individually for impairment  such as nonaccrual loans  loans past due days or more  restructured loans and other loans selected by management as required by sfas no 
the evaluations are based upon discounted expected cash flows or collateral valuations 
if the evaluation shows that a loan is individually impaired  then a specific reserve is established for the amount of the impairment 
if a loan evaluated individually is not impaired  then the loan is assessed for impairment under sfas no 
for loans without individual measures of impairment  we make estimates of losses for groups of loans as required by sfas no 
loans are grouped by similar characteristics  including the type of loan  the assigned loan grade and general collateral type 
a loss rate reflecting the expected loss inherent in a group of loans is derived based upon historical loss rates for each loan type  the predominant collateral type for the group and the terms of the loan 
the resulting estimates of losses for groups of loans are adjusted for relevant environmental factors and other conditions of the portfolio of loans including borrower or industry concentrations  levels and trends in delinquencies  charge offs and recoveries  changes in risk selection  level of experience  ability and depth of lending staff  and national and economic conditions 
the amounts of estimated losses for loans individually evaluated for impairment and groups of loans are added together for a total estimate of loan losses 
the estimate of losses is compared to our allowance for loan losses as of the evaluation date and  if the estimate of losses is greater that the allowance  an additional provision to the allowance would be made 
if the estimate of losses is less than the allowance  the degree to which the allowance exceeds the estimate is evaluated to determine whether a reduction to the allowance would be necessary 
while management uses the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the valuations 
such adjustments would be made in the relevant period and may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
executive overview growth in the loan portfolio of increased net interest income by for the year ended december  increased noninterest income of and controlled noninterest expense growth of contributed to an increase of in the net income 
while we were growing  we also worked through combining three banks into one bank in the first quarter and part of the second quarter 
this completed the streamlining of back office functions and allowed us to focus on a unified product offering throughout our market area 
in the third quarter of  we implemented a unique in virginia interest checking product  reward checking  to increase deposit growth and retain customers 
in december  we completed a stock issuance of million shares  or over million  net 
this increased capital positions us for future growth and acquisitions 
for the year ended december   we had net income of million  or per share on a basic and a diluted basis  an increase of from million and a per share increase of from per share on a basic and diluted basis for return on average assets roa for was compared to in the prior year  and the return on average equity roe was for compared to in core earnings during the period from to continued to improve as net interest income increased and noninterest income excluding realized gains on securities increased from the prior year 
the impact of the new one bank organization and the centralized backroom processing was lower noninterest expense in some categories in compared to printing and supplies expense was up  or thousand  and telephone increased  or thousand 
data processing expense decreased  or thousand  while consulting expense decreased  or thousand 
on the other hand  making the communities aware of our new name and rolling out a new product caused marketing expenses to increase by thousand  or 
while the year to year change in noninterest expense as a percent has been declining since  the increase in is well below the increases of in and in this reflects the effort we have made to build an efficient infrastructure and control expenses 

table of contents growth and positioning the company to grow are among the primary objectives of management 
in late  we opened a branch at central garage along the route corridor from richmond to tappahannock 
in  the branch produced a profit and contributed to the earnings of the company 
in december  our smallest branch airpark in hanover county was relocated to a larger office on a more accessible route in one of the fastest growing markets in hanover county 
this new kings charter office has two commercial loan officers and a large lobby  as well as accessible drive up windows which allows us to service our deposit customers while having better access to the business customers in the large business area in the vicinity 
with the economic growth up and down the interstate corridor from northern virginia to emporia and the growth in the hampton roads area up the interstate corridor  we see many opportunities to expand our footprint 
increased loan volume in and the associated increased net interest income reflect our recognition that growth will fuel future earnings 
in addition  the overall asset quality of the loan portfolio is near its highest level in our history 
throughout net interest margin decreased as interest income from loan growth was offset by higher cost deposits 
this will likely continue to influence earnings in early  if the federal reserve continues to leave interest rates at the level where they have been since mid this economic environment has slowed deposit growth and forced us  like many other banks  to look at more expensive funding sources to fund loan demand 
when the federal reserve starts to lower rates  probably in the second half of  this funding pressure may ease allowing us to re price deposits at lower rates and allow the net interest margin to expand

interest income interest expense net interest income provision for loan losses net interest income after provision for loan losses noninterest income noninterest expense income before applicable income taxes applicable income taxes net income net income per share  basic and diluted net interest income net interest income represents our gross profit margin and is defined as the difference between interest income and interest expense 
for comparative purposes  income from tax exempt securities is adjusted to a tax equivalent basis using the federal statutory tax rate of 
tax exempt securities income is further adjusted by the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act tefra adjustment for the disallowance as a deduction of a portion of total interest expense related to the ratio of average tax exempt securities to average total assets 
this adjustment results in tax exempt income and yields being presented on a basis comparable with income and yields from fully taxable earning assets 
net interest margin represents our net interest income divided by average earning assets 
changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as their respective yields and rates  have a significant impact on the level of net interest income

large dollar certificates of deposit are certificates issued in amounts of  or greater 

table of contents tax equivalent net interest income increased to million in from million in average earning asset growth of produced million of increased interest income  while interest bearing liabilities grew producing a million increase in interest expense 
the increase in net interest income resulted primarily from higher loan volume since rates were influenced by a tight and competitive market 
total average earning assets increased by million  all of which was accounted for by the growth in loans 
total average liabilities grew million  or  while the interest bearing liabilities component increased million 
average interest bearing deposits for were up only with consumers transferring money out of savings and money market accounts into higher yielding instruments 
regular certificates of deposit were up million and large dollar certificates were up million 
the growth in both of these deposit categories accounted for all the deposit increase and offset the decreases in other deposit categories 
part of the growth in large dollar certificates of deposit was the acquisition of million in brokered deposits which represent funding from outside the company s primary market area 
in addition  we used a new service  certificate of deposit account registry service known as cdars  which allows us to exchange certificate funds that would not be fdic insured with other banks through a central exchange vendor 
to offset the slow deposit growth and fund the loan growth  we used federal home loan bank borrowings at rates lower than certificates of deposit rates 
this resulted in an increase in average borrowings of million  or during in addition to borrowings  we utilized cash flow from securities to help fund the loan growth 
the increased cost of deposits and borrowings seen in the yield rate column in the table above  more than offset the increase from rates in the earning assets 
while the yield on earning assets increased basis points to  the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased basis points to 
we had a net interest margin of in  a basis point decrease from for helping to offset the higher cost of funding was a increase in demand deposits 
the year will likely be a challenging year in margin management 
while the federal reserve debates raising or lowering interest rates  banks are dealing with an inverted yield curve with deposits repricing at higher rates while loans re price at rates lower than the bank would like due to the competition for new loans 
until the inverted yield curve reverses  banks earnings at the margin are likely to be lower than desired 
the timing of a change in rates in conjunction with the repricing of deposits could have a damaging impact on earnings 
however should the inverted yield curve reverse or rates decrease and lower the cost of deposits  we could benefit from the large amount of certificates of deposit maturing in the second half of in  average earning asset growth of resulted from an increase in average loans outstanding of  a decrease in federal funds sold of and a slight decrease in average securities 
growth in average earning assets of million was primarily funded by average deposit growth of million and an increase in average borrowings of million 
in  net interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased to million from million in average earning asset growth of was the primary factor in the increase in net interest income and in producing a net interest margin of  an basis point decrease from in the volume and rate analysis table that follows reflects changes in interest income and interest expense resulting from changes in average volume and average rates

interest sensitivity our primary goals in interest rate risk management are to minimize negative fluctuations in net interest margin as a percentage of earning assets and to increase the dollar amount of net interest income at a growth rate consistent with the growth rate of total assets 
these goals are accomplished by managing the interest sensitivity gap  which is the difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities in a specific time interval 
interest sensitivity gap is managed by balancing the volume of floating rate liabilities with a similar volume of floating rate assets  by keeping the average maturity of fixed rate asset and liability contracts reasonably consistent and short  and by routinely adjusting pricing to market conditions on a regular basis 
we generally strive to maintain a position flexible enough to move to equality between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities  which may be desirable when there are wide and frequent fluctuations in interest rates 
matching the amount of assets and liabilities maturing in the same time interval helps to hedge interest rate risk and to minimize the impact on net interest income in periods of rising or falling interest rates 
interest rate gaps are managed through investments  loan pricing and deposit pricing 
when an unacceptable positive gap within a one year time frame occurs maturities can be extended by selling shorter term investments and purchasing longer maturities 
when an unacceptable negative gap occurs  variable rate loans can be increased and more investment in shorter term investments can be made 
the banking industry traditionally faces funding challenges in an environment such as that currently in place when the yield curve is flat or inverted 
managing the interest rate gap has become much more challenging in the rising rate environment where many depositors have chosen to move funds out of savings and money market accounts and into higher rate  longer maturity certificates of deposit or the securities market 
while this customer change in deposit preference unfavorably impacts the current interest margin  it creates an asset sensitive 
table of contents balance sheet in the short term  as more assets are subject to short term interest rate increases than the amount of liabilities subject to the same short term increases 
in a day horizon the company is asset sensitive  but we are slightly liability sensitive in a one year time frame 
noninterest income noninterest income increased by thousand or to million in compared to million in service charges on deposit accounts  the largest source of noninterest income  increased by thousand or from million in to million in other operating income increased thousand or from million in to million in service charges benefited from increased fees based on both rate and volume increases 
other operating income included increases of thousand in debit and credit card activity fees  thousand in investment services income  thousand in evb mortgage  inc income  thousand in bank owned life insurance income  thousand in title company income and thousand in wire transfer fees 
realized gain on sale of securities decreased thousand to thousand from thousand in the prior year 
we had no gains or losses from other real estate  reflecting good asset quality 
noninterest income increased thousand or from to  attributable to a thousand increase in service charges on deposits  a thousand increase in other operating income  a thousand increase in gain on sale of other real estate and a thousand decrease in realized gain on sale of securities

this reflects a fulltime equivalent staff count that did not change during the year 
on a year to year basis  the increase in salaries and benefits  to million in compared to million in  compares to a increase in the prior year 
net occupancy and equipment expense increased thousand or to million for  from million in with no major initiatives for most of the year  increases in it service contracts  it repairs  software maintenance and rent expense were mostly offset by decreases in depreciation and equipment service contracts 
in early december  we relocated the airpark branch that was in a strip mall shopping center to a stand alone office owned by the bank 
depreciation and other higher expenses for this new office will increase expenses in  but should be offset by increased earnings from an already profitable office 
other operating expenses increased thousand or to million in from million in this increase was influenced by decreases in consulting fees of thousand and data processing of thousand  offset by increases in marketing and advertising expense of thousand and other operating expense of thousand 
the consulting expense decline was the result of completing the one bank reorganization project in april and moving into a normal business mode from the standards of 
table of contents excellence project mode of the prior three years 
the data processing change was the result of better segmenting expenses in our chart of accounts 
where many expenses had been paid from the data processing account in the past  new accounts were set up in to isolate some equipment and software maintenance expenses 
these expenses were placed in the occupancy and equipment category and the net impact between the two categories was an increase of thousand 
marketing and advertising expense was up due to expenses on major awareness efforts in the various communities that we serve that we were merging our predecessor banks and re branding as evb 
in addition  the introduction of a new product  reward checking  required a heavy advertising campaign 
other expenses increased as a result of higher security expenses from upgrading the security system throughout our company  atm charge offs as a result of compromised card numbers obtained from merchant data files  miscellaneous lending expenses as a result of loan volume  heloc costs and increased collection expense and higher internet banking expenses 
we expect increases in these expenses in the future to mirror our growth efforts 
in  total noninterest expense increased million or compared to an increase of million or during in total dollars  noninterest expense was million in compared to million in salaries and benefits accounted for million  or  of the increase 
on a year to year basis  salaries and benefits increased to million in compared to million in the increase in salaries and benefits was the result of additions to staff related to the opening of the new central garage office in late fourth quarter and the opening of the glenns office in june these two locations added thousand to personnel expense 
other personnel expenses included a thousand or increase in pension expense resulting from actuarial estimates related to market performance  the discount rate used and the prior year staff increases pension expense growth slowed in and is expected to remain flat in  a thousand or increase in payroll taxes and employee health insurance  and normal increases in salaries and other benefits 
the total number of full time equivalent officers and staff increased by or to at year end  compared to at year end the increase was the result of staff for the new branch opened in june and minimal increases in customer contact areas 
net occupancy and equipment expense increased thousand or to million for  from million in the central garage office and the glenns office contributed thousand to this increase in net occupancy and equipment expense 
other building and equipment expenses have increased as a result of branch expansion over the last two years and the increases brought on by rising energy prices 
the following expenses increased utilities by thousand  building repairs and maintenance by thousand  rent by thousand  and equipment service contracts by thousand 
other operating expenses in increased thousand or to million from million in primary contributors to this expense growth were increases in data processing of thousand  consultant fees of thousand  director fees of thousand  and audit and accounting fees of thousand 
data processing fees increased due to expansion of capacity and other upgrades 
consulting expense grew due to our incurring the last of the standards of excellence  phase ii program expense in the first half of the year and incurring some of the one bank consolidation expense in the last quarter of the year

the basis point increase in effective tax rate was primarily due to higher taxable income as our statutory marginal tax rate increased from to and a continued decrease in tax exempt income

consumer loans are the fifth largest component of our loan portfolio in comprising of the portfolio at year end compared to at year end and and at year end and  respectively 
this portfolio component consists primarily of installment loans 
net consumer loans for household  family and other personal expenditures totaled million at year end  down million from million at year end 
lifestyle changes with emphasis on fast and easy one step loans have created intense competition for consumer borrowing dollars 
this change combined with the automotive industry s various rebate programs with low rates at the dealer location continue a trend that started in of decreasing consumer loans both in absolute amount and percentage of the total loan portfolio 
commercial and agricultural loans are designed specifically to meet the needs of small and medium size business customers 
this category of loans increased in total dollars outstanding to million at 
table of contents december  compared to at december  however  due to the growth of real estate construction loans  it comprised only of the total portfolio at year end compared to at year end and at year end we have made a clear commitment to support small to medium sized business growth as can be seen by the growth in real estate construction and commercial  industrial and agricultural loans 
consistent with our focus on providing community based financial services  we generally do not make loans outside of our principal market region 
we do not engage in foreign lending activities  consequently the loan portfolio is not exposed to the sometimes volatile risk from foreign credits 
we further maintain a policy not to originate or purchase loans classified by regulators as highly leveraged transactions or loans to foreign entities or individuals 
our unfunded loan commitments  excluding credit card lines and letters of credit  at year end totaled million  the same as year end unfunded loan commitments excluding million in home equity lines are used in large part to meet seasonal funding needs which are generally higher from spring through fall than at year end 
historically  our loan collateral has been primarily real estate because of the nature of our market region 
asset quality our allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the amount needed to provide for inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
in determining adequacy of the allowance  we consider our historical loss experience  the size and composition of the loan portfolio  specific impaired loans  the overall level of nonaccrual loans  the value and adequacy of collateral and guarantors  experience and depth of lending staff  effects of credit concentrations and economic conditions 
the allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses  which is charged to expense and reduced by charge offs  net of recoveries 
because the risk of loan loss includes general economic trends as well as conditions affecting individual borrowers  the allowance for loan losses can only be an estimate 
our ratio of nonperforming assets at year end was almost flat at compared to at december  and down from at december  this measure emphasizes our continued vigilance of our loan portfolio 
actual nonperforming assets increased to million at year end  compared to million at year end net charge offs for decreased thousand or to thousand  compared to thousand for the year 
we have a loan review function consisting of bank officers and board members 
additionally an independent credit review firm performs a review of loans  including a sfas no 
review for determining specific reserves 
we utilize a risk based evaluation system based on loan type  collateral and payment history to determine the amount of the allowance for loan losses 
management believes the allowance for loan losses to be adequate based on this loan review process and analysis 
improved asset quality in allowed us to lower our loan loss allowance ratio to at year end  compared to at december  and at year end  respectively 
for the same dates  the loan loss allowance to nonaccrual loans ratio was  and  indicating that the allowance was adequate with respect to nonaccrual loans 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is subject to regulatory examinations which may review such factors as the method used to calculate the allowance and the size of the allowance in comparison to peer companies identified by regulatory agencies

this increase only raised the ratio of nonperforming assets to total loans and other real estate at year end to compared to at year end 
table of contents nonperforming loans at year end consisted of million of loans secured by real estate in our market area  thousand of commercial and agricultural loans and thousand of consumer loans 
based on estimated fair values of the related collateral  we consider the nonperforming real estate loans recoverable  with any individual deficiency well covered by the allowance for loan losses 
the total amount of unsecured nonaccrual loans was thousand 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status at the time when the collection of principal and interest are considered to be doubtful 
no interest is accrued on loans placed in a nonaccrual status  and any unpaid interest previously accrued on such loans is reversed when a loan is placed in nonaccrual status 
if interest on nonaccrual loans had been accrued  such income would have approximated thousand and thousand for the years and  respectively

although trends for credit quality factors continue to be stable  it is likely that evb will continue provisions for loan losses in at a slightly higher level 
the primary factors for additional provision are growth in the loan portfolio and the possibility of an economic downturn later in as noted in many economic forecasts 
at december   we reported million in impaired loans of which million were included in nonperforming loans 
loans are viewed as impaired based upon individual evaluations of discounted expected cash flows or collateral valuations 
these loans are subject to constant management attention  and their status is reviewed on a regular basis 
securities securities available for sale include those securities that may be sold in response to changes in market interest rates  changes in the security s prepayment risk  increases in loan demand  general liquidity needs  and other similar factors  and are carried at estimated fair market value

the effect of valuing the available for sale portfolio at market  net of income taxes  is reflected as a line in the shareholders equity section of the balance sheet as accumulated other comprehensive income of negative million at december  and a negative million at year end 
we follow a policy of not engaging in activities considered to be derivative in nature such as options  futures  swaps or forward commitments

see note to the consolidated financial statements 
deposits we have historically focused on increasing core deposits to reduce the need for other borrowings to fund growth in earning assets 
core deposits provide a low cost and stable source of funding for our asset growth 
interest rates paid on deposits are carefully managed to provide an attractive market rate while at the same time not adversely affecting the net interest margin 
borrowing through the federal home loan bank of atlanta is utilized for funding when the cost of borrowed funds falls below the cost of new interest bearing deposits 
our million  or  deposit growth in was less than our loan growth and required us to spend more for deposits and to borrow from the fhlb to fund loan growth 
this continues a trend noted in and and is related to the inverted yield curve that has existed over the same time period 
total deposits at december  of million were an increase from million at year end 
noninterest bearing deposits decreased slightly by thousand or to million at year end compared to million at december  during the same period  interest bearing deposits increased to million at year end  compared to million at december

table of contents capital resources capital resources are managed to maintain a capital structure that provides us the ability to support asset growth  absorb potential losses and expand our franchise when appropriate 
capital represents original investment by shareholders plus retained earnings and provides financial resources over which we can exercise greater control as compared to deposits and borrowed funds 
regulatory authorities have adopted guidelines to establish minimum capital standards 
specifically  the guidelines classify assets and balance sheet items into four risk weighted categories 
the minimum regulatory total capital to risk weighted assets is  of which at least must be tier capital  defined as common equity and retained earnings  plus trust preferred debt up to of tier capital  less goodwill and intangibles 
at december   we had a total capital ratio of and a tier ratio of  both far in excess of regulatory guidelines and the amount needed to support our banking business 
capital is carefully managed as the financial opportunities of a high capital base are weighed against the impact of the return on equity ratio 
in january  we announced a stock repurchase program intended to reduce high capital levels and to increase return on equity to shareholders 
we repurchased no shares in or and  shares in in december  we completed an offering of our common stock 
we sold million shares and received over million net proceeds in new capital 
the purpose of the offering was to bolster our capital position and position us for continued growth 

table of contents the following table provides an analysis of our capital as of december    and note in the consolidated financial statements presents an analysis of the capital position of both our company and evb as of year end  and analysis of capital at december  dollars in thousands tier capital common stock surplus retained earnings total equity trust preferred debt less goodwill and intangibles total tier capital tier capital allowance for loan losses total risk based capital risk weighted assets capital ratios tier risk based capital total risk based capital tier capital to average total assets off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had million of off balance sheet credit exposure in the form of million of commitments to grant loans and unfunded commitments under lines of credit and million of standby letters of credit 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
the commitments for equity lines of credit may expire without being drawn upon 
therefore  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the amount of collateral obtained  if it is deemed necessary by us  is based on our credit evaluation of the customer 
unfunded commitments under commercial lines of credit  revolving credit lines and overdraft protection agreements are commitments for possible future extensions of credit to existing customers 
these lines of credit are usually uncollateralized and do not always contain a specified maturity date and may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which we are committed 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
we generally hold collateral supporting those commitments if deemed necessary 
liquidity liquidity represents an institution s ability to meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through liability management 
liquid assets include cash  deposits with other banks  federal funds sold  investments and loans maturing or repricing within one year 
our management of liquid assets provides a liquidity level that we believe is sufficient to satisfy our depositors requirements and to meet our customers credit needs 
at december   million or of total earning assets were due to mature or reprice within the next year 

table of contents we also maintain additional sources of liquidity through a variety of borrowing arrangements 
federal funds borrowing arrangements with major regional banks combined with immediately available lines of credit with the federal home loan bank totaled million at december  at year end  we had million of fhlb borrowings outstanding 
during  we executed a net of million in new fhlb borrowings and paid down principal of on preexisting fhlb borrowings 
the following table presents our contractual obligations and scheduled payment amounts due at various intervals over the next five years and beyond 
as of payments due by period total less than year years years over years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total composed of fhlb advances and trust prefered debt inflation in financial institutions  unlike most manufacturing companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a bank s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rate movement is not necessarily tied to movements in the same direction or with the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services  since such prices are affected by inflation to a larger extent than interest rates 
accounting rule changes refer to note of the audited financial statements for recent accounting pronouncements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates and equity prices 
our market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk 
we are responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position of evb and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk 
the board of directors reviews guidelines established by management 
it is our policy not to engage in activities considered to be derivative in nature such as futures  option contracts  swaps  caps  floors  collars or forward commitments 
we consider derivatives as speculative which is contrary to our historical or prospective philosophy 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
we do hold in our loan and securities portfolios investments that adjust or float according to changes in index rates which is not considered speculative  but necessary for good asset liability management 
asset liability risk management the primary goals of asset liability risk management are to maximize net interest income and the net value of our future cash flows within the interest rate limits set by our asset liability committee alco 
interest rate risk measurement interest rate risk is monitored through the use of three complementary measures static gap analysis  earnings simulation modeling and net present value estimation 
while each of the interest rate risk measurements has limitations  taken together they represent a reasonably comprehensive view of the magnitude of our interest rate risk  the distribution of risk along the yield curve  the level of risk through time  and the amount of exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships 

table of contents static gap gap analysis measures the amount of repricing risk embedded in the balance sheet at a point in time 
it does so by comparing the differences in the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities 
a gap is defined as the difference between the principal amount of assets and liabilities  adjusted for off balance sheet instruments  which reprice within a specific time period 
the cumulative one year gap at year end was a negative which is within the policy limit for the one year gap of plus to minus of total earning assets at a combined company level 
core deposits and loans with noncontractual maturities are included in the gap repricing distributions based upon historical patterns determined by statistical analysis  based upon industry accepted assumptions including the most recent core deposit defaults set forth by the ffiec federal financial institutions examination council 
the gap repricing distributions include principal cash flows from residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities in the time frames in which they are expected to be received 
mortgage prepayments are estimated by applying industry median projections of prepayment speeds to portfolio segments based on coupon range and loan age 
earnings simulation the earnings simulation model forecasts one year net income under a variety of scenarios that incorporate changes in the absolute level of interest rates  changes in the shape of the yield curve and changes in interest rate relationships 
management evaluates the effects on income of alternative interest rate scenarios against earnings in a stable interest rate environment 
this type of analysis is also most useful in determining the short run earnings exposures to changes in customer behavior involving loan payments and deposit additions and withdrawals 
the most recent earnings simulation model projects net income would decrease approximately of stable rate or base net income if rates were to fall immediately by basis points 
it projects a decrease of approximately if rates rise by basis points 
management believes this reflects an asset sensitive interest risk for the one year horizon although an alternative calculation indicates an asset sensitive position in a day horizon and a slightly liability sensitive position in a one year horizon 
this dynamic simulation model includes assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to evolve through time  in different interest rate environments 
loan and deposit growth rate assumptions are derived from historical analysis and management s outlook  as are the assumptions used to project yields and rates for new loans and deposits 
all maturities  calls and prepayments in the securities portfolio are assumed to be reinvested in like instruments 
mortgage loan prepayment assumptions are developed from industry median estimates of prepayment speeds for portfolios with similar coupon ranges and seasoning 
noncontractual deposit growth rates and pricing are assumed to follow historical patterns 
the sensitivities of key assumptions are analyzed at least annually and reviewed by management 
net present value the net present value npv of the balance sheet  at a point in time  is defined as the discounted present value of asset cash flows minus the discounted value of liability cash flows 
interest rate risk analysis using npv involves changing the interest rates used in determining the cash flows and in discounting the cash flows 
the resulting percentage change in npv is an indication of the longer term repricing risk and options embedded in the balance sheet 
at year end  a basis point immediate increase in rates is estimated to decrease npv by 
additionally  npv is estimated to decrease by if rates fall immediately by basis points 
analysis of the average quarterly change in the treasury yield curve over the past ten years indicates that a parallel curve shift of basis points or more is an event that has less than a chance of occurrence 
as with gap analysis and earnings simulation modeling  assumptions about the timing and variability of balance sheet cash flows are 
table of contents critical in npv analysis 
particularly important are the assumptions driving mortgage prepayments and the assumptions about expected attrition of the core deposit portfolios 
these assumptions are applied consistently across the different rate risk measures
