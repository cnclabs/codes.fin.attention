item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general industry trends the senior living industry is experiencing growth as a result of demographic factors 
according to census data  the population in the united states over age is growing much faster than the general population 
a large number of independent and assisted living communities were built in the s 
this development activity caused an excess supply of new  high priced communities 
longer than projected fill up periods resulted in low occupancy  price discounting and financial distress for many independent and assisted living operators 
development activity was significantly reduced in the early part of this decade 
we believe that the supply and demand for these types of facilities is today nationwide about balanced 
we believe that the aging of the us population and the almost complete reliance of independent and assisted living services upon revenues from residents private pay resources should mean that these types of facilities can be profitably operated for the foreseeable future 
however  it appears to us that today some investors may be assuming that the improvements in financial results realized at these types of communities during the past few years may continue indefinitely 
the reported sales prices being paid today for some independent and assisted living communities seem to exceed replacement cost  including fill up losses 
we are concerned that new development activity may occur in the near future  and it is currently unclear whether this activity will result in excess or moderate new supply which can be absorbed without adversely affecting existing market conditions 
the increasing availability of assisted living facilities in the s caused occupancy at many nursing homes to decline 
this fact  together with restrictions on development of new nursing homes by most states  has caused nursing care to be delivered in many older facilities 
we believe that many nursing homes currently in operation are becoming physically obsolete and that eventually political pressures from an aging population will cause governmental authorities to permit increased new construction 
rehabilitation hospitals provide intensive medical services  intensive physical therapy  occupational therapy and speech language services beyond the capability customarily available in skilled nursing facilities 
we believe that if we are successful in our operation of our rehabilitation hospitals  our reputation in the rehabilitation business including providing outpatient rehabilitation services will be enhanced 
this may provide other possible opportunities for us to acquire additional irfs or to provide increasing amounts of rehabilitation services at our senior living communities 
institutional pharmacies provide large quantities of drugs at locations where patients with recurring pharmacy requirements are concentrated 
the business rationale for an institutional pharmacy is to deliver drugs and pharmacy services more efficiently and at lower costs than from expensive retail locations which cater to short term requirements 
the aging of the population and recent pharmacological innovations have created rapidly growing demand for pharmacy drugs and services 
we believe that the medicare d benefits program which became effective january  will increase the demand for pharmacy drugs and services and that cost containment pressures  which inevitably will be part of this government funded program  will increase business for efficient institutional pharmacy businesses such as those we have recently begun to operate  but that these same cost containment pressures may limit the long term profitability of this business 
we earn our revenues from residents primarily by providing housing and services to our residents 
during  approximately of our net revenues from residents at our senior living communities came from the medicare and medicaid programs and of our net revenues from residents came from private pay and other resources 
we bill all private pay residents in advance for the housing and services to be provided in the following month 
our material expenses were wages and benefits includes wages for our employees working at our senior living communities and wage related expenses such as health insurance  workers compensation insurance and other benefits 
other operating expenses includes utilities  housekeeping  dietary  maintenance  marketing  insurance and community level administrative costs at our senior living communities 
hospital expenses includes wages and benefits for our hospital based staff and other operating expenses related to our hospital business 
pharmacy expenses includes the cost of drugs dispensed to our patients as well as wages and benefits for our pharmacies and staff and other operating expenses related to our pharmacy business 
rent expense we lease of our senior living communities and two rehabilitation hospitals from senior housing and four senior living communities from hcpi 
management fee to sls fees for the senior living communities sls historically managed for us 
general and administrative expenses principally wage related costs for headquarters and regional staff supporting our communities 
depreciation and amortization expense we incur depreciation expense on buildings and furniture and equipment 
interest expense includes interest on outstanding debt balances and amortization of deferred financing costs

the increase in hospital expenses is a result of our beginning operations at our hospitals in october the increase in pharmacy expenses is a result of our acquiring one pharmacy in each of june  december  may and november management fees to sls decreased by due to our termination of management agreements in november  one agreement in february  agreements in june and seven agreements in december the rent expense increase is primarily due to the communities that we began to lease in and  the hospitals we began to lease in october and our payment of additional rent for capital improvements purchased by senior housing since january  in april  we sent notices to sls to terminate management agreements for of the senior living communities that sls then managed for us 
in june  we paid sls termination fees totaling million and terminated the sls management agreements for these communities 
in december  we terminated the last seven agreements under which sls managed senior living communities for us and paid sls termination fees totaling million 
we no longer pay management fees to sls 
the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  results from the six communities we acquired in june  the communities we acquired in the fourth quarter of  the communities we began to operate that were previously managed for us by sls and the rehabilitation hospitals we began to operate in october the increase in depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  is primarily attributable to our purchase of furniture and fixtures for our communities and in connection with our pharmacy acquisitions 
our interest and other income increased by million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   primarily as a result of a payment from healthsouth to settle numerous transition matters and claims related to our assumption of the operations of the two rehabilitation hospitals 
the amount of this settlement was approximately million 
interest and other income also increased as a result of higher levels of investable cash and increased yields on our cash and investments 
our interest expense increased by  primarily due to the issuance of our convertible notes in october because of our operating loss carryforwards  we do not anticipate owing federal tax in loss from discontinued operations for the year ended december  was million  compared to a loss of million for the year ended december  the losses in both years are primarily due to operating expenses we incurred as a result of our shutting down operations at two communities in and year ended december  versus year ended december  the following tables present an overview of our portfolio for the years ended december  and for the years ended december  variance change dollars in thousands  except per day amounts net revenues from residents pharmacy revenue wages and benefits other operating expenses pharmacy expenses management fee to sls termination expense for sls management agreements rent expense general and administrative depreciation and amortization impairment of assets interest and other income interest expense provision for income taxes loss from discontinued operations net loss income no

the increase in net revenues from residents at the communities that we operated continuously since january  is due primarily to higher per diem charges to residents 
the increase in revenues from our pharmacies is a result of our acquiring one pharmacy in september and another pharmacy in june our increase in wages and benefits costs is primarily due to wages and benefits at the communities we acquired in november  the six communities we acquired in june and wage increases 
the increase in other operating expenses  which include utilities  housekeeping  dietary  maintenance  insurance and community level administrative costs  primarily results from the other operating expenses at the communities we acquired in november  the six communities we acquired in june and increased charges from third parties 
the community expenses for the communities that we have operated continuously since january  increased by principally due to wage and benefit increases 
the increase in pharmacy expenses is a result of our acquiring one pharmacy in september and another pharmacy in june management fees related to the communities that sls managed for us increased by because of increased revenues at these communities and a contractual increase in the formula for calculating the management fee 
the rent expense increase is due to additional communities that we began to lease in and  and our payment of additional rent for capital improvements purchased by senior housing since january  the termination expense for sls management agreements arose from our termination of management agreements for of the senior living communities that sls then managed for us 
in august  we notified sls of the termination of management agreements for senior living communities  and  in november  we terminated these sls management agreements for a payment of million 
in february  we terminated the management agreement for one additional community for a payment of million  but because we sent a binding termination notice to sls for this community in december  we accrued this termination fee in the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  primarily results from our increased operations at the communities we acquired in november  the six communities we acquired in june  integration costs associated with our acquisition of those communities and increased audit and professional services fees for compliance with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of the increase in depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  is primarily attributable to the communities we acquired in november  the six communities we acquired in june and our purchase of furniture and fixtures for our communities then managed by sls 
to partially fund our termination fees for the management agreements with sls on november   we sold the six communities that we acquired in june to senior housing for net proceeds of million  and senior housing leased these communities back to us 
in connection with the sale of these communities to senior housing  we recognized a million impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of these communities to the amount realized upon their sale to senior housing 
the purchase price paid to us by senior housing is the same amount as the purchase price we paid to the seller of the communities 
the impairment loss which we recognized in relates principally to transaction costs which we previously capitalized 
our interest and other income decreased by primarily because of lower levels of investable cash 
our interest expense increased by million  or  primarily due to the mortgages we assumed in connection with certain acquisitions 
the provision for income taxes decreased because we do not anticipate owing tax under the alternative minimum tax regime in we accrued  of federal alternative minimum income tax expense during the year ended december  loss from discontinued operations for the year ended december  was million  compared to a loss of million for the year ended december  the losses in both years are primarily the result of our ceasing operations at two communities in and three communities in liquidity and capital resources we believe that a combination of our cash on hand  our efforts to increase revenues and contain costs  our ability to borrow on our revolving credit facility  our ability to sell to senior housing certain capital improvements made to communities that we lease from senior housing and the possibility of sales or financings of our owned communities will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs  operating expenses  rent payments to senior housing  debt service and capital expenditures for the next months and the foreseeable future 
assets and liabilities our current assets at december  were million  compared to million at december  at december  and  we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively 
this increase in cash and cash equivalents is primarily the result of the issuance of our convertible notes in october our current liabilities were million at december   compared to million at december  the increase in current liabilities is primarily the result of our electing to prepay seven mortgages in accordance with the terms of the related indebtedness 
we expect to complete these prepayments totaling approximately million by march  our leases with senior housing as of march   we lease senior living communities and two rehabilitation hospitals from senior housing under six leases 
our leases with senior housing require us to pay minimum rent of million annually and percentage rent for most communities 
the terms of our leases with senior housing contain provisions whereby senior housing may cancel our rights under these agreements upon the acquisition by any person or group of more than of our voting stock and upon other change of control events 
these leases also limit our ability to create  incur  assume or guarantee indebtedness 
as of march   we believe we are in compliance with the terms of our leases with senior housing 
upon our request  senior housing reimburses our capital expenditures made at the communities we lease from senior housing and increases our rent pursuant to contractual formulas 
senior housing reimbursed us million during the year ended december  for capital expenditures made at these leased communities and increased our annual rent by approximately million 
in february  we assumed the operations of a community from sls which is located in coral springs  florida 
we began a significant capital improvement project at this community in that will continue into and the cost of this project may total approximately million 
pursuant to the terms of our lease with senior housing  senior housing will fund the cost of this capital improvement project and our annual rent payable to senior housing will increase pursuant to the formula set forth in the lease 
our revenues our revenues from services to residents at our communities are our primary source of cash to fund our operating expenses  including rent  principal and interest payments on our debt and our capital expenditures 
at some of our communities  operating revenues for nursing home services are received from the medicare and medicaid programs 
medicare and medicaid revenues from residents were earned primarily at our nursing homes 
we derived and of our net revenues from residents from these programs for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our medicare net revenues from senior living community residents totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in each of october and  our medicare rates increased by approximately over the prior period 
our change in medicare revenues from to resulted from a slight decrease in the number of residents at our facilities who were eligible for medicare 
effective january   cms implemented changes to the payment categories it uses to set daily payment rates for medicare beneficiaries in skilled nursing facilities 
these categories are known as resource utilization groups  or rugs 
cms has introduced nine new payment categories for medically complex patients  increasing the number of categories from to  and has made revisions to its payment rates for current rugs 
also effective january   these rug changes eliminated certain temporary additional payments for certain skilled nursing care and rehabilitation groups 
these changes to medicare reimbursement rates effectively eliminated the benefit of the october medicare rate increases 
our medicaid net revenues from senior living community residents totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the bush administration and certain members of the senate and the house of representatives have recently proposed medicare and medicaid policy changes and rate reductions to be phased in during the next several years 
in addition  some of the states in which we operate either have not raised medicaid rates by amounts sufficient to offset increasing costs or are expected to reduce medicaid funding 
the magnitude of the potential medicare and medicaid rate reductions and the impact of the failure of these programs to increase rates to match increasing expenses  as well as the magnitude of the potential medicare and medicaid policy changes  cannot currently be estimated  but they may be material to our operations  may affect our future results of operations and may produce losses 
we began to operate two rehabilitation hospitals in october approximately of our revenues from these hospitals came from the medicare and medicaid programs 
in may  cms issued a rule establishing revised medicare standards that rehabilitation hospitals are required to meet in order to participate as irfs in the medicare program  known as the rule 
the rule is being phased in over a four year period that began on july  for cost reporting periods starting on and after july   of a facility s inpatient population must require intensive rehabilitation services for one of cms designated medical conditions 
for cost reporting periods starting on and after july   the requirement is and for cost reporting periods starting on and after july   the requirement is 
an irf that fails to meet the requirements of the rule is subject to reclassification as a different type of healthcare provider  and the effect of such reclassification would be to lower medicare payment rates 
under the mpdima  medicare beneficiaries may receive prescription drug benefits effective january  by enrolling in private health plans or managed care organizations  or if they remain in a traditional medicare program  by enrolling in stand alone prescription drug plans 
as a result  our pharmacy operations became more dependent upon the medicare program 
insurance recent increases in the costs of insurance  especially tort liability insurance  workers compensation and employee health insurance  may continue to have an adverse impact upon our future results of operations 
although we self insure a large portion of these costs  our costs have increased as a result of the higher costs that we incur to settle claims 
acquisitions and related financings in march  we acquired a unit assisted living community located in georgia for approximately million 
we financed the acquisition with cash on hand 
in june  we acquired six assisted living communities for approximately million  these communities had a combined licensed resident capacity of and are located in western pennsylvania 
we funded this purchase using million drawn under our revolving credit facility  the proceeds of a sale leaseback transaction and a mortgage transaction with senior housing 
in connection with these transactions  we sold four assisted living communities to senior housing for million and senior housing leased these communities back to us for initial rent of million per year 
senior housing also provided us with a million first mortgage line of credit secured by the six purchased communities 
we borrowed million under the first mortgage line of credit when we closed this purchase and repaid it in august with proceeds raised from our sale of common shares 
in october  we sold six communities to senior housing for net proceeds of million and senior housing leased these communities back to us 
our initial rent to senior housing for these communities was million per annum 
the purchase price paid to us by senior housing is the same amount as the purchase price we paid to acquire the communities 
in connection with the sale and leaseback of the six communities  we terminated the first mortgage line of credit with senior housing which had been secured by these facilities 
between september and december  we agreed to lease senior living communities with  units which senior housing acquired from third parties 
six of these communities are assisted living communities three of which offer some skilled nursing services  three are independent living communities and two are continuing care retirement communities which offer independent living  assisted living and skilled nursing services 
our rent payable to senior housing for these communities is million per year  plus future increases calculated as a percentage of the revenue increases at these communities after we added these communities to our existing lease with senior housing which has a current term ending in  plus renewal options thereafter 
residents pay substantially all of our charges at these communities from their private resources 
between june and november  we acquired four institutional pharmacy businesses located in omaha  nebraska  west hills  california  myrtle beach  south carolina and vienna  virginia for approximately million   million and million  respectively 
rehabilitation hospitals in october  we began to lease two rehabilitation hospitals from senior housing 
the term of the lease for these two hospitals expires on june   subject to our right to extend the term of the lease for an additional years 
these two hospitals provide health rehabilitation services and are located in braintree and woburn  massachusetts 
our rent payable to senior housing for these hospitals is million per year 
these hospitals offer extensive inpatient and outpatient services that we believe are similar to services we provide  or may provide  in many of our senior living communities 
discontinued operations during  we ceased operations at one assisted living community in los angeles  california and one skilled nursing facility in milwaukee  wisconsin 
we leased this community and this facility from senior housing 
senior housing sold the assisted living community located in california in december for net proceeds of approximately million  which caused a  reduction in the annual minimum rent we pay to senior housing in accordance with our lease terms 
senior housing sold the skilled nursing facility located in wisconsin in december for net proceeds of approximately million  which caused a  reduction in the annual minimum rent we pay to senior housing in accordance with our lease terms 
in june  we ceased operations at two skilled nursing facilities located in connecticut that we leased from senior housing 
senior housing sold those facilities in november for net proceeds of approximately million  which caused a  reduction in the annual minimum rent we pay to senior housing in accordance with our lease terms 
termination of sls management agreements in november  we terminated management agreements for of the senior living communities that sls then managed for us  paid sls termination fees totaling million and began to directly operate these communities 
we funded this termination payment with cash on hand  including the proceeds from our august and september common share offering  and with the proceeds of a sale leaseback transaction with senior housing for the six communities we acquired in june in february  we terminated a management agreement for one senior living community that sls then managed for us  paid sls a termination fee of million and began to directly operate this community

we used a portion of the proceeds raised in this offering to pay off the million first mortgage line of credit with senior housing described above and to reduce amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility  and we added the remainder to available cash balances 
in april  we issued  common shares in an underwritten public offering raising net proceeds of million 
we used a portion of the proceeds raised in this offering to pay the million in termination fees for the sls management agreements we terminated in june  and we added the remainder to available cash balances 
in october  we issued in a private placement million principal amount of our convertible notes 
we used the proceeds raised in this private placement to pay the termination fees for the remaining management agreements with sls  and we added the remainder to available cash balances 
contractual obligations table as of december   our contractual obligations were as follows dollars in thousands payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years debt obligations operating lease obligations other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet total debt obligations are the amounts due under several hud insured mortgages as well as our outstanding convertible notes 
debt obligations due in less than one year include the entire balances for the seven mortgages that we expect to prepay by march  operating lease obligations are the minimum lease payments to senior housing and hcpi through the current lease terms ending between and these amounts do not include percentage rent that may become payable under these leases 
other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet are primarily insurance reserves related to workers compensation and professional liability insurance 
debt instruments and covenants the interest rate on borrowings under our revolving credit facility is libor plus a premium 
the maximum amount available under this facility is million  and is subject to limitations based upon qualifying collateral

in july  we entered into an amendment to the facility to lower the interest paid on drawings under the facility and to extend the termination date to may  the termination date may be further extended twice  in each case by twelve months  subject to lender approval  our payment of extension fees and other conditions 
as of december  and march   no amounts were outstanding under this credit facility 
as of december  and march   we believe we are in compliance with all applicable covenants under this revolving credit facility 
at december   we had hud insured mortgage loans totaling million that were secured by nine of our communities 
by march   we expect to have prepaid seven mortgages that were secured by six of our communities 
we expect to pay approximately million to payoff these seven mortgages  which will consist of approximately million in principal and approximately  in prepayment penalties 
because we had carried these mortgages at a premium to their fair value  we will recognize a gain of approximately million in connection with the early extinguishment of debt 
the weighted average interest rate on these mortgages was 
the weighted average interest rate on the remaining four mortgages is 
payments of principal and interest are due monthly on our remaining four mortgages until maturities at varying dates ranging from february to june these mortgages contain standard hud mortgage covenants 
as of december  and march   we believe we are in compliance with all covenants of these four mortgages 
in october  we issued in a private placement million principal amount of convertible notes  which included million principal amount of the notes issued pursuant to the underwriters exercise of an over allotment option 
our net proceeds from this private placement were approximately million 
these notes are convertible into our common shares at any time 
the initial conversion rate  which is subject to possible adjustment  is common shares per  principal amount of notes  which represents an initial conversion price of per share 
a holder that surrenders notes for conversion in connection with a make whole fundamental change  as defined in the indenture governing the notes  that occurs before october  may in some circumstances be entitled to an increased conversion rate ie  a lower per share conversion price 
the convertible notes bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable semi annually in arrears on april and october of each year  starting on april  the notes mature on october  on or after october   we may redeem the notes  in whole or in part  at a redemption price in cash equal to of the principal amount of the notes we redeem  plus any accrued and unpaid interest

the notes are guaranteed by certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
our subsidiary guarantors may be released from their obligations under certain circumstances 
as of december  and march   we believe we are in compliance with all covenants of the indenture pursuant to which these notes were issued 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements  commercial paper  derivatives  swaps  hedges  third party guarantees  or material joint ventures or partnerships 
related person transactions we were a owned subsidiary of senior housing before december  on december   senior housing distributed substantially all of our then outstanding shares to its shareholders 
in order to effect this spin off and to govern relations after the spin off  we entered into agreements with senior housing and others pursuant to which it was agreed  among other things  that so long as senior housing remains a real estate investment trust  or a reit  we may not waive the share ownership restrictions in our charter on the ability of any person or group to acquire more than of any class of our equity shares without the consent of senior housing  so long as we are a tenant of senior housing  we will not permit nor take any action that  in the reasonable judgment of senior housing or hrpt properties trust another reit  or hrpt  might jeopardize the tax status of senior housing or hrpt as reits  senior housing has the option  upon the acquisition by a person or group of more than of our voting stock and upon other change in control events  as defined  to cancel all of our rights under the leases we have with senior housing  and so long as we maintain our shared services agreement with rmr we will not acquire or finance any real estate without first giving senior housing  hrpt or any other publicly owned reit or other entity managed by rmr  the opportunity to acquire or finance real estate investments of the type in which senior housing  hrpt or any other publicly owned reit or other entity managed by rmr  respectively  invest 
at the time of our spin off from senior housing  all of the persons serving as our directors were trustees of senior housing 
our two managing directors  messrs 
martin and portnoy  are currently the managing trustees of senior housing 
of the senior living communities we operate  are leased from senior housing for total annual minimum rent of million 
since january   we have entered into several transactions with senior housing  including in october  we began to lease two rehabilitation hospitals from senior housing 
the term of the lease for these two hospitals expires on june   subject to our right to extend the term of the lease for an additional years 
these two hospitals provide health rehabilitation services and are located in braintree and woburn  massachusetts 
our rent payable to senior housing for these hospitals is million per year 
these hospitals offer extensive inpatient and outpatient services that we believe are similar to services we provide  or may provide  in many of our senior living communities 
in june  we ceased operations at two communities located in connecticut that were leased from senior housing 
in november  senior housing sold these two communities for net proceeds of approximately million  which will reduce the annual minimum rent we pay to senior housing under our lease by between september and december  we agreed to lease senior living communities with  units which senior housing acquired from third parties 
six of these communities are assisted living communities three of which offer some skilled nursing services  three are independent living communities and two are continuing care retirement communities which offer independent living  assisted living and skilled nursing services 
our rent payable to senior housing for these communities is million per year  plus future increases calculated as a percentage of the revenue increases at these communities after we added these communities to our existing lease with senior housing which has a current term ending in  plus renewal options thereafter 
residents pay substantially all of our charges at these communities from their private resources 
during  as permitted by our leases with senior housing  we sold to senior housing  at cost  approximately million of improvements made to properties leased from senior housing  and  as a result  our annual rent payable to senior housing increased by approximately million 
rmr provides certain management and administrative services to us under a shared services agreement 
rmr is compensated at an annual rate equal to of our total revenues 
aggregate fees earned by rmr for services during  and  were million  million and million  respectively 
rmr also provides the internal audit function for us and for other publicly owned companies to which it provides management or other services 
our pro rata share of rmr s costs in providing that function for the years ended  and was   and  respectively 
our audit committee appoints our director of internal audit  and our compensation committee approves his salary 
our compensation committee also approves the costs we pay with respect to our internal audit function 
the fact that rmr has responsibilities to other entities  including our most significant landlord  senior housing  could create conflicts  and in the event of such conflicts between senior housing and us  the shared services agreement allows rmr to act on behalf of senior housing rather than on our behalf 
rmr is beneficially owned by messrs 
barry m 
portnoy  one of our managing directors  and his son  adam d 
portnoy  president and chief executive officer and a director of rmr  a managing trustee of hrpt and hospitality properties trust another reit and a nominee for election as a managing trustee of senior housing 
all transactions between us and rmr are approved by our compensation committee 
our chief executive officer and chief financial officer are also officers and employees of rmr 
these officers devote a substantial majority of their business time to our affairs and the remainder to rmr s business which is separate from our business 
we believe the compensation we pay to these officers reasonably reflects their division of business time  however  periodically  these individuals may divide their business time differently than they do currently and their compensation from us may become disproportionate to this division 
a subsidiary of rmr is the owner of the building in which our headquarters is located 
this lease expires in we paid rent  which includes our proportional share of utilities and real estate taxes  under this lease during  and of   and  respectively 
this lease has been amended at various times to take into account our needs for increasing space 
in december  we commenced leasing space for a regional office in atlanta  georgia from hrpt 
this lease expires in we paid rent  which includes our proportional share of utilities and real estate taxes  under this lease during of  we believe that all our transactions with related parties are on reasonable commercial terms  and all such transactions between us and related parties are approved by our independent directors 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies concern revenue recognition  our assessment of the net realizable value of our accounts receivable  the realizable value of long term assets  accounting for long term care contracts  accounting for business combinations and our assessment of reserves related to our self insurance programs 
our revenue recognition policies involve judgments about medicare and medicaid rate calculations 
these judgments are based principally upon our experience with these programs and our knowledge and familiarity with the current rules and regulations of these programs 
we recognize revenues when services are provided and these amounts are reported at their estimated net realizable amounts 
some medicare and medicaid revenues are subject to audit and retroactive adjustment  and sometimes retroactive legislative changes 
our policies for valuing accounts receivable involve significant judgments based upon our experience  including consideration of the age of the receivables  the terms of the agreements with our residents  their third party payors or other obligors  the residents or payors stated intent to pay  the residents or payors financial capacity and other factors which may include litigation or appeal proceedings 
we regularly evaluate whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that could indicate impairment in the value of long lived assets 
if there is an indication that the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable  we estimate the projected undiscounted cash flows from the asset to determine if an impairment loss should be recognized 
we determine the amount of impairment loss by comparing the historical carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value 
we determine estimated fair value through an evaluation of recent financial performance  recent sales of similar assets  market conditions and projected discounted cash flows of properties using standard industry valuation techniques 
this process requires that estimates be made and errors in our judgments or estimates could have a material effect on our financial statements 
at one of our communities  we offer continuing care contracts under which residents may pay admission fees in exchange for reduced charges during their occupancy 
these fees may be refundable or non refundable  or partially refundable and partially non refundable 
we record these fees as obligations and amortize the non refundable amounts into revenue over the actuarially determined remaining lives of the individual residents which are the expected periods of occupancy 
actuarially determined remaining lives are estimates based upon general demographic samplings and averages 
our decision to amortize the non refundable fees over actuarially determined lives is based upon our estimates that these residents will remain at our facilities for that period 
the actual remaining lives and the actual period of occupancy of the individual residents who pay the non refundable fees may differ materially from these estimates 
in the future  if we find that such differences are material  we may change the actuarial tables which we use and we may change our estimates that these residents will remain at our facilities for these periods  and these changes could have a material impact upon our financial statements 
each of our acquisitions has been accounted for as a purchase business combination in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
purchase accounting requires that we make certain judgments and estimates based on our experience  including determining the fair value and useful lives of assets acquired and the fair value of liabilities assumed 
some of our judgments and estimates are also based upon published industry statistics and in some cases third party appraisals 
determining reserves for the self insurance portions of our insurance programs involves significant judgments based upon our experience  including projected settlements for pending claims  known incidents which we expect may result in claims  estimates of incurred but not yet reported claims  claims experience  estimated litigation costs and other factors 
we also periodically receive and rely upon recommendations from professional consultants in establishing these reserves  however  these reserves may prove to be materially inaccurate 
in the future we may need to revise the judgments  estimates and assessments we use to formulate our critical accounting policies to incorporate information which is not now known 
we cannot predict the effect changes to these premises underlying our critical accounting policies may have on our future results of operations  although such changes could be material and adverse 
inflation and deflation inflation in the past several years in the us has been modest 
future inflation might have either positive or negative impacts on our business 
rising price levels may allow us to increase occupancy charges to residents  but may also cause our operating costs  including our percentage rent  to increase 
also  our ability to affect rate increases paid by the medicare and medicaid programs will be limited despite inflation 
deflation would likely have a negative impact upon us 
a large component of our expenses consists of our minimum rental obligations to senior housing and hcpi 
accordingly we believe that a general decline in price levels which could cause our charges to residents to decline would likely not be fully offset by a decline in our expenses 
seasonality our senior living business is subject to modest effects of seasonality 
during the calendar fourth quarter holiday periods  nursing home and assisted living residents are sometimes discharged to join family celebrations and admission decisions are often deferred 
the first quarter of each calendar year usually coincides with increased illness among nursing home and assisted living residents which can result in increased costs or discharges to hospitals 
as a result of these factors  nursing home and assisted living operations sometimes produce greater earnings in the second and third quarters of a calendar year and lesser earnings in the first and fourth quarters 
we do not believe that this seasonality will cause fluctuations in our revenues or operating cash flow to such an extent that we will have difficulty paying our expenses  including rent  which do not fluctuate seasonally 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks associated with market changes in interest rates 
we manage our exposure to this market risk by monitoring available financing alternatives 
our strategy to manage exposure to changes in interest rates is unchanged from december  other than as described below  we do not foresee any significant changes in our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or in how we manage this exposure in the near future 
changes in market interest rates also affect the fair value of our debt obligations  increases in market interest rates decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt  while decreases in market interest rates increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt 
for example based upon discounted cash flow analysis  if prevailing interest rates were to increase by  the market value of our million mortgage debt and convertible notes outstanding on december  would decline by about million  and  similarly  if prevailing interest rates were to decline by and other credit market considerations remained unchanged  the market value of our million mortgage debt and convertible notes outstanding on december   would increase by about million 
our revolving credit facility bears interest at floating rates and matures in may as of december  and march   no amounts were outstanding under this credit facility 
we borrow in us dollars and borrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest at libor plus basis points 
accordingly  we are vulnerable to changes in us dollar based short term rates  specifically libor 
a change in interest rates would not affect the value of any outstanding floating rate debt but could affect our operating results 
for example  if the maximum amount of million were drawn under our credit facility and interest rates decreased or increased by per annum  our interest expense would decrease or increase by  per year  or per share  based on currently outstanding common shares 
if interest rates were to change gradually over time  the impact would occur over time 
our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates may increase in the future if we incur debt to fund acquisitions or otherwise
