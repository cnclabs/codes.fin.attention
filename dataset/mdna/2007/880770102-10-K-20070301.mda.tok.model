in addition to the historical information contained in this document  the discussion in this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements  made pursuant to section e of the exchange act  that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of our plans  expectations and intentions 
the cautionary statements made in this annual report on form k should be read as being applicable to all related forward looking statements whenever they appear in this annual report on form k 
our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these and any other forward looking statements 
factors that could contribute to such differences include those discussed below as well as those cautionary statements and other factors set forth in item a risk factors and elsewhere herein 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and financial condition 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
preparation of financial statements and use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to inventories  investments  goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets  bad debts  income taxes  pensions  warranties  contingencies  and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
revenue recognition in accordance with the guidance provided by the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  title and risk of loss have passed  delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
title and risk of loss generally pass to our customers upon shipment 
in circumstances where either title or risk of loss pass upon destination  acceptance or cash payment  we defer revenue recognition until such events occur 
for equipment that includes software that is incidental to the product  revenue is recognized upon shipment provided that customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment 
certain contracts require us to perform tests of the product to ensure that performance meets the published product specifications or customer requested specifications  which are generally conducted prior to shipment 
where the criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment  or in the case of new products  revenue is deferred until customer acceptance has been received 
for multiple element arrangements  we defer the greater of the fair value of any undelivered elements of the contract or the portion of the sales price which is not payable until the undelivered elements are delivered 
for a delivered item to be considered a separate unit  the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis  there must be objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items in the arrangement and the delivery or performance of the undelivered item must be considered probable and substantially in our control 
we also defer the portion of the sales price that is not due until acceptance  which represents deferred profit 
fair value is the price charged when the element is sold separately 
our post shipment obligations include installation  training services  one year standard warranties  and extended warranties 
installation does not alter the product capabilities  does not require specialized skills or tools and can be performed by the customers or other vendors 
installation is typically provided within five to fifteen days of product shipment and is completed within one to two days thereafter 
training services are optional and do not affect the customer s ability to use the product 
we defer revenue for the fair value of installation and training 
extended warranties constitute warranty obligations beyond one year and we defer revenue in accordance with fasb technical bulletin our products are generally subject to warranty and related costs of the warranty are provided for in cost of revenue when product revenue is recognized 
we classify shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue 
service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as the services are performed 
we generally do not provide our customers with contractual rights of return for any of our products 
for transactions involving the sale of software which is not incidental to the product  revenue is recognized in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
 modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions sop 
we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
in instances where an arrangement contains multiple elements  revenue is deferred related to the undelivered elements to the extent that vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe exists for such elements 
in instances where vsoe does not exist for one or more of the undelivered elements of an arrangement  all revenue related to the arrangement is deferred until all elements have been delivered 
vsoe is the price charged when the element is sold separately 
revenue for the separate elements is only recognized where the functionality of the undelivered element is not essential to the delivered element 
for certain contracts eligible for contract accounting under sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion accounting method based upon the percentage of incurred costs to estimated total costs 
these arrangements require significant production  modification or customization 
in all cases  changes to total estimated costs and anticipated losses  if any  are recognized in the period in which they are determined 
with respect to contract change orders  claims or similar items  judgment must be used in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
such amounts are only included in the contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is reasonably assured  generally upon receipt of a customer approved change order 
inventories inventories  which include materials  labor  and manufacturing overhead  are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out basis or net realizable value 
on a quarterly basis  we use consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventory for net realizable value 
we record a provision for both excess and obsolete inventory when such writedowns or write offs are identified through the quarterly review process 
the inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand  product mix and possible alternative uses 
equity incentive and stock purchase plans effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provision of sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method and therefore have not restated results for prior periods 
under this transition method  stock based compensation expense for the first quarter of fiscal includes compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   and is calculated based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
stock based compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted after january  is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provision of sfas r 
as required by sfas r  we have made an estimate of expected forfeitures and are recognizing compensation costs only for those stock based compensation awards expected to vest 
the cumulative effect of the initial adoption of sfas r was not material 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we recognized stock based compensation expense in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
apb 
in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab regarding the sec s interpretation of sfas r and the valuation of share based payments for public companies 
we have applied provisions of sab in our adoption of sfas r 
see note b accounting policies and note o stock based compensation in notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on stock based compensation 
on may   our board of directors approved the accelerated vesting of certain outstanding  unvested out of the money stock options awarded to employees  officers and other eligible participants under teradyne s various stock option plans in effect at that time 
the stock options that were accelerated had exercise prices that were in excess of  the closing price of our common stock on the new york stock exchange on may  and ranged in exercise price from to per share 
as a result of the vesting acceleration  options to purchase approximately million shares became exercisable immediately and we reduced the compensation expense we otherwise would have been required to record under sfas r by approximately million in the aggregate on a pre tax basis over fiscal years  and income taxes on a quarterly basis  we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by jurisdiction and assess the need for a valuation allowance 
as a result of its review undertaken at december   we concluded under applicable accounting criteria that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would not be realized and established a valuation allowance in several jurisdictions  most notably the united states 
due to the continued uncertainty of realization  we maintained our valuation allowance at december  and we do not expect to significantly reduce our valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists  including sustained profitability  that realization is more likely than not 
goodwill  intangible and long lived assets we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important in the determination of an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner that we use the acquired asset and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the associated risks 
we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter  on a reporting unit basis  or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired 
if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess

bookings our net orders for our three reportable segments for  and are as follows percent change percent change in millions except percent change semiconductor test systems assembly test systems other test systems the semiconductor test systems increase of in orders from to was attributed to increased demand across a wide range of markets  as customers invested in system on a chip soc test equipment  principally in the first half of the flex family of testers has moved into mainstream production and  along with the j platform  contributed to almost all of the growth experienced 
we also saw a customer shift in orders from period to period with subcontractors making up a larger percentage of orders 
the decrease in semiconductor test systems bookings from to was driven by less demand from our subcon customers  primarily in the first half of the second half of showed a increase over the first half 
although total semiconductor test systems bookings declined from to  flex bookings increased over during this period 
the assembly test systems increase of in orders from to was primarily driven by demand in the mil aero business due to the cyclical nature of the mil aero program buys 
orders in the assembly test systems segment were flat from to the decrease in other test systems orders of from to resulted from a decrease in broadband test systems  offset only slightly by an increase in diagnostic solutions 
the other test systems bookings increase from to was due primarily to a large project booked in the second half of by a major customer in our diagnostic solutions business 
our order cancellations and backlog adjustments for our three reportable segments for the last three years are as follows in millions semiconductor test systems assembly test systems other test systems semiconductor test systems experienced million of cancellations and backlog adjustments in approximately of this amount was related to cancellations  while the remainder was a backlog adjustment related to management s estimate of what may be canceled in future periods 
our net bookings by region as a percentage of total net bookings are as follows united states south east asia europe singapore japan taiwan rest of the world for the past three years  our backlog of unfilled orders for our three reportable segments is as follows in millions semiconductor test systems assembly test systems other test systems customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and without significant notice  subject to possible cancellation penalties 
in   and there were no significant cancellation penalties received 
due to possible changes in delivery schedules and cancellations of orders  our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of the actual sales for any succeeding period 
delays in delivery schedules and or cancellations of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
revenue our net revenue for our three reportable segments for  and is as follows percent change percent change in millions except percent change semiconductor test systems assembly test systems other test systems semiconductor test systems revenue increase of from to can be attributed to increased demand across a wide range of markets  as customers invested in soc test equipment 
almost the entire increase is in our flex family and j products and is distributed across all regions 
the increase is partially offset by a decrease of certain non flex test systems 
the reduction in bookings at our subcon customers in the semiconductor test systems segment in the second half of drove the decrease in revenue in the first half of the bookings reduction was primarily the result of lower utilization of our testers at our subcon customers 
the assembly test systems increase of from to in revenue was primarily driven by the in circuit commercial test systems market 
revenue in the assembly test systems segment was relatively flat from to the increase in other test systems revenue resulted from a strong increase in diagnostic solutions sales due primarily to the vehicle measurement module product line  offset by a decrease in broadband test systems sales 
other test systems revenue was relatively flat from to our three reportable segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated net revenue for each of the last three years semiconductor test systems assembly test systems other test systems our net revenue by region as a percentage of total revenue is as follows united states south east asia europe taiwan japan singapore rest of the world our product and service revenue breakout for the past three years is as follows percent change percent change in millions except percent change product revenue service revenue service revenue is derived from the servicing of our installed base of products and includes maintenance contracts  repairs  extended warranties  parts sales and applications support 
in the past three years  no single customer accounted for more than of consolidated net revenue 
in   and  our three largest customers in the aggregate accounted for  and of consolidated net revenue  respectively 
gross margin point change point change dollars in millions gross margin percent of total revenue the increase in gross margin of approximately points from to was the result of several factors 
an increase in semiconductor test systems sales volume contributed points  a shift in product mix within semiconductor test systems contributed points  an improvement in service margins  primarily within semiconductor test systems  contributed points  the remaining point increase was due to lower inventory provisions in  as we recorded a million charge for non flex products in the semiconductor test systems segment in  compared to an million charge for non flex products in the decrease in gross margin from to was the result of several factors 
a reduction in semiconductor test systems sales volume contributed points  a million inventory provision recorded in semiconductor test systems for the write down of excess non flex inventory contributed points  and a shift in product mix within semiconductor test contributed points 
these decreases were offset in part by lower variable employee compensation which contributed point 
the breakout of product and service gross margin is as follows point change point change dollars in millions product gross margin percent of product revenue point change point change dollars in millions service gross margin percent of service revenue we assess the carrying value of our inventory on a quarterly basis by estimating future demand and comparing that demand against on hand and on order inventory positions 
forecasted revenue information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future revenue demand 
this quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory 
obsolete inventory  which represents items for which there is no demand  is fully reserved 
excess inventory  which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed during the next four quarters  is written down to estimated net realizable value 
these write offs and write downs consist of raw materials and components 
sales of previously reserved inventory items result in recovery of the related inventory provision  which is recorded in cost of revenues 
during the years ended december   and  we sold inventory that was previously reserved which had a favorable gross margin impact of million  million and million  respectively 
during the year ended december   we recorded inventory provisions in cost of revenues of million of which million was for excess inventory and million was for obsolete inventory 
of the million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded  million related to semiconductor test systems including an million provision for the write down of excess non flex inventory  million related to assembly test division and million related to other test systems 
during the year ended december   we recorded inventory provisions of million in cost of revenues of which million was for excess inventory and million was for obsolete inventory 
of the million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded  million related to semiconductor test systems including a million provision for the write down of excess non flex inventory  million related to assembly test systems and million related to other test systems 
during the year ended december   we recorded inventory provisions of million in cost of revenues of which million was for excess inventory and million was for obsolete inventory 
of the million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded  million related to semiconductor test systems  million related to assembly test systems and million related to other test systems 
we scrapped million  million  and million of inventory which had been previously written down or written off during the years ended december   and  respectively 
we have no set timeline for scrapping the remaining inventory 
as of december  and  we had inventory reserves for amounts which have been written down or written off of million and million  respectively 
of the reserves at december   million  million  million  and million relate to inventory provisions recorded in    and prior to  respectively 
engineering and development change change dollars in millions engineering and development percent of total revenue during and  we reduced our levels of investment in engineering and development spending 
more than of our total engineering and development expenses are incurred by the semiconductor test systems segment  where a new test platform requires up to three years for development and costs between and million 
during  semiconductor test systems completed its ultraflex platform development and shifted its focus to increasing the instrumentation set on its flex test platform ultraflex and flex which requires lower levels of engineering and development expenditures 
during  semiconductor test systems reduced the number of platforms under major development  which increased the resources for continued engineering on selective platforms 
the decrease of million in engineering and development spending from to consists of the following amounts million decrease due to a reduction in headcount primarily in the us  offset partially by an increase in engineering and development in low cost regions  and million decrease due to the completion of certain portions of the flex test platform engineering work 
these decreases were partially offset by the following million increase due to higher variable employee compensation  and million increase due to stock based compensation 
the decrease of million in engineering and development spending from to consists of the following amounts million decrease due to the completion of certain portions of the flex test platform engineering work  million decrease due to variable employee compensation  and million decrease in depreciation and facility costs as a result of facility closures and lower capital spending 
selling and administrative change change dollars in millions selling and administrative percent of total revenue the increase in selling and administrative spending of million from to consists of the following million increase due to higher variable employee compensation  million increase due to transitional expenses  including the consolidation of facilities in massachusetts and costs associated with the outsourcing of certain information technology functions  and million increase due to stock based compensation 
these increase were partially offset by the following million decrease due to a reduction in headcount  and million decrease in foreign exchange expense 
the decrease in selling and administrative spending of million from to is due primarily to an million decrease in variable compensation  offset by a million increase in sales support spending for the flex platform and a million increase in salaries and fringe benefits due to salary increases 
restructuring and other  net in response to a downturn in the industry  we initiated restructuring activities in across all segments to reduce costs and redundancies  principally through headcount reductions and facility consolidations 
further actions were initiated in  to a lesser extent in  and in additionally  in and  as part of our facility consolidation  we began selling certain real estate 
the tables below represent activity related to these actions 
the remaining accrual for severance and benefits is reflected in the accrued employees compensation and withholdings account on the balance sheet

in july  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program 
under the program  we may spend up to an aggregate of million to repurchase shares of our common stock in open market purchases  in privately negotiated transactions or through other appropriate means through july shares are to be repurchased at our discretion  subject to market conditions and other factors 
during  we repurchased million shares of common stock for million for an average price of 
subsequently  we have repurchased million shares of common stock for million through february  on october   we issued million principal amount of the notes in a private placement and received net proceeds of million 
the notes were convertible at the option of the holders at a rate which was equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share  which was equal to a conversion rate of approximately shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes 
we made annual interest payments of million  paid semi annually  on the notes commencing on april  on august   our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to million of the outstanding notes in open market purchases at negotiated prices below of the principal amount 
the board subsequently amended its authorization on october  to authorize repurchases through open market purchases  privately negotiated transaction  auctions  by redemption pursuant to the terms of the governing indenture or other means as determined by our ceo or cfo  at prices below of the principal amount 
the million authorization for repurchase was fully utilized by management during the third quarter of and the first and fourth quarters of to repurchase million  million and million of the notes  respectively 
the decision to repurchase a portion of the notes was based on the fair market value of the notes being below the return we would earn on high grade investment securities 
on january   management was given further authorization by our board to repurchase up to the full million of the principal amount that remained outstanding under the notes through open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions and auctions for a price not to exceed of the principal amount plus any accrued but unpaid interest thereon 
during  we repurchased notes of million in the first quarter  million in the third quarter  and we repaid the remaining million in the fourth quarter of on february   we announced the signing of a definitive agreement with mosaid technologies  inc of ottawa  canada to acquire enabling test technology for a purchase price of million 
the transaction is expected to close in march we believe our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of million will be sufficient to meet working capital and expenditure needs for at least the foreseeable future 
inflation has not had a significant long term impact on earnings 
retirement plans we adopted the funded status recognition provision of sfas effective december  this standard amends sfas    and r 
sfas requires an employer with defined benefit plans or other postretirement benefit plans to recognize an asset or a liability on its balance sheet for the overfunded or underfunded status of the plans as defined by sfas the pension asset or liability represents the difference between the fair value of the pension plan s assets and the projected benefit obligation as of december for other postretirement benefit plans  the liability is the difference between the fair value of the plan s assets and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december our pension expense  which includes the us qualified pension plan  certain qualified plans for non us subsidiaries and a supplemental executive defined benefit plan  was approximately million for the year ended december  the largest portion of our pension expense was million for our us qualified pension plan  which is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  including an expected return on plan assets for our us qualified pension plan assets of 
in developing the expected return on plan assets assumption  we evaluated input from our investment manager and pension consultants  including their review of asset class return expectations 
based on this review  we believe that was an appropriate rate to use for fiscal we will continue to evaluate its expected return on plan assets at least annually  and will adjust these returns as necessary 
the current asset allocation for our us qualified pension plan is invested in equity securities and invested in fixed income securities  which is in accordance with the plan s asset allocation requirements 
our actual asset allocation as of december  was virtually identical to the plan s asset allocation model 
our investment manager regularly reviews our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the portfolio to ensure alignment with our targeted allocations 
we base our determination of pension expense or income on a market related valuation of assets  which reduces year to year volatility 
this market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur 
investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return on assets 
since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period  the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized 
as of december   under the us qualified pension plan  we had cumulative gains of approximately million  which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of assets 
the discount rate that we utilized for determining future pension obligations for the us qualified pension plan is based on the citigroup pension liability index formerly salomon brothers pension liability index  which was at at december   up from at december  as a result  we selected for its december  discount rate  which was up from as of december  the duration of the citigroup pension liability index at december  was years  which approximates the duration of the portfolio of pension liabilities 
we estimate that our pension expense for the us qualified pension plan will be approximately million in the pension expense estimate for is based on a discount rate 
future actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in our pension plans 
as of december   we had unrecognized pension losses of million  of which million is for the us plan 
we performed a sensitivity analysis  which expresses the estimated us qualified pension plan pension expense that would have resulted for the year ended december   if we changed either the discount rate or the expected return on plan assets 
discount rate return on plan assets in millions our funding policy is to make contributions to the plans in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible 
the assets of these plans consist primarily of equity and fixed income securities 
the value of our us qualified pension plan assets has increased from million at december  to million at december  our contributions and investment performance have eliminated the deficit of our us qualified pension plan  net of benefit obligations  of million at december  and created a surplus of million at december  during  we contributed million to the us qualified pension plan 
based upon the plan s funded status as of december  we do not expect to make any contributions in to this plan

 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas  which requires companies to recognize the funded status of their defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on the balance sheet 
the funded status is calculated as the difference between the fair value of the plan s asset and the benefit obligation of the plan  which results in the recognition of a net liability or net asset 
for a pension plans  the benefit obligation is a projected benefit obligation the pbo  for other postretirement benefit plans  the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation the apbo 
the projected benefit obligation the pbo represents actuarial present value of vested and non vested benefits attributed to the plan through the pension benefit formula for service rendered to that date based on employees future salary levels 
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation the apbo represents an actuarial present value of benefits attributed to employee service that has been rendered to date 
additionally  sfas requires that any pension or post retirement benefit related unrecognized gains losses  prior service costs credits  and net transition assets obligations expected to be recognized as part of net periodic benefit cost in future periods  be recorded within other comprehensive income loss

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s concentration of credit risk financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash investments  forward currency contracts and accounts receivable 
we maintain cash and marketable securities investments primarily in us treasury and government agency securities and corporate debt securities  rated aa or higher  which have minimal credit risk 
we place forward currency contracts with high credit quality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and from time to time may require customers to provide a letter of credit from a bank to secure accounts receivable 
exchange rate risk management we regularly enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the value of our net monetary assets in the european euro  great britain pound  japanese yen and the taiwan dollar 
these foreign currency forward contracts have maturities of less than one year 
these contracts are used to reduce our risk associated with exchange rate movements  as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures 
in addition  we periodically hedge anticipated cash flow transactions with foreign currency forward contracts 
the gains and losses on these contracts are deferred and recognized in the same period as the hedged transaction is recognized in income 
we do not engage in currency speculation 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical fluctuation in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above 
as of december  and  the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
interest rate risk management we are exposed to potential loss due to changes in interest rates 
the principal interest rate exposure is to changes in domestic interest rates 
investments with interest rate risk include short and long term marketable securities 
in order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk  a fluctuation in interest rates was assumed 
market risk for the short and long term marketable securities was estimated as the potential change in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio 
on these bases  the potential change in fair value from changes in interest rates is million and million as of december  and  respectively
