by identifying these statements for you in this manner  we are alerting you to the possibility that our actual results may differ  possibly materially  from the results indicated in the forward looking statements 
important factors that could  among others  cause our results to differ  possibly materially  from those indicated in the forward looking statements are discussed above under business factors that may affect our business in part i  item of this annual report on form k 
executive overview can be characterized as a year of accomplishments and challenges 
we experienced an increase in our loan portfolio  led by strong growth in construction lending 
deposits increased by despite a very competitive environment 
we posted net income of million  representing record earnings for our company 
we agreed to a cease and desist order with the fdic and the dfi requiring us to improve compliance with the detection  monitoring and reporting requirements of the bank secrecy act 
our primary focus in was expanding and solidifying deposit relationships to support our strong loan demand and to mitigate the impact of competitive factors and interest rate driven shifts in deposit composition 
we also dedicated significant attention to enhancing our risk monitoring systems and improving our compliance processes 
asset quality remained strong  with a net loan charge off ratio of for the year and the ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate of as of year end our key profitability measures held steady  with net income to average tangible shareholders equity at  return on average assets at and the efficiency ratio at 
for a further discussion of these trends and other factors affecting our business  see overview of results of operations 
an annual examination of the bank by the fdic and dfi identified weaknesses in our bsa compliance program that resulted in the issuance of a cease and desist order 
we have devoted substantial attention and increased resources to the remediation of deficiencies in our compliance efforts and expect to fully comply with the order by mid year see supervision and regulation anti money laundering initiatives and usa patriot act  for further discussion 
business environment the majority of our operations are concentrated in the states of hawaii and california  and to a lesser extent  washington 
accordingly  our business performance is directly affected by conditions in the banking industry  macro economic conditions and real estate market in those states 
a favorable business environment is generally characterized by expanding gross state product  low unemployment and rising personal income 
general economic conditions in hawaii moderated in after two years of exceptional growth in and tourism remains hawaii s most significant economic driver  and according to the hawaii department of business economic development tourism dbedt  million visitors visited the state in  down slightly from the record million visitor arrivals in however  increased daily visitor spending boosted total visitor spending to a record billion  an increase of over the department of labor and industrial relations reported that hawaii s unemployment rate was in december  compared to in december hawaii s unemployment rate ranked the lowest among the states  well below the national unemployment rate of 
the dbedt projects real personal income growth to approximate in  and remain in the range in through the dbedt also projects real gross state product growth of in and approximately growth per annum in the next three years 
with real estate lending as a primary focus  including construction loans  residential mortgages and commercial mortgages  we are also dependent on the strength of the real estate market 
following several years of strong growth  the hawaii real estate market cooled in according to the honolulu board of realtors  for the full year  oahu unit sales volume was down for single family homes and down for condominiums 
additionally  the median sales prices in for single family homes and condominiums on oahu were  and  respectively  representing increases of and  respectively  over the median prices in expectations are for the hawaii real estate market to continue to moderate with slight declines in unit sales volumes and sales prices likely in the economy in california also experienced moderate growth in over the months ending in october  california nonfarm employment grew by  jobs  or from a year ago  according to the california department of finance cdof 
cdof also reported that california s unemployment rate in october of was the state s lowest in at least years 
the california association of realtors car reported that december unit home sales declined  while the median price increased  from year ago levels 
car forecasts a modest decline in home prices and unit sales in the washington economy continued to expand led by gains at microsoft and boeing 
according to the washington state employment security department  the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was in december  a decrease of from the year ago rate 
from the washington state economic and revenue forecast council  or erfc  total payroll employment in washington rose in fiscal  up from in booming construction growth coupled with strong growth in both aerospace and software accounted for the improved employment picture 
employment growth is forecasted to moderate over the next year due to a leveling off of construction employment and slower aerospace employment growth 
the washington center for real estate research reported that third quarter unit home sales declined  while the median price increased  from year ago levels 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires that management make certain judgments and use certain estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosures made 
accounting estimates are deemed critical when a different estimate could have reasonably been used or where changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and would materially impact our consolidated financial statements as of or for the periods presented 
management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates noted below with the audit committee of the board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the accompanying disclosures 
allowance for loan losses we maintain the allowance for loan losses  or the allowance  at an amount we expect to be sufficient to absorb probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio based on a projection of probable net loan charge offs 
for loans classified as impaired  an estimated impairment loss is calculated 
to estimate net loan charge offs on other loans  we evaluate the level and trend of nonperforming and potential problem loans and historical loss experience 
we also consider other relevant economic conditions and borrower specific risk characteristics  including current repayment patterns of our borrowers  the fair value of collateral securing  specific loans  changes in our lending and underwriting standards and general economic factors  nationally and in the markets we serve 
estimated loss rates are determined by loan category and risk profile  and an overall required allowance is calculated 
based on our estimate of the level of allowance required  a provision for loan losses  or the provision  is recorded to maintain the allowance at an appropriate level 
since we cannot predict with certainty the amount of loan charge offs that will be incurred  and because the eventual level of loan charge offs are impacted by numerous conditions beyond our control  a range of loss estimates could reasonably have been used to determine the allowance and provision 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination processes  periodically review the company s allowance 
such agencies may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
accordingly  actual results could differ from those estimates 
goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we review the carrying amount of goodwill for impairment on an annual basis 
additionally  we perform an impairment assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets may not be recoverable 
significant changes in circumstances can be both internal to our strategic and financial direction  as well as changes to the competitive and economic landscape 
our impairment assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets involves the estimation of future cash flows and the fair value of reporting units to which goodwill is allocated 
estimating future cash flows and determining fair values of the reporting units is judgmental and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of the impairment charge 
deferred tax assets and tax contingencies we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes 
deferred taxes assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards 
a valuation allowance may be required if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary  we consider the level of taxable income in prior years  to the extent that carrybacks are permitted under current tax laws  as well as estimates of future taxable income and tax planning strategies that could be implemented to accelerate taxable income if necessary 
if our estimates of future taxable income were materially overstated  or if our assumptions regarding the tax consequences of tax planning strategies were inaccurate  some or all of our deferred tax assets may not be realized  which would result in a charge to earnings 
we have established income tax reserves for potential tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions 
tax benefits are recognized when it is deemed probable that such benefits will be realized 
where uncertainty exists due to the complexity of income tax statutes  and where ethe potential tax amounts are significant  we generally seek independent tax opinions to support our positions 
if our evaluation of the likelihood of favorable outcome is inaccurate  we could incur additional income tax and interest expense than would adversely impact earnings  or we could receive tax benefits greater than anticipated which would positively impact earnings 
defined benefit retirement plan defined benefit plan obligations and related assets of our defined benefit retirement plan are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
plan assets  which consist primarily of marketable equity and debt securities  are typically valued using market quotations 
plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by independent actuaries through the use of a number of assumptions 
key assumptions in measuring the plan obligations include the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
in determining the discount rate  we utilize a yield that reflects the top of the universe of bonds  ranked in the order of the highest yield 
asset returns are based upon the anticipated average rate of earnings expected on the invested funds of the plans 
at december   we used a weighted average discount rate of and an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of  which affected the amount of pension liability recorded as of year end and the amount of pension expense to be recorded in at december   a weighted average discount rate of and an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of were used in determining the pension liability recorded as of year end and the amount of pension expense recorded in for both the discount rate and the asset return rate  a range of estimates could reasonably have been used which would affect the amount of pension expense and pension liability recorded 
an increase in the discount rate or asset return rate would reduce pension expense in  while a decrease in the discount rate or asset return rate would have the opposite effect 
a change in the discount rate assumption would impact pension expense by million and year end pension liability by million  while a change in the asset return rate would impact pension expense by million 
overview of results of operations our net income in of million increased by million  or  over the million earned in  which increased by million  or  over the million earned in net income in included after tax charges totaling million relating to executive retirement expenses  income tax liability adjustments  investment securities portfolio repositioning and an employee benefit related liabilities adjustment that are not expected to recur in the increase in net income in reflected growth in net interest income and other operating income which more than offset increased operating expenses

net interest income expressed on a taxable equivalent basis  totaled million in  increasing by million or over the net interest income of million in  which increased by million or over the net interest income of million recognized in the increases in net interest income reflect increases in average loans and deposits generated organically in each of the years presented  as well as the impact of the cb bancshares merger in in addition  the movement in interest rates contributed positively to the increase in net interest income in but had the opposite effect in interest income interest income expressed on a taxable equivalent basis of million in increased by million or over the million earned in  which increased by million or from million in primary sources of interest income include interest on loans  which represented  and of interest income in  and  respectively  as well as interest earned on investment securities  which represented  and of interest income in  and  respectively 
as depicted in table  the increase in interest income in is due primarily to the increase in average loan balances and the increase in average yields thereon 
average interest earning assets of billion in  increased by million or over s average balance due largely to an increase of million or in average loans 
the average yield on interest earning assets of in increased by basis points over the average yield of  with loan yields increasing by basis points to reflect the increase in the general level of market interest rates 
comparing results to those of  the increase in interest income can be attributed to increases of billion or in average loans and million or in average investment securities 
the increases in average balances in and reflect organic loan growth  particularly in the construction lending portfolio 
loans and investment securities also increased in as a result of the cb bancshares merger and the effect of several capital markets leveraging strategies employed 
interest expense interest expense of million in increased by million or compared to million in  which increased by million or compared to million in in  average interest bearing liabilities of billion increased by million or  including increases of million in average interest bearing deposits and million in average long term debt 
the average rate on interest bearing liabilities increased by basis points due primarily to a basis point increase in rates paid on interest bearing deposits 
competitive pricing in the hawaii market  coupled with promotional rates offered in connection with our exceptional account campaigns resulted in the higher funding costs in  particularly for savings and money market deposits and time deposits of  and over 
in  increases in average interest bearing liabilities and the averages rates paid thereon were the primary drivers of the increase in interest expense 
average interest bearing liabilities of billion in increased by billion or over  including an increase in average interest bearing deposits of million 
the increase in average interest bearing deposits in was attributed to the deposits acquired in the cb bancshares merger and organic growth in commercial and retail deposits generated through sales and referral campaigns 
the average rate paid on interest bearing deposits increased by basis points in  following general market interest rate trends during the period 
average long term debt of million increased by million or in as compared to the prior year  reflecting the borrowings assumed in the cb bancshares merger  coupled with subordinated debt issued in  the proceeds of which were used to fund the cash component of the cb bancshares merger consideration 
net interest margin our net interest margin was  and in  and  respectively 
the decline in net interest margin in and the increase in net interest margin in can be attributed to the differences in timing of rate movements in our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in  the basis point increase in yield on total interest earnings assets exceeded the basis point increase in rate on total interest bearing liabilities 
in contrast  the basis point increase in yield on interest earning assets experienced in fell short of the basis point increase in average rate on interest bearing liabilities 
the mismatched timing of rate movements resulted from delayed deposit repricings in the hawaii market 
based on our expectations for loan and deposit growth and market interest rate movements in  we anticipate stable to declining asset yields and moderate increases in deposit rates  resulting in further compression of our net interest margin to a range of to for the coming year 
however  our ability to generate continued growth in loans  which typically bring higher yields than other interest earning assets  our ability to fund that asset growth with relatively low cost core deposits and competitive pricing factors will directly impact our anticipated future net interest margins and net interest income

for  the most notable increases in total other operating income included a million or increase in service charges on deposits and a million or increase in other service charges and fees 
increases were attributable to a combination of the cbbi and hhl acquisitions in general  and specifically to higher nsf fees and residential mortgage servicing fees  respectively 
investment securities gain losses swung from a net loss in to a net gain of million in  and gains on sales of loans increased by million or due to the higher level of mortgage origination activity resulting from the two acquisitions

income taxes income tax expense totaled million in  increasing from million in and million in the effective tax rate was in  in and in the increase in effective tax rates reflects the increasing proportion of income subject to taxation in the state of california  which has a higher state tax rate than the state of hawaii 
income tax expense in also reflects a million adjustment to our income tax liability relating to our accounting for the net income tax benefits from tax credits earned

loan portfolio we focus our lending activities on commercial  commercial mortgage and construction loans to small and middle market companies  business professionals and real estate developers 
our strategy for generating new loans relies upon teams of highly qualified commercial real estate and commercial banking officers organized by geographical and industry lines who are responsible for client prospecting and business development 
we have established six loan production offices in california and washington staffed by experienced lenders with established client relationships in their respective markets 
the expansion of lending activities in these markets augments our lending activities in hawaii to supplement our growth opportunities and improve the diversification of our loan portfolio 
loans total billion at december   increasing by million or over the billion at year end  which increased by million or over the billion held at year end growth in our construction portfolio and residential mortgage lending continued through and construction loans and residential mortgage loans increased by and  respectively  compared to the growth in our construction portfolio and residential mortgage lending were partially offset by a slowdown in our commercial  financial and agricultural lending  as well as our commercial mortgage lending  which decreased by and  respectively  when compared to levels 
during  approximately million  or of total loan growth was derived from our offices in california  and approximately million or of total loan growth was generated in washington 
our hawaii lending activities were of total loan growth and were negatively impacted by large  unanticipated loan prepayments  particularly from our commercial mortgage portfolio  resulting from our borrowers sales of the subject properties 
to manage credit risk ie  the inability of borrowers to repay their loan obligations  management analyzes the borrower s financial condition  repayment source  collateral  and other factors that could impact credit quality  such as national and local economic conditions and industry conditions related to respective borrowers 
table sets forth information regarding outstanding loans by category as of the dates indicated 
table loans by categories december  dollars in thousands commercial  financial and agricultural real estate construction mortgage residential commercial consumer leases total loans allowance for loan and lease losses net loans commercial  financial and agricultural loans in this category consist primarily of term loans and lines of credit to small and middle market businesses and professionals located in the state of hawaii 
the borrower s business is typically regarded as the principal source of repayment  although our underwriting policy and practice generally requires additional sources of collateral  including real estate and other business assets  as well as personal guarantees where possible to mitigate risk 
risks of credit losses are greater in this loan category relative to secured loans  such as commercial and residential mortgages where a greater percentage of the loan amount is usually covered by collateral 
nonetheless  any collateral or personal guarantees obtained on commercial loans can mitigate the increased risk and help to reduce credit losses 
commercial loans decreased by million or to million at year end the increase experienced in of million was largely a result of the cb bancshares merger 
our approach to commercial lending involves teams of lending and cash management personnel who focus on marketing loans  deposits and other bank services to new and existing commercial clients 
we have also been successful in hiring experienced personnel with established networks of business contacts to support commercial sales efforts 
sustained long term growth in this loan category will be dependent upon local economic conditions  interest rate levels  competitive market conditions and other external factors 
real estate construction construction loans offered include both residential and commercial development projects 
each construction project is evaluated for economic viability  and maximum loan to value ratios of on commercial projects and on residential projects are generally required 
a construction loan poses higher credit risks than typical secured loans 
in addition to the financial strength of the borrower  construction loans have the added element of completion risk  which is the risk that the project will not be completed on time and within budget  resulting in additional costs that could affect the economic viability of the project 
careful consideration of the ability and reputation of the developer and close monitoring of a project during the construction phase by construction lending specialists is required to mitigate the higher level of risk in construction lending 
construction loans of billion at year end increased by million or over the million held at year end  which increased by million or over year end the increase in construction loan volume is the result of our focus on this segment and the strong real estate market and increased development activity in all our markets 
the growth experienced in also reflects the impact of the cb bancshares merger 
construction loans tend to be larger in amount and shorter in term than conventional commercial or mortgage loans  thus a higher level of volatility in balances from year to year is expected 
real estate mortgage table sets forth information with respect to the composition of the real estate mortgage loan portfolio as of the dates indicated 
table mortgage loan portfolio composition december  amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent dollars in thousands residential units or more units commercial  industrial and other total real estate mortgage residential 
residential mortgage loans include both fixed and adjustable rate loans primarily secured by single family owner occupied residences 
maximum loan to value ratios of are typically required  although higher levels are permitted with accompanying mortgage insurance 
we emphasize residential mortgage loans for owner occupied primary residences and do not actively seek loans on high end residences  vacation homes and investment properties 
first mortgage loans secured by residential properties generally carry a moderate level of credit risk 
with an average loan size of approximately  readily marketable collateral and a strong residential real estate market  credit losses on residential mortgages have been minimal during the past several years 
however  future changes in interest rates and other market factors can impact the marketability of collateral and thus the level of credit risk inherent in the portfolio 
as with all loans  managing credit risk in the residential mortgage market entails strong underwriting standards and diligent monitoring and handling of problems that may arise 
residential mortgage loan balances as of december  totaled million  increasing by million or over the million at year end  which increased by million or over the million held at year end substantially all salable fixed rate mortgages are sold in the secondary market 
mortgage loans held for sale at december  totaled million  a decrease of million or over the december  balance of million  which increased by million or over the december  balance of million 
the spike in loans held for sale as of december  was attributed to several bulk project financings that occurred near year end 
increases in residential mortgage interest rates during the past year and the cooling of the hawaii residential real estate market is expected to have a negative impact on refinancing activity in  although we expect to supplement our mortgage origination activity with financings of several condominium projects scheduled for completion during the year 
real estate mortgage commercial 
real estate mortgage loans secured by commercial properties continues to represent the single largest component of our loan portfolio 
our policy with respect to commercial mortgages is that loans be made for sound purposes  have a definite source and or plan of repayment established at inception  and be backed up by reliable secondary sources of repayment and satisfactory collateral with good marketability 
loans secured by commercial property carry a greater risk than loans secured by residential property due to operating income risk  which is the risk that the borrower will be unable to generate sufficient cash flow from the operation of the property 
the commercial real estate market and interest rate conditions through economic cycles will impact risk levels 
to mitigate the risks inherent in commercial mortgage lending  we use dedicated  experienced commercial mortgage lenders to underwrite  monitor and service commercial mortgage loans 
further  commercial mortgage lending generated by our california and washington loan production offices has improved the geographic diversification of our loan portfolio 
while providing greater opportunities for growth and diversification  mainland lending also exposes us to new risks  including the risk of economic downturn in those markets  and a reliance on a relatively small staff positioned in those markets 
to manage these risks  key executive officers with significant experience in mainland markets actively monitor and manage our mainland lending activities 
as of december   commercial mortgage loans totaled billion  a decrease of million or over the billion held at year end  which increased by million or compared to the billion held at year end the strong commercial real estate market  while providing significant lending opportunities  also resulted in unanticipated payoffs as a result of the sales of the underlying collateral 
thus  despite robust origination activity  commercial mortgage loans declined in the increase in commercial mortgages in was largely attributable to the cb bancshares merger 
we expect loan origination activity to decline in as a result of a slowdown in the commercial real estate market and anticipated payoffs from our existing portfolio 
consumer loans table sets forth the major components of our consumer loan portfolio as of the dates indicated 
table consumer loan portfolio composition december  amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent dollars in thousands automobile credit cards and other revolving credit plans other total for consumer loans  credit risk is managed on a pooled basis 
considerations include an evaluation of the quality  character and inherent risks in the loan portfolio  current and projected economic conditions  and past loan loss experience 
consumer loans represent a moderate credit risk 
loans in this category are either unsecured or secured by personal assets such as automobiles 
the average loan size is generally small  and risk is diversified among many borrowers 
we utilize credit scoring systems for most of our consumer loans  which offer the ability to modify credit exposure based on our risk tolerance and loss experience 
consumer loans totaled million at december   increasing by million or from s year end balance of million  which decreased by million or compared to the million held at year end automobile loans  primarily indirect dealer loans  comprised of consumer loans outstanding 
total automobile loans of million at year end increased by million or from s year end balance of million  which decreased by million or over the million at year end we have not focused significant resources on consumer lending in recent years as several large competitors have dominated the hawaii market 
with the exception of indirect dealer loans  consumer loans are generally offered as an accommodation to existing customers 
while it is expected to remain a relatively small segment of our lending business  we believe that consumer lending provides opportunities to further diversify our loan portfolio and to compensate for anticipated declines in other sectors 
as such  we anticipate moderate growth in consumer lending in the future 
concentrations of credit risk as of december   approximately of loans outstanding were real estate related loans  including construction loans  residential mortgage loans and commercial mortgage loans 
the real estate market tends to closely follow broader economic trends  and during periods of economic strength  as we are currently experiencing  the real estate market and the real estate industry typically perform well 
however  market interest rates and other economic conditions can have a significant and immediate impact on the real estate industry 
accordingly  the concentration of lending in the real estate industry creates the risk of adverse portfolio performance  namely delinquencies and loan charge offs  should the real estate market suffer a downturn 
substantially all of our loans are made to companies and individuals with headquarters in or residing in the states of hawaii  california and washington 
while the concentration of lending activities within the state of hawaii is consistent with our focus of being a hawaii based bank  lending activities outside of hawaii help to diversify risk and provide for additional growth opportunities 
loans originated by our mainland loan production offices accounted for approximately of total loan growth 
as a result  the concentration of mainland loans increased to approximately of total loans outstanding as of year end  compared to approximately as of year end based on our assessment of market opportunities  we anticipate more balanced growth from our hawaii and mainland markets in to ensure that risks associated with industry concentration or geographic concentration are properly managed  we employ highly qualified lenders with established client relationships  similar lending philosophies and demonstrated expertise in their respective markets 
we did not have any foreign credit exposure as of december  that exceeded of total assets

our methodology for determining the adequacy of the allowance and the provision takes into account many factors  including the level and trend of nonperforming and potential problem loans  net charge off experience  current repayment by borrowers  fair value of collateral securing specific loans  changes in lending and underwriting standards and general economic factors  nationally and in the markets we serve 
the allowance consists of two components allocated and unallocated 
to calculate the allocated component  we combine specific reserves required for individual loans including impaired loans  reserves required for pooled graded loans and loan concentrations  and reserves required for homogeneous loans eg  consumer loans and residential mortgage loans 
we use a loan grading system whereby loans are segregated by risk 
certain graded commercial and commercial real estate loans are analyzed on an individual basis 
other graded loans are analyzed on an aggregate basis based on loss experience for the specific loan type  risks inherent in concentrations by geographic location  collateral or property type  and recent changes in loan grade and delinquencies 
the determination of an allocated allowance for homogeneous loans is done on an aggregate level based upon various factors including historical loss experience  delinquency trends and economic conditions 
the unallocated component of the allowance incorporates our judgment of the determination of the risks inherent in the loan portfolio  economic uncertainties  and imprecision in the estimation process 
the provision was million in  compared to million in and million in the decrease in the provision in is reflective of the decrease in nonaccrual loans  which totaled million at year end compared to million at year end and the decrease in loans delinquent for days or more  which declined to million at year end from million as of the previous year end 
refer to the section nonperforming assets for further discussion on nonaccrual and delinquent loans 
net loan charge offs of million in increased by million over the net loans charge offs of million in  which increased from million in when expressed as a percentage of average loans  net charge offs were in and and in charge offs in totaled million  including million in commercial loans and million in consumer loans 
commercial loan charge offs included a million charge off on a commercial line to a construction contractor to whom the bank had another million outstanding and million in undisbursed commitments as of year end consumer loan charge offs in were comprised primarily of indirect automobile loans  which totaled million 
recoveries in totaled million and included million in commercial loans and million in consumer loans 
charge offs in totaled million  including million in commercial loans and million in consumer loans  while recoveries totaling million included million in commercial loans and million in consumer loans 
the allowance as a percentage of loans was at year end  compared to at year end and at year end the decline in the level of the allowance during this period reflects the relatively low ratio of nonperforming loans  loan delinquencies and loan losses to total loans that we experienced in the last several years 
confidence in the strength of the local and national economies and the absence of significant adverse conditions also support the reduced level of the allowance as a percentage of loans 
however  general economic conditions do not affect all borrowers in the same way or to the same extent  and there remains the risk that certain borrowers or certain sectors of the economy could experience problems resulting in increased delinquencies and charge offs 
also  the local and national economies remain susceptible to global  national and local events which could adversely affect borrowers ability to repay their loans  collateral values  the level of nonperforming loans  net charge offs  provision and net income in the future

our practice is to make specific allocations on loans with risk classifications of substandard or doubtful and unspecified allocations to each loan category based on management s risk assessment and estimated loss rate 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is maintained to provide for additional credit risk which may exist but not be adequately accounted for in the specific and unspecified allocations due to the amount of judgment involved in the determination of the allowance  the absence of perfect knowledge of all credit risks and the amount of uncertainty in predicting the strength of the economy and the sustainability of that strength

allowance allocated to commercial loans at year end totaled million or of total commercial loans  compared to million or of total commercial loans as of year end the decrease in the allocated allowance reflects the decrease in commercial loans outstanding and the relatively low net charge offs experienced in the past several years 
allowance allocated to construction loans totaled million or of construction loans at year end  compared to million  or of construction loans outstanding at year end the increase in the amount of allowance allocated to construction loans is consistent with the increase in loan volumes  and the increased reserve ratio reflects the higher level of risk inherent in construction lending as compared to other types of loans 
the allocated allowance for residential mortgage loans was million or of related loans at year end  compared to million or at year end the increase in the allocated allowance reflects the increase in balances during the period and the higher level of risk in the face of a slowing residential real estate market 
commercial mortgage loans were allocated an allowance of million or of those loans at year end  decreasing from million or of commercial mortgage loans at year end the decrease in allocated allowance reflects the decrease in balances during the year  the absence of commercial mortgage charge offs during the past three years and the decline in nonaccrual and delinquent commercial mortgage loans as of year end the allocated allowance for consumer loans at year end was million or of consumer loans  compared to million or of related loans a year ago 
the slight increase in allocated allowance is consistent with the higher level of net loan charge offs experienced in the last three years 
we also allocated allowance for leases of million or of total leases compared to million or of total leases as of year end we have had minimal experience in our lease portfolio  which was acquired in primarily in conjunction with the cb bancshares merger 
nonetheless  based on our analysis of the lease portfolio  we believe there are inherent credit risks that we have recognized in our allowance 
the unallocated portion of the allowance declined slightly to million as of year end  compared to million in the reduction in the unallocated allowance reflects the continued strength in our credit quality and improvement in general economic conditions 
known and perceived risks attributable to particular market segments and geographical risk considerations have been incorporated into the determination of the allocated allowance

we believe our loss exposure on nonaccrual loans has been adequately provided for in our allowance as of december  accruing loans delinquent for days or more at year end totaled million  decreasing by million from the year end total of million 
the decrease was a result of the collection of a million commercial mortgage delinquency in from the borrower noted previously who filed for bankruptcy protection 
the remaining accruing loans delinquent for days or more at year end represented small loans of less than  each in various stages of collection 
aggressive monitoring and collection efforts have resulted in our ability to maintain the relatively low level of nonperforming asset and delinquent loan balances

deposits our ability to raise low cost funds is a principal contributor to our profitability  and the primary source of funding is deposits in the state of hawaii 
in this competitive market  we strive to distinguish ourselves by providing quality customer service in our branch offices and establishing long term relationships with businesses and their principals 
our focus has been to develop a large  stable base of core deposits  which are comprised of noninterest bearing demand  interest bearing demand and savings deposits and time deposits under  time deposits in amounts of  and greater are generally considered to be more price sensitive than relationship based  and are thus given less focus in our marketing and sales efforts

during  we focused most of our marketing resources on our flagship exceptional checking and exceptional money market savings accounts  whose combined balances of million at year end increased by million or during the year 
time deposits also increased in as depositors sought the higher returns offered on our time deposit products

we expect to continue our deposit growth strategy in  focusing primarily on core deposits  through competitive pricing and more aggressive marketing and customer calling campaigns 
table sets forth information regarding the average deposits and the average rates paid for certain deposit categories for each of the years indicated 
average balances are computed using daily average balances 
the average rates paid on all categories of deposits increased in due to increases in market interest rates in the hawaii deposit market 
the average rate on time deposits  which are most sensitive to changes in market rates  increased by basis points in over  while savings and money market deposit rates increased by basis points  and interest bearing demand deposit rates decreased by four basis points 
the average rate paid on all deposits in increased to from in and in we expect deposit rates to rise modestly in in response to strong competition for core deposits from other hawaii financial institutions as well as from internet based and other financial services companies located outside of hawaii 
the magnitude of rate movements in our deposit base will depend in large part on competitive pricing considerations and the level of deposit growth needed to support our lending activities

there were no stock repurchases during a total of  shares of common stock were repurchased in for consideration of million 
as a general strategy  management expects to maintain an ongoing stock repurchase program to enhance shareholder value while still supporting future growth opportunities and maintaining regulatory capital ratios at the well capitalized level 
asset liability management and interest rate risk our earnings and capital are sensitive to risk of interest rate fluctuations 
interest rate risk arises when rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities mature or reprice during different periods or in differing amounts 
in the normal course of business  we are subjected to interest rate risk through the activities of making loans and taking deposits  as well as from our investment securities portfolio and other interest bearing funding sources 
asset liability management attempts to coordinate our rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities to meet our financial objectives 
our asset liability management policy seeks to maximize the risk adjusted return to shareholders while maintaining consistently acceptable levels of liquidity  interest rate risk and capitalization 
our asset liability management committee  or alco  monitors interest rate risk through the use of interest rate sensitivity gap  net interest income and market value of portfolio equity simulation and rate shock analyses 
this process is designed to measure the impact of future changes in interest rates on net interest income and market value of portfolio equity 
adverse interest rate risk exposures are managed through the shortening or lengthening of the duration of assets and liabilities 
interest rate risk can be analyzed by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap and changes in the gap over time 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a specified time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  the earnings of an institution with a positive gap theoretically may be positively affected due to its interest earning assets repricing to a greater extent than its interest bearing liabilities 
an adverse impact would be expected for an institution with a negative gap 
table sets forth information regarding our interest rate sensitivity gap at december  the assumptions used in determining interest rate sensitivity of various asset and liability products had a significant impact on the resulting table 
for purposes of this presentation  assets and liabilities are classified by the earliest repricing date or maturity 
all interest bearing demand and savings balances are included in the three months or less category  even though repricing of these accounts is not contractually required and may not actually occur during that period 
since all interest rates and yields do not adjust at the same velocity or magnitude  and since volatility is subject to change  the interest rate sensitivity gap is only a general indicator of interest rate risk

these estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including the magnitude and timing of interest rate changes  prepayments on loans and investment securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment of asset and liability cashflows  and others 
table presents information on financial instruments held that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for purposes of this presentation  expected maturities of interest sensitive assets and liabilities are contractual maturities 
interest bearing demand and savings deposits  which have indeterminate maturities  are included in the earliest maturity category 
the resulting table is based on numerous assumptions including prepayment rates on mortgage related assets and forecasted market interest rates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the calculation of fair values 
at december   holdings of shorter term interest sensitive assets and liabilities increased slightly relative to year end maturities and fair values of interest sensitive assets and liabilities may vary from expectation if actual experience differs from the assumptions used 
liquidity our objective in managing our liquidity is to maintain a balance between sources and uses of funds in order to economically meet the cash requirements of customers for loans and deposit withdrawals and to participate in lending and investment opportunities as they arise 
we monitor our liquidity position in relation to trends of loan demand and deposit growth on a daily basis to assure maximum utilization  maintenance of an adequate level of readily marketable assets  and access to short term funding sources 
during  our overall liquidity position declined as loan growth exceeded the increase in deposits 
the consolidated statements of cash flows identify the three major categories of sources and uses of cash as operating  investing and financing activities 
as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows  cash provided by operating activities has provided a steady source of funds during the past three years 
cash provided by operating activities totaled million in  million in and million in the primary source of cash provided by operating activities continues to be the proceeds from sales of loans held for sale  which totaled million in compared to million in and million in investing activities have resulted in a use of cash in each of the last three years 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million in  million in and million in investment securities and lending activities generally comprise the largest components of investing activities  although the level of investment securities activities are impacted by the relationship of loan and deposit growth during the period 
in  net loan originations accounted for million of cash used  compared to million in and million in net proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities totaled million in compared to net purchases of investment securities of million in and million in investing activities in and also included the cash consideration paid in the hhl and cbbi acquisitions  respectively  net of cash and cash equivalents held by those entities at the time of the acquisitions 
cash provided by financing activities totaled million in  million in and million in deposit activities  borrowings and capital transactions represent the major components of financing activities 
net deposit growth resulted in cash inflows of million in  million in and million in cash flows from the issuance of long term debt  net of repayments thereon  totaled million in cash outflows in compared to million and million in cash inflows in and  respectively 
as with investment securities  the level of net borrowings is impacted by the levels of loan and deposit growth during the period 
capital transactions  primarily dividends and the issuance or repurchase of common stock  required cash outflows in totaling million  cash inflows in totaling million  and cash outflows in of million 
proceeds from the sale of common stock in included million generated from a common stock offering of million shares 
we expect that loan demand in will approximate deposit growth  resulting in limited additional liquidity needs 
alternative funding sources  which include the federal home loan bank of seattle  secured repurchase agreements  federal funds borrowings  brokered certificates of deposit and the federal reserve bank  are available to meet our liquidity needs 
for the holding company on a stand alone basis  the primary uses of funds in included dividend payments and a million capital contribution to central pacific bank 
dividend payments totaled million in  million in and million in the primary source of funds in was dividends received from central pacific bank 
other sources of funds in the past have included million in proceeds from the common stock offering in and proceeds from the issuance of trust preferred securities of million in off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we enter into off balance sheet arrangements to meet the financing needs of our banking customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit  standby letters of credit and financial guarantees written  forward foreign exchange contracts  forward interest rate contracts  interest rate swaps and options 
these instruments and the related off balance sheet exposures are discussed in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in the unlikely event that we must satisfy a significant amount of outstanding commitments to extend credit  liquidity will be adversely impacted  as will credit risk 
the remaining components of off balance sheet arrangements  primarily interest rate options and forward interest rate contracts related to our mortgage banking activities  are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations impact of new accounting standards various accounting authorities including the financial accounting standards board  the american institute of certified public accountants and the securities and exchange commission issue authoritative guidance on accounting policies and disclosure requirements
