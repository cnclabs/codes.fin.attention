item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview products 
we design  manufacture and market da vinci surgical systems  which are advanced surgical systems that we believe represent a new generation of surgery the third generation 
the da vinci surgical system consists of a surgeon s console  a patient side cart and a high performance vision system 
the product line also includes proprietary wristed instruments and surgical accessories 
the da vinci surgical system seamlessly translates the surgeon s natural hand movements on instrument controls at a console into corresponding micro movements of instruments positioned inside the patient through small puncture incisions  or ports 
we believe that the da vinci surgical system is the only commercially available technology that can provide the surgeon with intuitive control  range of motion  fine tissue manipulation capability and d hd visualization  while simultaneously allowing the surgeons to work through the small ports of minimally invasive surgery  or mis 
by placing computer enhanced technology between the surgeon and the patient  we believe that the da vinci surgical system enables surgeons to improve clinical outcomes while reducing the invasiveness of complex surgical procedures 
the da vinci surgical system is sold into multiple surgical specialties  principally urology  gynecology  cardiothoracic  and general surgery 

table of contents business model 
in our business model  we generate revenue from both the initial capital sales of da vinci surgical systems as well as recurring revenue  comprised of instrument  accessory  service  and training revenue 
the da vinci surgical system sells for approximately million to million  depending on configuration  and represents a significant capital equipment investment for our customers 
we then generate recurring revenue as our customers purchase our endowrist instruments and accessory products for use in performing procedures with the da vinci surgical system 
endowrist instruments and accessories will either expire or wear out as they are used in surgery and will need to be replaced as they are consumed 
we generate additional recurring revenue from ongoing system service and customer training 
we typically enter into service contracts at the time the system is sold 
these service contracts have been generally renewable at the end of the service period  generally at an annual rate of approximately  to  per year  depending on configuration of the underlying system 
since the introduction of the da vinci surgical system in  our established base of da vinci surgical systems has grown and robotic surgery volume has increased 
recurring revenue has grown at an equal or faster rate than capital revenue 
over the past five years  revenue generated from the sale of instruments and accessories  service and training increased from million  or of revenue  in fiscal to million  or of revenue  in fiscal to million  or of revenue  in fiscal to million  or of revenue  in fiscal to million  or of revenue  in fiscal we expect recurring revenue to become a larger percentage of total revenue in the future 
business events and trends introduction 
we experienced rapid growth during the years ended december  and  which was driven by the continued adoption of the da vinci surgical system for use in urologic  gynecologic  cardiothoracic  and general surgeries 
financial highlights 
revenue grew to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  recurring instrument  accessory  service  and training revenue grew to million during the year ended december   up from million during the year ended december  we sold da vinci surgical systems during the year ended december   an increase of compared to during the year ended december  as of december   we had a da vinci surgical system installed base of systems  in north america  in europe  and in the rest of the world 
operating income increased by to million  or of revenue  during the year ended december  from million  or of revenue during the year ended december  during the first quarter of  in accordance with sfas r  we began to record stock compensation expense for the estimated value of employee stock options and stock purchases 
stock compensation expense for the year ended december  was million 
stock compensation expenses are entirely non cash in nature 
no stock compensation expense was included in the consolidated results of operations 
our business continues to demonstrate the ability to generate significant positive cash flow while supporting our rapid business growth 
cash  cash equivalents  and investments increased by million from fiscal  as we ended fiscal with million in cash  cash equivalents  and investments 

table of contents procedure adoption we believe the adoption of da vinci surgery occurs surgical procedure by surgical procedure  and it is being adopted for those procedures which offer significant patient value 
the value of a surgical procedure to a patient is higher if it offers superior clinical outcomes  less surgical trauma  or both 
the procedures that have driven the most growth in our business recently are the da vinci prostatectomy and the da vinci hysterectomy 
in  da vinci prostatectomy procedures  which represented more than half of all the da vinci surgical procedures for the year  grew over from  and it is expected to grow at least from to the da vinci hysterectomy procedure was our fastest growing procedure from a percentage growth standpoint in  and it is expected to grow at least from to regulatory clearances 
we believe that we have obtained all of the clearances required to market our products to our targeted surgical specialties within the united states 
the following table lists chronologically our fda clearances to date july general laparoscopic procedures march non cardiac thoracoscopic procedures may prostatectomy procedures november cardiotomy procedures july cardiac revascularization procedures march urologic surgical procedures april gynecologic surgical procedures june pediatric surgical procedures new products 
in january  we launched the da vinci s surgical system 
the da vinci s surgical system shares the same core technology as the standard da vinci surgical system and also features fast setup  rapid instrument exchange  multi quadrant access and multi image display capabilities 
the da vinci s surgical system is an addition to the da vinci product line and is offered at a price approximately million above the standard da vinci surgical system price 
market response to the da vinci s surgical system has proven to be positive  as of the total systems sold during were da vinci s surgical systems 
many of our existing customers who invested in the standard da vinci surgical system identified the benefits of the robotic surgery and expanded their robotic programs with the da vinci s surgical system 
we will continue to sell  service and support the standard da vinci surgical system 
we will also continue to invest in product development in order to expand the utility and longevity of all da vinci surgical systems  instruments and accessories 
in january  we launched the high definition  d d hd vision system 
the d hd vision system provides more viewing area and enhances visualization of tissue planes and critical anatomy 
the digital zoom feature in the d hd vision system allows surgeons to magnify the surgical field of view without adjusting endoscope position and reduces interference between the endoscope and instruments 
we believe the new d hd vision system will enable improved surgical outcomes 
the d hd vision will be available as an option on new da vinci s surgical systems and as an upgrade option to our existing customers who own a da vinci s surgical system 
we launched several new instruments during the year ended december   including the tenaculuum  atrial retractor  endo pk dissector  the mega needle driver  and the mm instrument set for the da vinci s surgical system 

table of contents the tenaculum is primarily targeted for gynecological use and is a device used to manipulate and control the uterus  during a hysterectomy  or to control a fibroid during a myomectomy 
the atrial retractor is a cardiac tool designed to provide easier access during valve repair procedures 
we developed the endo pk dissector in cooperation with gyrus acmi  an industry leader in both tissue management technology and endoscopies 
the endo pk dissector is a fully articulating coagulator and dissector  which is patterned after gyrus successful lyons dissector 
the endo pk dissector addresses several needs for da vinci surgical system users 
as a dissector  it allows for highly precise dissection  delivers excellent coagulation performance as well as providing grasping capabilities 
we expect this instrument to be used within urology  gynecology  and general surgery 
we designed the da vinci mega needle driver specifically to handle larger needles  which are often required in gynecological surgery  such as the da vinci hysterectomy  as well as in general surgery 
as we continue to expand our instrument offering  we will provide our customers more surgical options and clinical capability  which we anticipate will lead to increased system usage 
facilities and information technology infrastructure 
we have made investments in facilities and information technology infrastructure to support current and future growth 
in late december  we invested approximately million to acquire an additional  square foot facility  located about one mile from our first sunnyvale  ca site  where we continue to maintain operations 
the acquisition of this new property tripled our square footage in sunnyvale and provided us with the necessary capacity to maintain all of our corporate functions  including manufacturing  together in sunnyvale  for several years to come 
in  we opened a new customer training facility and service support center at this location 
we have invested in information technology infrastructure to upgrade our general ledger and manufacturing systems to a new sap system 
the implementation of this new system was completed in may total capital expenditures for were million 
technology acquisitions 
in january  we licensed  on a non exclusive basis  a number of suction cardiac stabilizer related patents and applications from medtronic to make and sell suction stabilizers that are mechanically coupled to and manipulated by robotic devices 
in march  we licensed  on a non exclusive basis  patents to force reflecting haptic devices and associated software from sensable technology to use in the robotic surgical systems 
in june  we licensed  on a non exclusive basis  pk electrosurgical instruments and eletrosurgical generator related patent and application from gyrus group plc to make and sell pk instruments and gyrus electrosurgical generators with robotic systems in the field of surgeries 
international reorganization 
in january  we announced plans to restructure our international operations 
we plan to shut down our international headquarters located in france and re establish our international headquarters in switzerland 
we believe this restructuring will streamline our international operations and optimize our tax structure for the long term 
we do not anticipate realizing benefits from the lower tax rates until fiscal at the earliest 
the current restructuring plan will result in costs for relocation of the european operations and certain employees  severance of certain employees  the set up of new facilities and information technology infrastructure  and other costs associated with the transition 
based upon the plan  we expect to incur costs of approximately million through the second quarter of fiscal

we believe that the adoption of robotic surgery will occur surgical procedure by surgical procedure 
our revenue growth during the periods presented reflects adoption progress made in our target procedures 
da vinci prostatectomy dvp has been our most successful procedure to date 
an increasing body of clinical evidence has indicated dvp to offer superior surgical outcomes compared to traditional open prostatectomy in the critical categories of cancer removal  continence  and sexual potency 
in  da vinci hysterectomy dvh emerged as our fastest growing procedure on a percentage of growth basis 
favorable clinical results have been reported in hysterectomies for cancerous pathology  which include increased lymph node retrieval counts and significant reduction in blood transfusion 
for most patients  a minimally invasive approach using the da vinci surgical system offers reduced pain  less blood loss  shorter hospital stays and a quicker return to normal daily activities 
revenue within the united states accounted for of total revenue during the years ended december  and  and during the year ended december  we believe domestic revenue accounts for the large majority of total revenue due largely to the competitive nature of the domestic healthcare market 
we 
table of contents also believe that at this stage  as we penetrate the early adopters of robotic surgery  revenue will continue to concentrate in the us market  as us hospitals are generally more willing to invest in technology that will drive incremental patients into their healthcare systems 
we expect that as adoption progresses and as we reach standard of care for target procedures  international revenue will increase as a percentage of overall revenue 
the following table summarizes our revenue and da vinci surgical system unit sales for the past three years in millions  except unit sales revenue instruments and accessories systems total product revenue service and training total revenue recurring revenue of total revenue domestic international total revenue da vinci surgical system unit sales product revenue product revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the million increase reflects higher revenue of systems  instruments  and accessories
