item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this form k 
overview we are an ophthalmic product development company focused on ophthalmic pharmaceutical products based on our proprietary durasite eyedrop based drug delivery technology  as well as the development of genetically based technologies for the diagnosis  prognosis and management of glaucoma 
we face significant challenges related to our lack of financial resources 
we only expect our current cash to enable us to continue our operations as currently planned until approximately the end of june our independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph in their audit report related to our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december  referring to our recurring operating losses and a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
with our existing resources we are focusing our research and development and commercial efforts on the following azasite isv  a durasite formulation of azithromycin  to serve as a broad spectrum ocular antibiotic  and azasite plus isv  a durasite formulation of azithromycin and a steroid for inflammation and pain 
in june  we completed the compilation and assembly of an azasite nda  and submitted the documentation to the fda 
based on the fda s prescription drug user fee act  or pdufa  we anticipate a ruling by the fda on the potential approval of azasite by the end of april from our inception through the end of  we did not receive any revenues from the sale of our products  other than a small amount of royalties from the sale of our aquasite product by ciba vision and global damon 
in the fourth quarter of  we commercially launched our ocugene glaucoma genetic test and early in we began to receive a small amount of revenues from the sale of this test 
with the exception of and the six month period ended june   we have been unprofitable since our inception due to continuing research and development efforts  including preclinical studies  clinical trials and manufacturing of our product candidates 
we have financed our research and development activities and operations primarily through private and public placements of equity and debt securities  issuance of convertible debentures  collaborative agreements and bridge loans 
recent developments on february   we entered into a worldwide  exclusive  royalty bearing licensing agreement with pfizer  under pfizer s patent family titled method of treating eye infections with azithromycin for ocular anti infective product candidates known as azasite and azasite plus 
under the pfizer license  we are required to pay pfizer a single digit royalty based on net sales of the licensed products and to use reasonable commercial efforts to seek regulatory approval for and market licensed products 
we can grant sublicenses under the pfizer license  subject to pfizer s prior approval  which the pfizer license provides shall not be unreasonably withheld 
on february   we entered into a license agreement with inspire  under which we licensed to inspire exclusive development and commercialization rights  under our azasite patent rights and certain know how  for topical anti infective products containing azithromycin as the sole active ingredient for human ocular or ophthalmic indications in the territory 
the inspire license also provides for nonexclusive licenses under our durasite patent rights  container patent rights  columbia patent rights and certain know how in the same field of use as described above as well as an exclusive sublicense under the pfizer patent rights that we have licensed under the pfizer license discussed above 
upon the closing of the inspire license  inspire paid us an upfront license fee of million and is obligated to pay us an additional million upon regulatory approval and the approval of an acceptable label for any subject product by the fda 
the royalty rate will be of net sales in the first two years of commercialization and thereafter 
for five years after the first year of commercial sale  inspire is required to pay us the greater of the running royalty discussed above or certain tiered minimum royalties 
the royalties from inspire are subject to certain reductions  but will in no event fall below a low single digit royalty based on applicable net sales 
we also entered into a trademark license agreement with inspire on february  under which we granted to inspire an exclusive license to the azasite trademark and domain name and a nonexclusive license to the durasite trademark in connection with the commercialization of azasite and other subject products in the territory under the terms of the inspire license 
we also entered into a supply agreement with inspire on february  for the active pharmaceutical ingredient azithromycin 
we had previously entered into a third party supply agreement for the production of such active ingredient 
under the supply agreement  we agreed to supply inspire s requirements of such active ingredient  pursuant to certain forecasting and ordering procedures 
on december   the holders of our senior notes extended the maturity date under such senior notes from december  to february  on february   we redeemed and repaid in full the  in principal and interest due under our senior notes 
such funds were paid from a portion of the upfront license fee we received under the inspire license 
in connection with the redemption and cancellation of our senior notes  all liens on our assets  including our intellectual property  were automatically released and all of our obligations to the holders of the senior notes under the amended and restated security agreement  dated as of december  and the intercreditor and collateral agency agreement  dated as of december  were terminated 
of such senior notes redeemed   in aggregate principal amount was held by our chief executive officer 
we also redeemed and cancelled that certain amended and restated promissory note dated as of december   with an aggregate principal amount of  issued to our vice president  finance and administration 
in february  we announced that preliminary safety data showed that azasite plus was well tolerated 
no serious adverse events were reported 
treatment related ocular adverse events were minimal in frequency and equivalent between the two groups 
there were no significant differences in intraocular pressure between the azasite plus group and placebo group after days of treatment 
reclassifications in  we changed our classification of patent costs to be a selling  general and administrative expense  which had previously been classified as a research and development expense 
this is consistent with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
on research and development costs 
sfas no 
requires that research and development costs exclude legal work in connection with patent applications  litigation and the sale or licensing of patents 
we made the change to better reflect the expenses incurred related to active research and development activities as legal expenses which are more administrative in nature and accordingly should be charged to selling  general and administrative expense 
the impact of this change on our previously reported research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses in the years ended december  and is as follows year ended year ended in thousands december  december  research and development as previously reported reclassification of patent expense research and development selling  general and administrative as previously reported reclassification of patent expense selling  general and administrative critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following policies to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make significant estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are uncertain revenue recognition 
we recognize up front fees from licensing and similar arrangements over the expected term of the related research and development services using the straight line method 
when changes in the expected term of ongoing services are identified  the amortization period for the remaining fees is appropriately modified 
revenue related to performance milestones is recognized when the milestone is achieved based on the terms set forth in the related agreements 
revenue related to contract research services is recognized when the services are provided and collectibility is reasonable assured 
during the year ended  we recognized cost reimbursements as contract and other revenue in accordance with eitf  income statement characterization of reimbursement for out of pocket expenses incurred 
we recognize the received cost sharing payments when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we receive royalties from licensees based on third party sales and the royalties are recorded as earned in accordance with the contract terms  when third party results are reliably measured and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue related to sales of our product  the ocugene glaucoma genetic test  is recognized when all related services have been rendered and collectibility is reasonably assured 
accordingly  revenue for sales of ocugene may be recognized in a later period than the associated recognition of costs of the services provided  especially during the initial launch of the product 
the revenue in connection with the sale of isv to b l was recognized over the contract period 
research and development r d expenses 
r d expenses include salaries  benefits  facility costs  services provided by outside consultants and contractors  administrative costs and materials for our research and development activities 
we also fund research at a variety of academic institutions based on agreements that are generally cancelable 
we recognize such costs as they are incurred 
cost of revenue 
we recognize the cost of inventory shipped and other costs related to our ocugene glaucoma genetic test when they are incurred 
stock based compensation 
our stock based compensation programs consist of stock options granted to employees as well as our employee stock purchase plan  or espp 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r establishes accounting for stock based awards exchanged for employee services 
accordingly  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
all of our stock compensation is accounted for as an equity instrument 
we previously applied accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
inventory 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
the cost of the inventory is based on the first in first out method 
if the cost of the inventory exceeds the expected market value a provision is recorded for the difference between cost and market 
at december   our inventory solely consisted of ocugene kits which are considered finished goods 
results of operations revenues 
we had total net revenues of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  from contract research activities and sales of ocugene 
our revenue in was due to contract research activities conducted for bausch lomb in under the isv asset purchase agreement 
we are no longer providing services to bausch lomb and we do not expect to derive revenue from these activities in or future years 
cost of goods 
our cost of goods of   and  for  and  respectively  reflect the cost of ocugene tests performed as well as the cost of sample collection kits distributed for use 
research and development  net 
net research and development expenses decreased to million in from in costs related to clinical research organizations and the microbiological testing related to our azasite phase clinical trials decreased approximately due to the completion of the trials in january costs related to additional headcount  consultants and temporary labor to assist with the preparation of the azasite nda and to file the azasite plus ind offset these expense decreases 
preclinical costs related to the azasite plus program  the manufacture of the azasite plus phase clinical trial supplies and preparation to manufacture azasite phase clinical units at our contract manufacturing site also partially offset this decrease in external clinical costs in additionally  in we incurred approximately  of non cash expense related to the adoption of fas r and the expensing of options granted to employees and our employee stock purchase plan 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the majority of this increase represents increases in the cost of the clinical research organizations and microbiological testing related to our azasite phase clinical trials 
the remainder of the increase mainly reflects costs related to consultants and temporary labor to assist with the preparation of the azasite nda 
our r d activities can be separated into two major segments  research and clinical development 
research includes activities involved in evaluating a potential product  related pre clinical testing and manufacturing 
clinical development includes activities related to filings with the fda and the related human clinical testing required to obtain marketing approval for a potential product 
we estimate that the following represents the approximate cost of these activities for  and in thousands research clinical development total research and development although the majority of our personnel were focused on our azasite program in  due to our limited personnel and the number of projects that we are developing including our azasite plus program  our personnel are involved in a number of projects at the same time 
accordingly  the majority of our r d expenses are not linked to a specific project but are allocated across projects  based on personnel time expended on each project 
accordingly  the allocated costs may not reflect the actual costs of each project 
the increase in research activities in compared to mainly reflected activities to support the filing of the azasite nda  preparation for commercial manufacture of azasite  preclinical testing to support the azasite plus ind  manufacture of azasite plus phase clinical units and preparation for manufacture of phase azasite plus clinical units at our contract manufacturing site 
the decrease in research activities in compared to mainly reflected the decrease in manufacturing activities as expenses related to the production of clinical supplies for the phase azasite trials were incurred mainly in the decrease in clinical development expenses in as compared to reflects the completion of the azasite phase clinical trials early in the year 
this reduction was partially offset by the increase in headcount  consultants and outside services  primarily in the regulatory departments  to support the preparation and filing of our azasite nda 
additionally  in we filed our azasite plus ind and conducted a phase clinical trial 
the cost of such a trial is significantly less than a phase trial mainly due to the few number of patients included in a phase trial 
the majority of the increase from to is related to our azasite phase clinical trials which were initiated in other than azasite  most of our projects are in the early stages of the product development cycle and may not result in commercial products 
projects in development may not proceed into clinical trials due to a number of reasons even though the project looks promising early in the process 
once a project reaches clinical trials it may be found to be ineffective or there may be harmful side effects 
additionally  during the development cycle  other companies may develop new treatments that decrease the market potential for our project or be issued patents that require us to negotiate a license or cease pursuing one of our products and we may decide not to proceed 
other factors including the cost of manufacturing at a commercial scale and the availability of quality manufacturing capabilities could negatively impact our ability to bring the project to the market 
also  our business strategy is to license projects to third parties to complete the development cycle and to market and sell the product 
if we are unable to enter into collaborative arrangements for any product candidate  our ability to commercialize the product may be slowed or we may decide not to proceed with that candidate 
these collaborative arrangements may either speed the development or they may extend the anticipated time to market 
because of these factors  as well as others  we cannot be certain if  or when  our projects in development will complete the development cycle and be commercialized 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in this increase mainly reflects the amortization of deferred debt issuance costs related to our short term senior secured notes  consulting costs related to compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and approximately  of non cash expense related to the adoption of fas r and the expensing of options granted to directors and employees and our employee stock purchase plan 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in legal expenses increased in mainly due to costs associated with the bristol arbitration which was settled in additionally  in costs were incurred for marketing studies related to the azasite and azasite plus product candidates 
interest expense and other income  net 
interest expense and other income  net was an expense of million   and  in  and  respectively 
the increased expense in mainly reflects accrued interest payable on our short term senior secured notes issued in december and january and the accretion of the value of the debt discount related to the warrants issued as part of the note financing 
the decrease in from mainly reflects the lower average balance of debt outstanding during compared to as we did not close the december tranche of the senior secured notes until december  any interest earned or paid in the future will be dependent on our ability to raise additional funding or execute collaborative or other partnering agreements and prevailing interest rates 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception primarily through private placements and public offerings of debt and equity securities  equipment and leasehold improvement financing  other debt financing and payments from corporate collaborations 
at december   our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents were million 
it is our policy to invest our cash and cash equivalents in highly liquid securities  such as interest bearing money market funds  treasury and federal agency notes and corporate debt 
our auditors have included an explanatory paragraph in their audit report referring to our recurring operating losses and a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
absent additional funding from private or public equity or debt financings  collaborative or other partnering arrangements  including under the inspire license  asset sales  or other sources  we expect that our cash on hand  including cash received from the inspire license in february  a refund of approximately  from the fda related to our azasite nda filing  anticipated cash flow from operations and current cash commitments to us will only be adequate to fund our operations until approximately the end of june if we are unable to secure sufficient additional funding prior to that time  we will need to cease operations and liquidate our assets 
our financial statements were prepared on the assumption that we will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments that might result should we be unable to continue as a going concern 
even if we are able to obtain additional financing in order to continue long term operations beyond approximately the end of june  we will require and will seek additional funding through collaborative or other partnering arrangements  public or private equity or debt financings and from other sources 
however  there can be no assurance that we will obtain interim or longer term financing or that such funding  if obtained  will be sufficient to continue our operations as currently conducted or in a manner necessary for the continued development of our products or the long term success of our company 
if we raise funds through the issuance of debt securities  such debt will likely be secured by a security interest or pledge of all of our assets  will require us to make principal and interest payments  would likely include the issuance of warrants and may subject us to restrictive covenants 
if we raise funds through one or more equity offerings  our stockholders may suffer substantial dilution 
for the years ended december   and  cash used for operating activities was million  million and million  respectively 
cash used in investing activities was   and  primarily related to cash outlays for additions to laboratory and other equipment and a change in restricted cash during and  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million for the years ending december   and  respectively 
in we received net proceeds of million from the exercise of warrants  options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan compared to  and  in and  respectively 
the tables below set forth the amount of cash that we raised for fiscal years through from warrant and option exercises  stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan  equity financings and debt financings 
cash received from warrant and option exercises and employee stock purchase plan year net proceeds million cash received from private placements of equity securities date net proceeds shares of common stock issued august million million plus warrants to purchase million shares may million million plus warrants to purchase million shares march million million plus warrants to purchase million shares cash received from private placement of notes date net proceeds type of notes interest rates and terms maturity date january million short term senior secured notes through july   from july  through february  february  december million short term senior secured notes through june   from july  through february  february  on february   we repaid and redeemed all outstanding principal and interest due under such notes 
in addition to the above  and we repaid  and  respectively  of short term notes payable to directors  members of senior management and other stockholders  which bear interest at rates from to and are due march  we received payments on a note to a stockholder of   and  in  and  respectively 
we also made  and  of payments on capital leases for certain laboratory equipment in and  respectively 
assuming we are able to obtain additional financing and continue our operations  our future capital expenditures and requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the progress of our clinical testing  research and development programs and preclinical testing  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  our ability to successfully commercialize azasite  azasite plus  ocugene and any other products that we may launch in the future  our ability to establish collaborative arrangements  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  changes in our existing collaborative and licensing relationships  acquisition of new businesses  products and technologies  the completion of commercialization activities and arrangements  and the purchase of additional property and equipment 
we anticipate no material capital expenditures to be incurred for environmental compliance in fiscal year based on our environmental compliance record to date  and our belief that we are current in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations  environmental compliance is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in the future periods 
some of these amounts are based on management s estimate and assumptions about these obligations including their duration  the possibility of renewal and other factors 
because these estimates are necessarily subjective  our actual payments in the future may vary from those listed in this table 
payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years capital lease obligations facilities lease obligations purchase obligations licensing agreement obligations notes payable accrued interest total commitments we lease our telephones and telephone equipment under two capital lease agreements  which expire in we lease our facilities under a non cancelable operating lease that expires in purchase obligations include commitments related to clinical development  consulting contracts  equipment maintenance  and other significant purchase commitments 
we have entered into certain license agreements that require us to make minimum royalty payments for the life of the licensed patents 
the life of the patents that may be issued and covered by the license agreements cannot be determined at this time  but the minimum royalties due under such agreements are as noted for through and are approximately  per year 
we repaid these notes in full in february see further discussion of our debt issuances above in liquidity 
we have accrued interest related to our notes payable 
this interest was paid in february when the related notes were repaid in full 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments an amendment of fasb statements no 
and sfas no 

sfas no 
permits an entity to measure at fair value any financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation 
this statement is effective for all financial instruments acquired  issued  or subject to a remeasurement event occurring after the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after september   which is our fiscal year we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december   which is our fiscal year we are currently in the process of evaluating the potential impact of adopting fin on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
 which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
will be effective for fiscal years beginning after november   which is our fiscal year we have not yet evaluated the potential impact of adopting sfas no 
on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits sfas no 

sfas no 
requires employers to recognize on their balance sheet an asset or liability equal to the over or under funded benefit obligation of each defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan and to recognize as a component of other comprehensive income  net of tax  the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost 
amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income  including the gains or losses  prior service costs or credits  and the transition asset or obligation remaining from the initial application of i fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for pensions and ii fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  are adjusted as they are subsequently recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost pursuant to the recognition and amortization provisions of those statements 
this change in balance sheet reporting is effective for fiscal years ending after december  for public companies  which is our fiscal year sfas no 
also eliminates the ability to use an early measurement date  commencing with fiscal years ending after december   which is our fiscal year the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our december  consolidated financial statements 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending on or after november  and addresses how financial statement errors should be considered from a materiality perspective and corrected 
the literature provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
historically there have been two common approaches used to quantify such errors i the rollover approach  which quantifies the error as the amount by which the current year income statement is misstated  and ii the iron curtain approach  which quantifies the error as the cumulative amount by which the current year balance sheet is misstated 
the sec staff believes that companies should quantify errors using both approaches and evaluate whether either of these approaches results in quantifying a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
we adopted the provisions of sab in our fourth fiscal quarter and it had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas creates a fair value option under which an entity may elect to record certain financial assets or liabilities at fair value upon their initial recognition 
subsequent changes in fair value would be recognized in earnings as those changes occur 
the election of the fair value option would be made on a contract by contract basis and would need to be supported by concurrent documentation or a preexisting documented policy 
sfas requires an entity to separately disclose the fair value of these items on the balance sheet or in the footnotes to the financial statements and to provide information that would allow the financial statement user to understand the impact on earnings from changes in the fair value 
sfas is effective for us beginning with fiscal year we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of sfas will have on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
we invest our excess cash in investment grade  interest bearing securities 
at december   we had million invested in interest bearing operating accounts 
while a hypothetical decrease in market interest rates by percent from the december  levels would cause a decrease in interest income  it would not result in a loss of the principal 
additionally  the decrease in interest income would not be material
