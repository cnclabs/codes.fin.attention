during  we acquired inpatient behavioral health care facilities in the acquisition of ardent health services  inc ardent behavioral and one other inpatient facility 
during  we acquired inpatient behavioral health care facilities  including nine inpatient facilities with the acquisition of the capital stock of alternative behavioral services  inc abs on december  we completed the acquisition of one inpatient facility in january on december   we signed a definitive merger agreement to acquire horizon health corporation nasdaq horc horizon health in a transaction valued at million  consisting of cash of per share totaling million and the assumption of horizon health s outstanding debt 
horizon health produced revenues of million for its fiscal year ended august   primarily through the operation and management of inpatient behavioral health care facilities and units 
at november   horizon health owned or leased inpatient facilities with approximately  beds in states 
horizon health also provided services under behavioral health and physical rehabilitation program management contracts with acute care hospitals at november  and operated an employee assistance program services business 
consummation of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions  including regulatory approvals  clearance under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of hart scott rodino act  and approval by horizon health s stockholders 
on february   we received a request for additional information commonly referred to as a second request from the federal trade commission ftc in connection with the pending acquisition 
the second request extends the waiting period imposed by the hart scott rodino act 
the second request relates to two markets 
the companies intend to respond expeditiously to the second request and are working with the ftc to resolve its concerns 
consummation of the transaction is anticipated during the second quarter of we strive to improve the operating results of new and existing inpatient behavioral health care operations by providing the highest quality service  expanding referral networks and marketing initiatives and meeting increased demand for our services by expanding our services and developing new services 
we also attempt to improve operating results by optimizing staffing ratios  controlling contract labor costs and reducing supply costs through group purchasing 
during the year ended december   our same facility revenue from owned and leased inpatient facilities increased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  same facility growth also produced gains in owned and leased inpatient facility patient days and revenue per patient day of and  respectively  during the year ended december  same facility growth refers to the comparison of each inpatient facility owned during with the comparable period in 
table of contents sources of revenue patient service revenue patient service revenue is generated by our inpatient facilities as a result of services provided to patients on an inpatient and outpatient basis within the inpatient behavioral health care facility setting 
patient service revenue is recorded at our established billing rates less contractual adjustments 
generally  collection in full is not expected on our established billing rates 
contractual adjustments are recorded to state our patient service revenue at the amount we expect to collect for the services provided based on amounts reimbursable by medicare or medicaid under provisions of cost or prospective reimbursement formulas or amounts due from other third party payors at contractually determined rates 
for the year ended december   patient service revenue comprised approximately of our total revenue 
management contract and other revenue our inpatient management contract and other segment provides inpatient psychiatric management and development services to hospitals and clinics 
services provided are recorded as management contract revenue in the period the services are provided at contractually determined rates  provided that collectibility of such amounts is reasonably assured 
for the year ended december   management contract and other revenue comprised approximately of our total revenue

as of december   our operating loss carryforwards have been substantially utilized and  as a result  future income tax payments will increase and are expected to move closer to our provision for income taxes 
billings for patient accounts receivable are generally submitted to the payor within three days of the patient s discharge or completion of services 
interim billings may be utilized for patients with extended lengths of stay 
we verify within a reasonable period of time that claims submitted to third party payors have been received and are being processed by such payors 
follow up regarding the status of each claim is made on a periodic basis until payment on the claim is received 
billing notices for self pay accounts receivable are distributed on a periodic basis 
self pay accounts receivable are turned over to collection agencies once internal collection efforts have been exhausted 
accounts receivable under our inpatient management contracts are billed at least monthly 
follow up regarding these amounts is made on a periodic basis until payment is received 
our allowance for doubtful accounts for patient receivables primarily consists of patient accounts which are greater than days past the patient s discharge date 
our allowance for doubtful accounts for receivables due under our inpatient management contracts primarily consists of amounts that are specifically identified as potential collection issues 
accounts receivable are written off when collection within a reasonable period of time is deemed unlikely 
cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was primarily the result of million paid for acquisitions of behavioral health care facilities and million paid for the purchases of fixed assets 
cash used in the acquisition of abs was approximately million  which was financed by borrowings on our revolving credit facility and senior secured term loan facility 
cash used for routine and expansion capital expenditures was approximately million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  we define expansion capital expenditures as those that increase our capacity or otherwise enhance revenue 
routine or maintenance capital expenditures were of our net revenue for the year ended december  cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was primarily the result of million paid for acquisitions of behavioral health care facilities and million paid for the purchases of fixed assets 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  during  we borrowed an additional million under our senior secured term loan facility to finance a portion of the abs acquisition 
also during  we borrowed million on our revolving credit facility primarily to finance acquisitions 
we received approximately million from issuances of our common stock during from stock option exercises 
we have a universal shelf registration statement on form s under which we may sell an indeterminate amount of our common stock  common stock warrants  preferred stock and debt securities 
we may from time to time offer these securities in one or more series  in amounts  at prices and on terms satisfactory to us 
we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
these interest rate swap agreements effectively convert approximately million of fixed rate long term debt to libor indexed variable rate instruments plus agreed upon interest rate spreads ranging from to 
we anticipate financing the acquisition of horizon health through additional borrowings of approximately million under our existing million revolving credit facility  borrowings of million under an additional term loan facility to be established under our existing credit agreement and with cash on hand 
we have entered into a commitment letter with merrill lynch  pierce  fenner smith incorporated  merrill lynch capital corporation and citigroup global markets inc to provide the financing for the additional term loan facility  subject to the terms and conditions of such letter 
we are actively seeking acquisitions that fit our corporate growth strategy and may acquire additional inpatient psychiatric facilities 
management continually assesses our capital needs and  should the need arise  we will seek additional financing  including debt or equity  to fund potential acquisitions or for other corporate purposes 
in negotiating such financing  there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital on terms satisfactory to us 
failure to obtain additional financing on reasonable terms could have a negative effect on our plans to acquire additional inpatient psychiatric facilities

impact of inflation and economic trends although inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations  the health care industry is very labor intensive and salaries and benefits are subject to inflationary pressures as are supply costs  which tend to escalate as vendors pass on the rising costs through price increases 
some of the freestanding owned  leased and managed inpatient behavioral health care facilities we operate are experiencing the effects of the tight labor market  including a shortage of nurses  which has caused and may continue to cause an increase in our swb expense in excess of the inflation rate 
although we cannot predict our ability to cover future cost increases  management believes that through adherence to cost containment policies  labor management and reasonable price increases  the effects of inflation on future operating margins should be manageable 
our ability to pass on increased costs associated with providing health care to medicare and medicaid patients is limited due to various federal  state and local laws which have been enacted that  in certain cases  limit our ability to increase prices 
in addition  as a result of increasing regulatory and competitive pressures and a continuing industry wide shift of patients into managed care plans  our ability to maintain margins through price increases to non medicare patients is limited 
the behavioral health care industry is typically not directly impacted by periods of recession  erosions of consumer confidence or other general economic trends as most health care services are not considered a component of discretionary spending 
however  our inpatient facilities may be indirectly negatively impacted to the extent such economic conditions result in decreased reimbursements by federal or state governments or managed care payors 
we are not aware of any economic trends that would prevent us from being able to remain in compliance with all of our debt covenants and to meet all required obligations and commitments in the near future 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in preparing our financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses included in the financial statements 
estimates are based on historical experience and other information currently available  the results of which form the basis of such estimates 
while we believe our estimation processes are reasonable  actual results could differ from our estimates 
the following represent the estimates considered most critical to our operating performance and involve the most subjective and complex assumptions and assessments 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts our ability to collect outstanding patient receivables from third party payors is critical to our operating performance and cash flows 
the primary collection risk with regard to patient receivables lies with uninsured patient accounts or patient accounts for which primary insurance has paid  but the portion owed by the patient remains outstanding 
we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts primarily based upon the age of the accounts since the patient discharge date 
we continually monitor our accounts receivable balances and utilize cash collection data to support our estimates of the provision for doubtful accounts 
significant changes in payor mix or business office operations could have a significant impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
the primary collection risk with regard to receivables due under our inpatient management contracts is attributable to contractual disputes 
we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts for these receivables based primarily upon the specific identification of potential collection issues 
as with our patient receivables  we continually monitor our accounts receivable balances and utilize cash collection data to support our estimates of the provision for doubtful accounts 
allowances for contractual discounts the medicare and medicaid regulations are complex and various managed care contracts may include multiple reimbursement mechanisms for different types of services provided in our inpatient facilities and cost settlement provisions requiring complex calculations and assumptions subject to interpretation 
we estimate the allowance for contractual discounts on a payor specific basis by comparing our established billing rates with the amount we determine to be reimbursable given our interpretation of the applicable regulations or contract terms 
most payments are determined based on negotiated per diem rates 
while the services authorized and provided and related reimbursement are often subject to interpretation that could result in payments that differ from our estimates  these differences are deemed immaterial 
additionally  updated regulations and contract renegotiations occur frequently necessitating continual review and assessment of the estimation process by our management 
we periodically compare the contractual rates on our patient accounting systems with the medicare and medicaid reimbursement rates or the third party payor contract for accuracy 
we also monitor the adequacy of our contractual adjustments using financial measures such as comparing cash receipts to net patient revenue adjusted for bad debt expense 
as of december   our patient accounts receivable balance for third party payors was million 
a theoretical change in the amounts due from third party payors at december  could have an after tax effect of approximately million on our financial position and results of operations 
the following table presents the percentage by payor of our net revenue and accounts receivable for the years ended december  and in thousands for the year ended december  net accounts net accounts revenue receivable revenue receivable payor mix medicaid commercial hmo private pay medicare state agency other total the following table presents the percentage by aging category of our accounts receivable at december  and in thousands

our consolidated collections as a percentage of net revenue less bad debt expense was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
professional and general liability we are subject to medical malpractice and other lawsuits due to the nature of the services we provide 
at december   all of our operations have professional and general liability insurance in umbrella form for claims in excess of million with an insured limit of million 
the self insured reserves for professional and general liability risks are calculated based on historical claims  demographic factors  industry trends  severity factors  and other actuarial assumptions calculated by an independent third party actuary 
this self insurance reserve is discounted to its present value using a discount rate 
this estimated accrual for professional and general liabilities could be significantly affected should current and future occurrences differ from historical claim trends and expectations 
we have utilized our captive insurance company to manage the self insured retention 
while claims are monitored closely when estimating professional and general liability accruals  the complexity of the claims and wide range of potential outcomes often hampers timely adjustments to the assumptions used in these estimates 
income taxes as part of our process for preparing our consolidated financial statements  our management is required to compute income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the current tax benefit or expense of future deductible and taxable temporary differences 
the future deductible and taxable temporary differences are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities which are components of our balance sheet 
management then assesses our ability to realize the deferred tax assets based on reversals of deferred tax liabilities and  if necessary  estimates of future taxable income 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is established when we believe that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
management must also assess the impact of our acquisitions on the realization of deferred tax assets subject to a valuation allowance to determine if all or a portion of the valuation allowance will be offset by reversing taxable differences or future taxable income of the acquired entity 
to the extent the valuation allowance can be reversed due to the estimated future taxable income of an acquired entity  then our valuation allowance is reduced accordingly as an adjustment to purchase price

fin applies to all tax positions accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  defines the confidence level that a tax position must meet in order to be recognized in the financial statements and requires additional disclosures 
fin is effective for us as of the interim reporting period beginning january  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of fin will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
with respect to our interest bearing liabilities  approximately million of our long term debt outstanding at december  was subject to a weighted average fixed interest rate of  not including our interest rate swaps 
our variable rate debt is comprised of our senior secured term loan facility  which had million outstanding at december  and on which interest is generally payable at libor plus to depending on a certain covenant ratio  and our million revolving credit facility  which had a million balance outstanding at december  and on which interest is generally payable at libor plus to depending on a certain covenant ratio 
at december   we had million in interest rate swaps that effectively changed million of our fixed rate notes to a variable rate 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates would decrease our net income and cash flows by approximately million on an annual basis based upon our borrowing level at december  in the event we draw on our revolving credit facility and interest rates change significantly  we expect management would take actions intended to further mitigate our exposure to such change
