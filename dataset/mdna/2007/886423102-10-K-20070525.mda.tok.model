executive summary and overview the company provides services and equipment to the global offshore energy industry through the operation of a diversified fleet of marine service vessels 
revenues  net earnings and cash flows from operations are dependent upon the activity level of the vessel fleet that is ultimately dependent upon oil and natural gas prices that  in turn  are determined by the supply demand relationship for oil and natural gas 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
strong industry fundamentals during fiscal improved the company s operating performance above fiscal levels as fiscal revenues exceeded the one billion dollar mark for only the second time in the year history of the company 
the company recorded billion in revenues during fiscal  an increase of approximately million  or  over the revenue amounts reported during fiscal net earnings rose approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal the company s international operations continue to provide the most significant contribution to earnings and  during fiscal  revenues generated from international operations as a percentage of the company s total revenues were 
the company s international results of operations are primarily dependent on the demand and supply relationship for crude oil 
during fiscal  international based revenues and operating profit increased approximately million and million  or and  respectively  as compared to fiscal due to strong worldwide demand for oil and gas and an improved operating environment which resulted in an escalation of vessel dayrates 
higher fiscal international based vessel revenues were partially offset by higher operating costs and depreciation expense 
fiscal s international based operating costs 
table of contents 
index to financial statements increased approximately from fiscal levels due primarily to higher crewing costs and repair and maintenance costs 
the company s united states results of operations are primarily dependent on the demand and supply relationship for natural gas 
the company s us based revenues and operating profit increased approximately million and million  or and  respectively  during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to higher average day rates on all vessel classes operating in the us market 
average day rates were propelled by strong demand for offshore supply vessels during calendar years through due to high demand associated with the continuation of repair work to the offshore energy infrastructure that was damaged by hurricane ivan in calendar year and due to the extensive damage caused to the energy infrastructure in the oil producing areas of the us gulf coast by hurricanes katrina and rita in late august and september the offshore vessel market tightened as exploration and production e p companies competed to find available vessels for the necessary repair work resulting from the damage caused by the storms which propelled charter rates past levels achieved in the and industry upturns 
as the necessary repair work in the us gulf of mexico nears completion  the number of available drilling rigs in the us market should be the primary driver of the company s future profitability in the us market 
the strength of the international drilling market has attracted offshore rigs from the us market over the past few years 
over the longer term  the company s us based fleet should be influenced more by the active gulf of mexico rig count than by any other single outside influence  although the number of available vessels of competitor companies will also have a significant effect 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company entered into a definitive agreement with crosby marine transportation  llc to sell of its offshore tugs  of which operated in the united states and two operated internationally 
the sale of of the tugs closed in the company s second quarter of fiscal for a total cash price of million 
the sale of the other three tugs closed during the third quarter of fiscal for a total sales price of million 
the culmination of the entire transaction resulted in an approximate million pre tax financial gain during fiscal  or approximately million after tax per diluted common share after tax 
the company also sold and or scrapped an additional vessels which resulted in additional gains on sales of assets of approximately million during fiscal fiscal witnessed the delivery of eight newly constructed vessels  which consisted of five anchor handling towing supply vessels  one platform supply vessel and two crewboats 
the newly built anchor handlers and the platform supply vessels expanded the company s core vessel fleet 
to date  the company has funded all of its vessel commitment programs from current cash balances  operating cash flow  and funds provided by its million senior unsecured notes and its revolving credit facility 
key focus for fiscal and outlook during fiscal  the company continued its focus on growing its international markets  improving its domestic profitability  and regenerating its vessel fleet in order to generate future earnings capacity 
the company is effectively utilizing its strong cash position to grow the industry s largest new fleet of vessels and also fund common stock repurchases when appropriate 
in the company s operating business  management focused on improving dayrates and utilization  maintaining disciplined cost control in the sourcing of critical supplies and services  and continuing to improve its industry leading safety record 
fiscal was a year of strong financial performance with solid improvements in revenue  operating profit and earnings per share  all building the foundation for long term growth 
given the progress the company has made in executing its strategies  the company is poised to continue to grow organically and  given the right opportunity  to grow through targeted and disciplined acquisitions 
the company will continue to pursue its long term growth strategies on a disciplined basis 
the company has targeted two additional dimensions within its strategic initiatives to include assessing opportunities for its older fleet  and targeted acquisitions 
in each case  the company will carefully consider whether proposed transactions have the appropriate risk reward profile 
these areas of opportunity have a common

the majority of the company s core group of older vessels  its supply and towing supply vessels  were constructed between and as such  most of this vessel class exceeds years of age and may be replaced within the next several years depending on the strength of the market during this time frame 
in addition to age  market conditions also help determine when a vessel is no longer economically viable 
the company anticipates using future operating cash flows  existing borrowing capacities or new borrowings or lease arrangements to fund over the next few years the continuing replacement of the company s mature fleet of vessels 
these vessels would replace the company s aging vessels in the core international fleet with fewer  larger and more efficient vessels 
the company believes that adequate capital resources and liquidity will be available to fund the continuation of fleet replacement

the company s revenues and operating profit are primarily driven by fleet size  vessel utilization and day rates because operating costs and depreciation do not change proportionally with changes in revenue 
operating costs primarily consist of crew costs  repair and maintenance  insurance  fuel  lube oil and supplies 
fleet size and utilization are the major factors which affect crew costs 
the timing and amount of repair and maintenance costs are influenced by customer demands  vessel age and scheduled drydockings to satisfy safety and inspection requirements mandated by regulatory agencies 
drydocking costs are only incurred if economically justified  taking into consideration the vessel s age  physical condition and future expected marketability 
if the required drydocking is not performed  the vessel is either stacked or sold as it cannot work without the proper certifications

comparison of fiscal to fiscal fiscal market conditions strong industry fundamentals improved the company s operating performance above fiscal levels as fiscal revenues exceeded the one billion dollar mark for only the second time in the year history of the company 
the company recorded billion in revenues during fiscal  an increase of approximately million  or  over the revenue amounts reported during fiscal net earnings rose approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal a significant portion of the company s operations are conducted internationally 
during fiscal  revenues generated from international operations as a percentage of the company s total revenues were

table of contents 
index to financial statements higher average day rates and utilization on all vessel classes operating internationally are the cause of the strength of the company s international based results of operations during fiscal average day rates for the total international based fleet increased approximately during fiscal as compared to fiscal while utilization for the entire international based fleet increased approximately during the same comparative period 
the company s international results of operations have been primarily dependent on the supply and demand relationship for crude oil 
crude oil prices were quite volatile during fiscal but remained in a range of prices that were consistently attractive to the e p companies 
by the end of march  crude oil prices were in the low s after reaching an all time closing high of in mid july due to the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec commitment to maintain the price floor by deciding in november to cut oil production by one million barrels per day 
analysts forecast that global demand for crude oil will likely remain strong throughout calendar year and expect future crude oil prices to remain at attractive levels due to high worldwide consumer demand for oil  relatively low excess opec production capacity  opec s intention to defend a specific floor price for crude oil and continued concerns over possible supply interruptions caused by geopolitical risk in certain countries that are members of opec 
management anticipates international vessel demand will remain strong as long as crude oil prices remain at levels whereby e p companies would continue to expend their anticipated e p spending budgets  which are at levels that exceed actual expenditures 
higher utilization and average day rates are also the basis of the company s improved us results of operations during fiscal as compared to fiscal average day rates increased on all vessel classes operating in the us market 
total average day rates on the entire us based fleet increased approximately during fiscal as compared to fiscal  while utilization for the total us based fleet increased approximately during the same comparative period 
fiscal s strong financial performance is a result of several significant improvements that occurred in the offshore support vessel market in previous years 
during the first half of calendar year  the market for offshore support vessels improved as a result of the tightening of the supply of offshore support vessels due to high demand associated with the continuation of repair work to the offshore energy infrastructure that was damaged by hurricane ivan in calendar year hurricanes katrina and rita  which caused extensive damage to the energy industry infrastructure in the oil producing areas of the us gulf coast in late august and september  respectively  further tightened the offshore vessel market as e p companies competed to find available vessels for the necessary repair work resulting from the damage caused by the two storms 
demand for the company s vessels in the gulf of mexico prior to the two storms had already strengthened and business after the storms propelled charter rates past levels achieved in the and industry upturns 
however  consistent with public reports  the company has seen some softening in the shallow water offshore vessel market as the needed infrastructure repair work slows and as numerous drilling rigs begin to relocate to international areas 
with completion of the needed repair work in the us gulf of mexico  the number of available drilling rigs in the us market should be the primary driver of the company s future profitability in the us market and  at present time  the offshore rig count in the gulf of mexico remains relatively depressed as compared to past up cycles 
in addition  the strength of the international drilling market has attracted offshore rigs from the us market over the past few years and this trend is expected to continue in the upcoming quarters 
over the longer term  the company s us based fleet should be influenced more by the active offshore rig count than by any other single outside influence 
industry reports indicate that over the next three years the worldwide moveable drilling rig count will increase as new build rigs currently on order and under construction stand at approximately rigs to supplement the current approximately movable rigs worldwide 
analysts have reported that the majority of the new jackups being delivered in calendar year will work in the international markets 
commodity prices for crude oil and natural gas are critical factors in e p companies decision to retain their drilling rigs in the us gulf of mexico market or mobilize the rigs to profitable international markets 
natural gas prices were relatively weak during calendar year as inventory levels exceeded five year averages due to mild weather 
by mid calendar year  natural gas inventories exceeded the five year average by as reported by the department of energy and were well on their way to maximum storage capacity by the end of the summer which helped drive natural gas prices below per mcf 
natural gas prices have strengthened since calendar year began as demand for natural gas increased due to late winter cold temperatures in the northern hemisphere which reduced inventories to normalized levels 
the company s us results of operations are primarily driven by natural gas exploration and production and  given the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements relative volatility and uncertainty in natural gas pricing in the near term  it is unknown how us based vessel demand will be affected 
certain industry analysts forecast near term weakness in the natural gas market but expect solid results in the latter portion of calendar year as excess inventory levels dissipate 
while these factors lead to questions about the immediate future activity level of the us market  the company s assets are highly mobile and should the us market soften  the company has the ability to redeploy its vessels to international markets where the vessels may benefit from strong average day rates and earnings are taxed at statutory income tax rates that are typically lower than in the united states 
in reaction to rigs departing the gulf of mexico during the latter part of calendar year  the company relocated vessels to international areas during fiscal where the vessels were contracted for more attractive term work at effectively more profitable dayrates than what the vessels were achieving in the gulf of mexico 
the company will continue to assess the demand for vessels in the gulf and consider relocating additional vessels to stronger international areas as necessary 
united states based operations us based vessel revenues increased  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to higher average day rates and utilization 
the company s deepwater class of vessels contributed approximately of revenue growth during fiscal as compared to fiscal towing supply supply vessels  the company s most significant income producing vessel class in the us market  generated approximately of the revenue growth during the same comparative periods 
revenues on the company s crew utility class of vessels during fiscal decreased by as compared to fiscal  due to fewer crew utility vessels operating in the us market resulting from tidewater s sale of crewboats during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company s offshore tug class of vessels also had a reduction in revenues during fiscal of approximately compared to fiscal due to the sale of the company s offshore tugs that operated in the us market 
average day rates on the us based towing supply supply vessels increased approximately during fiscal as compared to fiscal  while utilization rates on this same class of vessel decreased a modest during fiscal as compared to fiscal average day rates on the company s us based deepwater class of vessels increased approximately during fiscal as compared to fiscal during fiscal  utilization rates on the deepwater class of vessels decreased a modest as compared to fiscal during fiscal  average day rates for the crew utility class of vessels increased approximately as compared to fiscal while utilization rates on the same class of vessel increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal us based operating profit increased approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to higher revenues which were partially offset by a increase in vessel operating costs primarily crew cost and repair and maintenance costs and a increase in depreciation expense 
increases in crew costs are primarily due to wage pressures while increases in repair and maintenance costs resulted from higher shipyard pricing combined with necessary repairs work needed on an aging fleet 
international based operations international based vessel revenues increased approximately  or million  for fiscal as compared to fiscal due to an increase in utilization and average day rates on all classes of vessels operating in the international market

international crew costs increased primarily because the newer  technically sophisticated anchor handling towing supply vessels and platform supply vessels that have been added to the fleet generally require a greater number of specially trained fleet personnel than the older smaller vessels in the fleet 
these same vessels incur higher maintenance costs as a result of the increased complexity and sophistication of the newer equipment installed on the vessels 
in addition  crew costs increased due to worldwide wage pressures on all crew staff positions 
repair and maintenance costs also increased during the comparative periods because of necessary repair work needed on an aging fleet combined with higher shipyard pricing 
fuel costs increased due to higher per gallon price for fuel and more vessel mobilizations during fiscal as compared to fiscal brokers commissions increased due to increases in revenues 
other items due to an improved safety record and lower claim costs and loss reserves  the company s insurance and loss reserve costs decreased approximately during fiscal as compared to fiscal the company performed a thorough review of all the vessel classes in its fleet for asset impairment during the third quarter of fiscal the review resulted in no impairment charge 
during fiscal  the company s review of asset impairment resulted in an impairment charge of million on eight vessels in the company s fleet 
the eight vessels were written down to each vessel s respective estimated fair value 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company entered into a definitive agreement with crosby marine transportation  llc to sell of its offshore tugs  of which operated in the united states and two operated internationally 
the sale of of the tugs closed in the company s second quarter of fiscal for a total cash price of million 
the sale of the other three tugs closed during the third quarter of fiscal for a total sales price of million 
the culmination of the entire transaction resulted in an approximate million pre tax financial gain during fiscal  or approximately million after tax per diluted common share after tax 
gain on sales of assets during fiscal is approximately lower than during fiscal primarily due to the july sale of six kmar class of anchor handling towing supply vessels to deep sea supply asa for a total cash price of million which resulted in a million pre tax financial gain 
interest and miscellaneous income increased approximately  or million  as compared to fiscal because the company had higher levels of cash invested in short term  interest bearing securities during fiscal than in fiscal comparison of fiscal to fiscal fiscal market conditions fiscal us results of operations benefited from strong industry fundamentals which translated into higher utilization and average day rates for the company s us based vessel fleet 
prospects for growth in the offshore market in the us gulf of mexico showed significant improvement from the previous fiscal year 
however  hurricanes katrina and rita caused extensive damage to the energy industry infrastructure in the gulf of mexico and along the us gulf coast resulting in an interruption in oil and gas production in the gulf of mexico 
the us minerals management service mms statistical report on production shut ins due to hurricanes katrina and rita dated march  reported that total shut in oil production  for the period of september  to march   totaled approximately of the yearly us gulf oil production

index to financial statements during this same period of time  natural gas shut in totaled approximately of the yearly us gulf gas production as reported by mms 
pre storm offshore rig demand improved greatly and drilling activity was forecast to remain at improved levels well into calendar the e p companies contracted offshore drilling rigs for longer durations than in past periods due to concerns over rig availability in the us market 
the market for offshore support vessels tightened as drilling operators discovered that offshore vessels that were in service were in short supply 
the us gulf of mexico supply boat market still had a significant number of vessels stacked that could resume active status  but only after expenditures to drydock to re certify the vessels 
the company did not experience any injuries to its personnel or damage or interruption of service to its fleet of vessels serving the offshore oil and gas industry in the gulf of mexico due to hurricanes katrina and rita 
the aftermath of the storms did not have any material impact on the company s ability to respond to customer needs or its ability to fulfill contract commitments 
demand for the company s available us based vessels prior to the two storms was strong and business after the storms propelled charter rates past levels achieved in the and industry upturns 
us based results of operations are primarily driven by natural gas exploration and production and  given the damage sustained to the offshore oil and gas infrastructure  the company s vessels were in high demand in the gulf of mexico while repairs were made to offshore pipelines and platforms 
the repair work in the gulf of mexico kept us based vessel demand high for the near term  but the offshore rig count in the gulf of mexico remained relatively depressed as compared to past up cycles 
the uptick in us based business during the second half of fiscal was related to the repair work resulting from damage caused by hurricanes katrina and rita 
after the completion of the needed repair work in the us gulf of mexico  the number of available drilling rigs in the us market became the primary driver of the company s future profitability in the us market 
the strength of the international drilling market attracted offshore rigs from the us market over the past few years 
this capacity constraint forced some e p companies to delay drilling programs 
over the longer term  the company s us based fleet will be influenced more by the active offshore rig count than by any other single outside influence 
fiscal analysts reports indicated that the offshore drilling rig count would increase as the new build order books for jackup rigs stood at approximately rigs 
nine of these rigs were scheduled for delivery in calendar while calendar years  and were expected to have  and rig deliveries  respectively 
the company s fiscal international results of operations benefited from higher average day rates  utilization and an increase in the number of vessels operating internationally 
improvements in the company s average day rates and utilization were due to increases in international e p spending and an increase in rig utilization in the international arena 
industry analysts forecast that demand for crude oil would remain strong throughout calendar year due to high crude oil prices due to strong domestic and international demand  tight crude oil inventory supplies and continued concerns over possible supply interruptions caused by geopolitical risk in certain countries that are members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec 
during fiscal  analysts forecast that calendar year e p spending in the international markets would increase by approximately from amounts spent in calendar management anticipated international vessel demand would continue to improve along with the strong market conditions  although management believed that demand would be limited by the availability of drilling and production units to serve the industry 
there were also a number of vessels under construction in the industry that will enter into service in the upcoming years that would increase the available supply of vessels to satisfy customer demands 
the company s properties and equipment were unaffected by hurricanes katrina and rita  which affected the gulf coast region of the united states 
the company s fleet of vessels operating in the gulf of mexico did not sustain any damage and the company s main operational base in amelia  louisiana suffered only power and telephone outages 
the company s corporate headquarters located in new orleans  louisiana did not sustain damage but was inaccessible for business for approximately three months

the company s international deepwater class  towing supply supply class and crew utility class of vessels generated approximately  and  respectively  of the revenue growth during fiscal as compared to fiscal the company s offshore tugs and other classes of vessels also made positive contributions to fiscal s revenue growth  each contributing approximately and  respectively  to the increase in revenues earned 
revenues also improved due to an increase in total utilization of the international based fleet which increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal international based vessel operating profit increased  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to higher revenues 
higher revenues were partially offset by increases in crew costs resulting from an increase of vessels operating in the international market and due to additional united kingdom multi employer retirement fund expenses and depreciation expense resulting from an increase in the number of vessels operating in the international market 
increased depreciation expense was a result of adding newly built vessels to the company s fleet of vessels 
other items during the first quarter of fiscal  the company performed a thorough review of all vessels withdrawn from service and stacked vessels in the company s fleet and during the third quarter of fiscal  the company performed a thorough review of all vessels in its fleet for asset impairment 
the reviews resulted in a december impairment charge of million on eight vessels withdrawn from service 
the eight vessels were written down to each vessel s respective estimated fair value 
an impairment charge of million was recorded in fiscal to reduce the carrying amount of stacked vessels that were unlikely to return to active service

fiscal gain on sales of assets increased significantly as compared to fiscal due primarily to the july  sale of six kmar class of anchor handling towing supply vessels to deep sea supply asa for a total cash price of million

the company also sold and or scrapped an additional vessels which resulted in additional gains on sales of assets of approximately million during fiscal vessel class statistics vessel utilization is determined primarily by market conditions and to a lesser extent by drydocking requirements 
vessel day rates are determined by the demand created through the level of offshore exploration  development and production spending by energy companies relative to the supply of offshore service vessels 
suitability of equipment and the degree of service provided also influence vessel day rates 
vessel utilization rates are calculated by dividing the number of days a vessel works during a reporting period by the number of days the vessel is available to work in the reporting period 
average day rates are calculated by dividing the revenue a vessel earns during a reporting period by the number of days the vessel worked in the reporting period 
vessel utilization and average day rates are calculated only on vessels in service and  as such  do not include vessel withdrawn from service or joint venture vessels

the majority of the company s core group of older vessels  its supply and towing supply vessels  were constructed between and as such  most of this vessel class exceeds years of age and may be replaced within the next several years depending on the strength of the market during this time frame 
in addition to age  market conditions also help determine when a vessel is no longer economically viable 
the company anticipates using future operating cash flows  existing borrowing capacities or new borrowings or lease arrangements to fund over the next few years the continuing replacement of the company s mature fleet of vessels 
these vessels would replace the company s aging vessels in the core international fleet with fewer  larger and more efficient vessels 
the company believes that adequate capital resources and liquidity will be available to fund the continuation of fleet replacement

certain current and former subsidiaries of the company are  or have been  participating employers in an industry wide multi employer retirement fund in the united kingdom  the merchant navy officers pension fund mnopf 
the company has been informed of an estimated million sterling  or approximately million  total fund deficit as estimated by the mnopf actuary that will require contributions from the participating employers 
substantially all of the fund s deficit allocable to the company relates to current operating subsidiaries as the company does not believe  on the advice of counsel  that it is liable for any additional portion of the fund s deficit that relates to subsidiaries that have either been sold or dissolved in prior years 
the amount of the company s share of the fund s deficit will depend ultimately on a number of factors including an updated calculation of the total fund deficit  the number of participating employers  and the final method used in allocating the required contribution among participating employers 
in august  the company received an invoice from the fund in the amount of million for what the trustees calculated to be the company s then current share of the fund deficit 
accordingly  the company recorded this amount in full as crew cost expense during the second quarter of fiscal as allowed by the terms of the assessment  approximately million of the invoiced amount was paid during fiscal with the remainder  including interest charges  to be paid in annual installments over nine years 
the annual installment payments are paid in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and  as such  million was paid during the quarter ended march  in february  the company received notification of an additional assessment for a shortfall in the original deficit in the amount of million sterling  or approximately million 
the company recorded the full amount of the additional assessment in crew costs expense during the fourth quarter of fiscal according to the terms of the agreement  the company will pay the increase in eight equal installments including interest charges  beginning march in march  the company provided an additional million due to the finalization of the pension fund s actuarial evaluation 
the first installment on the additional million is due in september it is possible that in the future the fund s trustee may claim that the company owes additional amounts for various reasons  including the results of future fund valuation reports and whether other assessed parties have the financial capability to contribute their respective allocations 
the company has been made a defendant in several lawsuits in various areas of the world where its marine vessel operations are conducted  including a recent filing of a class action styled suit in california  alleging certain labor and wage and hour law violations claimed by certain current and former employees 
the amount  if any  of all such claims for which the company ultimately may be held liable is not presently capable of being determined or estimated based on the current status of the claims and the information available to the company 
the company is in the process of defending against these claims and  in management s opinion  the ultimate outcome of these matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or its results of operations 
in april  the company announced that it was conducting an internal investigation of its nigerian operations  focusing on the legality  under the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and local laws  of its nigerian affiliate s reimbursement of certain expenses incurred by a customs agent in connection with the temporary importation of its vessels into nigeria  particularly the obtaining of certain permits that are necessary for the company s vessels to operate in nigerian offshore waters 
the company further announced that the audit committee of the company s board of directors had engaged the law firm of steptoe johnson of washington  dc  a leading international law firm with significant experience in investigating and advising upon fcpa matters  to lead the investigation 
the audit committee commissioned the internal investigation in late february after management brought to its attention a settlement earlier that month of well publicized criminal fcpa proceedings the second in recent years involving vetco gray controls  a houston based oil service company with substantial operations in nigeria 
tidewater s management and the audit committee were concerned that 
table of contents 
index to financial statements the company s nigerian affiliate used the same third party agent to process its temporary importation permits in nigeria that was thought to be significantly implicated in the vetco gray proceedings 
given that the company uses the same third party agent in other countries where its vessel are deployed  the audit committee also commissioned special counsel to assess the company s compliance with the fcpa in those selected other countries 
although the internal investigation is ongoing  enough progress has been made and reported to the audit committee by special counsel for the company to conclude that certain changes to its fcpa compliance program would provide the company greater assurance that its assets are not used  directly  or through an intermediary  to make improper payments  including in the areas of customs and immigration  and to also assure that the company is in compliance with the fcpa s record keeping requirements 
although the company has had a long term published policy requiring compliance with the fcpa  and broadly prohibiting any improper payments by the company to foreign or domestic officials  the company is in the process of adopting intermediate measures intended to minimize the possibility of fcpa violations while the internal investigation is ongoing  although additional measures may be required once the final report has been rendered to the audit committee 
the company has voluntarily contacted the securities and exchange commission and the united states department of justice to advise both agencies that an internal investigation is underway and that it will cooperate fully with both agencies 
the company is unable to predict whether either agency will open a proceeding to separately investigate this matter  or  if a proceeding is opened  what potential remedies  if any  these agencies may seek 
in addition  although management will seek to avoid material disruption to its nigerian operations  the company cannot gauge at this time the long term effects of implementing the necessary corrective measures on its business in nigeria 
based on the information obtained to date in the investigation  the company does not believe that any potential liability that may result is either probable or reasonably estimable  and  thus  no accrual has been recorded as of march  should additional information be obtained the company will record a provision when the amount is both probable and reasonably estimable 
various legal proceedings and claims are outstanding which arose in the ordinary course of business

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk see note to notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for a more complete discussion of this transaction 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect both the recorded values of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the revenues recognized and expenses incurred during the reporting period 
the company s estimates and assumptions affect its recognition of deferred expenses  bad debts  income taxes  the carrying value of its long lived assets and goodwill  and its provision for certain contingencies 
the company evaluates the reasonableness of these estimates and assumptions continually based on a combination of historical information and other information that comes to its attention that may vary its outlook for the future 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions 
management suggests that the company s summary of significant accounting policies  as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  be read in conjunction with this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company believes the critical accounting policies that most impact the company s consolidated financial statements are described below 
revenue recognition 
the company s primary source of revenue is derived from time charter contracts of its vessels on a rate per day of service basis 
these time charter contracts are generally either on a term basis average three months to two years or on a spot basis 
the base rate of hire for a term contract is generally a fixed rate  provided  however  that term contracts at times include escalation clauses to recover increases in specific costs 
a spot contract is a short term agreement to provide offshore marine services to a customer for a specific short term job 
spot contract terms generally range from one day to three months 
marine vessel revenues are recognized on a daily basis throughout the contract period 
receivables 
in the normal course of business  the company extends credit to its customers on a short term basis 
the company s principal customers are major oil and natural gas exploration  development and production companies 
although credit risks associated with our customers are considered minimal  the company routinely reviews its accounts receivable balances and makes adequate provisions for doubtful accounts 
goodwill 
the company tests goodwill impairment annually at a reporting unit level  as required  using carrying amounts as of december the company considers its reporting units to be its domestic and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements international operations 
the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is determined by discounting the projected future operating cash flows for the remaining average useful life of the assets within the reporting units by the company s related weighted average cost of capital 
impairment is deemed to exist if the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is less than the respective book value of the reporting unit goodwill  and in such case  an impairment loss would be recognized equal to the difference 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit  such as  future expected utilization and average day rates for the vessels  vessel additions and attrition  operating expenses and tax rates 
although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result 
the company performed its annual impairment test as of december   and the test determined there was no goodwill impairment 
at march   the company s goodwill balance represented of total assets and of stockholders equity 
interim testing will be performed if events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired 
examples of events or circumstances that might give rise to interim goodwill impairment testing include significant adverse industry or economic changes  significant business interruption due to political unrest or terrorism  unanticipated competition that has the potential to dramatically reduce the company s earning potential  legal issues  or the loss of key personnel 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events occur or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable 
in such evaluation  the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated by an asset group are compared with the carrying amount of the asset group to determine if a write down may be required 
the company estimates cash flows based upon historical data adjusted for the company s best estimate of future market performance that is based on industry trends 
if impairment exists  the carrying value of the asset group is reduced to its estimated fair value 
vessels with similar operating and marketing characteristics are grouped for asset impairment testing 
although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce materially different results 
management estimates may vary considerably from actual outcomes due to future adverse market conditions or poor operating results that could result in the inability to recover the current carrying value of an asset group  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
as the company s fleet continues to age  management closely monitors the estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis to properly identify evolving trends and changes in market conditions that could impact the results of the impairment evaluation 
during fiscal  the company refined its asset groupings and its testing methodology to increase the number of asset groups and better reflect the composition of its fleet and the markets within which it currently operates 
in addition to the periodic review of long lived assets for impairment when circumstances warrant  the company also performs a review of its stacked vessels and vessels withdrawn from service every six months 
this review considers items such as the vessel s age  length of time stacked and likelihood of a return to active service  among others 
the company records an impairment charge when the carrying value of a vessel withdrawn from service or stacked vessel that is unlikely to return to service exceeds its estimated fair value 
no impairment was recorded in fiscal during fiscal and  million and million impairment charge was recorded  respectively 
income taxes 
the company determines its effective tax rate by estimating its permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
the company is periodically audited by taxing authorities in the united states and by the respective tax agencies in the countries in which we operate internationally 
the tax audits generally include questions regarding the calculation of taxable income 
audit adjustments affecting permanent differences could have an impact on the company s effective tax rate 
the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets is based on the company s present belief that it is more likely than not that it will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to utilize such deferred tax assets  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record or adjust valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the company s 
table of contents 
index to financial statements consolidated statement of operations 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and assesses the need for changes to valuation allowances quarterly 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the present need for a valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
drydocking costs 
the company expenses maintenance and repair costs as incurred during the asset s original estimated useful life its original depreciable life 
major repair costs incurred after the original depreciable life that also has the effect of extending the useful life of the asset are capitalized and amortized over months 
major vessel modifications are capitalized and amortized over the remaining life of the equipment 
vessel modifications that are performed for a specific customer contract are capitalized and amortized over the firm contract term 
the majority of the company s vessels require a drydocking inspection twice in each five year period and the company schedules these drydockings when it is anticipated that the work can be performed 
the company s net earnings can fluctuate quarter to quarter due to the timing of scheduled drydockings 
accrued property and liability losses 
the company self insures potential hull damage and personal injury claims that may arise in the normal course of business 
the company is exposed to insurance risks related to the company s reinsurance contracts with various insurance entities 
the reinsurance recoverable amount can vary depending on the size of a loss 
the exact amount of the reinsurance recoverable is not known until all losses are settled 
the company estimates the reinsurance recoverable amount it expects to receive and also estimates losses for claims that have occurred but have not been reported or not fully developed 
the company also monitors its reinsurance recoverable balances regularly for possible reinsurance exposure and makes adequate provisions for doubtful reinsurance receivables 
it is the company s opinion that its accounts and reinsurance receivables have no impairment other than that for which provisions have been made 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
the company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan and a supplemental executive retirement plan covering eligible employees of tidewater inc and participating subsidiaries 
the company also sponsors a defined contribution retirement plan that covers eligible us fleet personnel and eligible employees of the company hired after december  and a post retirement plan for qualified retired employees 
net periodic pension costs and accumulated benefit obligations are determined using a number of assumptions including the discount rate  the rate of compensation increases  retirement ages  mortality rates and expected long term return on plan assets 
these assumptions have a significant impact on the amounts reported 
the company s pension cost consists of service costs  interest costs  amortization of prior service costs or benefits  expected returns on plan assets and  in part  on a market related valuation of assets 
the company considers a number of factors in developing its pension assumptions  including an evaluation of relevant discount rates  expected long term returns on plan assets  plan asset allocations  expected changes in wages and retirement benefits  analyses of current market conditions and input from actuaries and other consultants 
the company also provides postretirement benefits to qualified retired employees 
the postretirement program provides limited health care and life insurance benefits 
costs of the program are based on actuarially determined amounts and are accrued over the period from the date of hire to the full eligibility date of employees who are expected to qualify for these benefits

effects of inflation day to day operating costs are generally affected by inflation 
however  because the energy services industry requires specialized goods and services  general economic inflationary trends may not affect the company s operating costs 
the major impact on operating costs is the level of offshore exploration  development and production spending by energy exploration and production companies 
as the spending increases  prices of goods and services used by the energy industry and the energy services industry will increase 
future increases in vessel day rates may shield the company from the inflationary effects on operating costs

although prices moderated some in calendar year  the price of steel remains high by historical standards
