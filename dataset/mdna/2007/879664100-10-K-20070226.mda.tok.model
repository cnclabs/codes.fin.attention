quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk investments in marketable securities during the normal course of business  we invest a portion of our cash and cash equivalents in marketable securities 
for a discussion of our investments in marketable securities for the fiscal years ended december  and december   see the notes to our consolidated financial statements in our annual report  included herein as exhibit  and incorporated herein by reference 
financial instruments and market risk we conduct business on a global basis in us and foreign currencies  so our financial results are subject to risks associated with fluctuating foreign exchange rates 
to mitigate these risks  we have a foreign currency exposure management program which uses derivative foreign exchange contracts to address nonfunctional currency exposures that are expected to be settled in one year or less 
we enter into derivative foreign exchange contracts only to the extent necessary to meet our goal of mitigating nonfunctional foreign currency exposures 
we do not enter into hedging transactions for speculative purposes 
the derivative foreign exchange contracts consist primarily of foreign currency forward contracts 

table of contents derivative financial instruments involve elements of market and credit risk not recognized in the financial statements 
the market risk that results from these instruments relates to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which generally are offset by changes in the value of the underlying assets or liabilities being held 
credit risk relates to the risk of nonperformance by a counterparty to one of our derivative contracts 
we do not believe there is a significant credit risk associated with our hedging activities because the counterparties are all large international financial institutions with high credit ratings 
in addition  we also limit the aggregate notional amount of agreements entered into with any one financial institution to mitigate credit risk 
non designated hedges we use derivative contracts to manage overall foreign currency exposures that are remeasured through income 
we record these contracts on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the fair value of these contracts are included in earnings as part of other expense  net 
we had a net gain of million in  a net loss of million in and a net gain of million in receivables resulting from the contracts are included in miscellaneous receivables and other current assets  while payables from the contracts are included as part of other accrued liabilities 
we do not engage in hedging specific individual transactions 
cash flow hedges we use derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges to mitigate currency risk related to an imbalance of nonfunctional currency denominated costs and related revenue 
we conducted quarterly effectiveness tests on a spot to spot basis excluding time value  with the time value portion recorded in other expense  net 
we reclassified the effective gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income to operating expenses when the hedged transaction was recognized in earnings 
we recorded any ineffectiveness of the forward contracts in other expense  net 
the impact to earnings associated with hedge ineffectiveness from cash flow hedges was negligible for when it becomes probable that an anticipated transaction  which is hedged  will not occur  we immediately reclassify the gains or losses related to that hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income to other expense  net 
at year end  we had a balance of million remaining in accumulated other comprehensive income 
we did not hold any derivatives designated as cash flow hedges at year end 
our net foreign currency exposure is diversified among a broad number of currencies
