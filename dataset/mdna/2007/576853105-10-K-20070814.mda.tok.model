item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
gaap represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and requirements  the application of which requires management judgments and estimates including  in certain circumstances  choices between acceptable gaap alternatives 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  if any  at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  contains a comprehensive summary of our significant accounting policies 
the following is a discussion of our most critical accounting policies  estimates  judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in our application of gaap 
critical accounting estimates revenue recognition matrix service records profits on fixed price contracts on a percentage of completion basis  primarily based on costs incurred to date compared to the total estimated contract cost 
matrix service records revenue on reimbursable and time and material contracts based on a proportional performance basis as costs are incurred 
contracts in process are valued at cost plus accrued profits less billings on uncompleted contracts 
contracts are generally considered substantially complete when field construction is completed 
the elapsed time from award of a contract to completion of performance may be in excess of one year 
matrix service includes pass through revenue and costs on cost plus contracts  which are customer reimbursable materials  equipment and subcontractor costs  when matrix service determines that it is responsible for the procurement and management of such cost components on behalf of the customer 
matrix service has numerous contracts that are in various stages of completion which require estimates to determine the appropriate cost and revenue recognition 
matrix service has a history of making reasonably dependable estimates of the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenues and contract costs  and accordingly  does not believe significant fluctuations are likely to materialize 
however  current estimates may be revised as additional information becomes available 
if estimates of costs to complete fixed price contracts indicate a loss  a provision is made through a contract write down for the total loss anticipated 
a number of our contracts contain various cost and performance incentives and penalties that impact the earnings we realize from our contracts 
adjustments related to these incentives and penalties are recorded in the period on a percentage of completion basis when estimable and probable 
indirect costs such as salaries and benefits  supplies and tools  equipment costs and insurance costs are charged to projects based upon direct labor hours and overhead allocation rates per direct labor hour 
warranty costs are normally incurred prior to project completion and are charged to project costs as they are incurred 
warranty costs incurred subsequent to project completion were not material for the periods presented 
overhead allocation rates are established annually during the budgeting process and evaluated for accuracy throughout the year based upon actual direct labor hours and actual costs incurred 

table of contents claims recognition claims are amounts in excess of the agreed contract price or amounts not included in the original contract price that we seek to collect from customers or others for delays  errors in specifications and designs  contract terminations  change orders in dispute or unapproved as to both scope and price or other causes of anticipated additional costs incurred by us 
recognition of amounts as additional contract revenue related to claims is appropriate only if it is probable that the claims will result in additional contract revenue and if the amount can be reliably estimated 
we must determine if there is a legal basis for the claim  the additional costs were caused by circumstances that were unforeseen by the company and are not the result of deficiencies in our performance  the costs are identifiable or determinable and are reasonable in view of the work performed  and the evidence supporting the claim is objective and verifiable 
if all of these requirements are met  revenue from a claim is recorded only to the extent that we have incurred costs relating to the claim 
as of may  and may   accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts included revenues  to the extent of costs incurred  for unapproved change orders of million and million  respectively  and claims of million and million  respectively 
historically  our collections for unapproved change orders and other claims have approximated the amount of revenue recognized 
the following table provides a rollforward of revenue recognized on claims and unapproved change orders 
amounts disclosed for unapproved change orders exclude amounts associated with contract disputes disclosed in note contingencies 
claims for unapproved change orders other claims total in thousands balance at may  additions collections loss balance at may  additions collections loss balance at may  loss contingencies various legal actions  claims  and other contingencies arise in the normal course of our business 
contingencies are recorded in the consolidated financial statements  or are otherwise disclosed  in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for contingencies 
specific reserves are provided for loss contingencies to the extent we conclude their occurrence is both probable and estimable 
we use a case by case evaluation of the underlying data and update our evaluation as further information becomes known 
we believe that any amounts exceeding our recorded accruals should not materially affect our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
however  the results of litigation are inherently unpredictable and the possibility exists that the ultimate resolution of one or more of these matters could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
legal costs are expensed as incurred 

table of contents insurance reserves we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our operations 
however  we retain exposure to potential losses through the use of deductibles  coverage limits and self insured retentions 
as of may  and may   insurance reserves totaling million are reflected on our balance sheet 
these amounts represent our best estimate of our ultimate obligations for asserted claims  insurance premium true up settlement estimates  and claims incurred but not yet reported at the balance sheet date 
we establish specific reserves for claims using a case by case evaluation of the underlying claim data and update our evaluations as further information becomes known 
judgments and assumptions are inherent in our reserve accruals  as a result  changes in assumptions or claims experience could result in changes to these estimates in the future 
additionally  the actual results of claim settlements could differ from the amounts estimated 
goodwill goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized and are tested at least annually for impairment 
we perform our annual analysis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and in any other period in which indicators of impairment warrant an additional analysis 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquisitions over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment by first comparing management s estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill 
reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment calculations are our reportable segments 
management utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units 
significant judgments and assumptions including the discount rate  anticipated revenue growth and gross margins  estimated operating and interest expense  and capital expenditures are inherent in these fair value estimates which are based on our internal operating budgets 
as a result  actual results may differ from the estimates utilized in our discounted cash flow analysis 
the use of alternate judgments and or assumptions could result in a fair value that differs from our estimate and could result in the recognition of an impairment charge in the financial statements 
as a result of these uncertainties  we utilize multiple scenarios and assign probabilities to each of the scenarios in the discounted cash flow analysis 
the results of the discounted cash flow analysis are then compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a computation of the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with its related carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in the amount of the excess 
if an impairment charge is incurred  it would negatively impact our results of operations and financial position 
at the end of the third quarter of fiscal  we conducted an impairment analysis due to the existence of several indicators of impairment 
the impairment indicators stemmed primarily from a decline in operating results and the continuation of several large contract disputes  which increased our overhead costs  reduced our cash flow from operations  caused us to maintain higher than anticipated borrowings under our credit facility  inhibited our ability to refinance our credit facility  increased the likelihood that we would be unable to achieve long term revenue and cash flow targets  reduced our borrowing capacity available to fund new working capital requirements and inhibited our ability to bid on new projects  and caused us to initiate restructuring plans  which included the sale of revenue generating assets 

table of contents the fair value of the construction services segment at february  was estimated to be million compared to a carrying value of million  indicating an impairment to the recorded value of goodwill 
we ultimately recorded an impairment charge of million for our construction services segment in the third quarter of fiscal no impairment was indicated for our repair and maintenance services segment 
as a result of improved operating results over the past several quarters  the resolution of most of our large  disputed contracts and the expansion and extension of our credit facility in november and july  we do not currently anticipate another goodwill impairment for either our construction services or repair and maintenance services segments 
however  certain events may occur that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill 
such events could include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic or competitive conditions  a significant change in the project plans of our customers  the economic condition of the customers and industries we serve  and a material negative change in the relationships with one or more of our significant customers 
if our judgments and assumptions change as a result of the occurrence of any of these events or other events that we do not currently anticipate  our expectations as to future results and our estimate of the implied value of one or more of our reporting units also may change 
thus  for example  assuming that all other components of our fair value estimate remain unchanged  a change in the following assumptions would have the following effect on our fair value estimate if the growth rate of estimated revenue decreases basis points from current estimates  fair value for the construction services segment would be reduced by approximately million and fair value for the repair and maintenance services segment would be reduced by approximately million  if assumed gross margins decrease one percent  fair value for the construction services segment would be reduced by approximately million and fair value for the repair and maintenance services segment would be reduced by approximately million  and if the applicable discount rate increases basis points  fair value for the construction services segment would be decreased by approximately million and fair value for the repair and maintenance services segment would be reduced by approximately million 
our significant assumptions  including revenue growth  gross margins  operating and interest expense and other factors  have been reasonably accurate in recent years  but are likely to change in light of the dynamic competitive environment in which we operate 
however  given the excess of estimated fair value over carrying value of million for the construction services segment and million for the repair and maintenance services segment at may   we do not believe that the illustrative adverse change in each of the assumptions discussed above would cause us to record an impairment charge

table of contents results of operations overview the company has two reportable segments  construction services and repair and maintenance services 
the majority of the work for both segments is performed in the united states with less than of revenues generated in canada during fiscal however  the company does continue to seek opportunities for growth in both the domestic and international markets 
the construction services segment provides turnkey and specialty construction to many industries 
these services including civil structural  mechanical  piping  electrical and instrumentation  millwrighting  and fabrication are provided for projects of varying complexities  schedule durations  and budgets 
our project experience includes renovations  retrofits  modifications and expansions to existing facilities as well as grassroots construction of new facilities 
we specialize in aboveground storage tanks for the bulk storage terminal market  capital construction for the downstream petroleum market  specialty construction  and electrical and instrumentation services 
the repair and maintenance services segment provides a wide range of routine  preventative and emergency repair and maintenance services  outage and turnaround services  including plant maintenance  electrical and instrumentation maintenance  tank inspection  repair and maintenance  industrial cleaning and asme code repairs 
our primary services include aboveground storage tank repair and maintenance  turnarounds and maintenance for the downstream petroleum market  specialty repair and maintenance services and electrical and instrumentation repair and maintenance 
significant fluctuations in revenues  backlog  gross profits and operating results are discussed below on a consolidated basis and for each segment 
revenues fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to many factors  including the changing product mix and project schedules  which are dependent on the level and timing of customer releases of new business 
fiscal year versus consolidated consolidated revenues were in fiscal  an increase of million  or  from consolidated revenues of million in fiscal this large improvement in consolidated revenues resulted from an increase of million in construction services revenues combined with growth of million in repair and maintenance services revenues 
matrix service s backlog has grown since early fiscal and continued to increase throughout fiscal despite the large increase in consolidated revenues 
backlog of million at the end of fiscal represents a improvement when compared to backlog of million at the end of fiscal the construction services segment accounts for of matrix service s backlog at may  consolidated gross profit increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this improvement of million  or  was due to the growth in revenues combined with greater margins contributed by the repair and maintenance services segment 
consolidated gross margins grew from in fiscal to in fiscal due to an improvement in the repair and maintenance services segment  which grew to in the current fiscal year versus in the prior fiscal year 
this improvement stemmed from effective project execution  more efficient absorption of fixed costs due to the larger revenue base and a continued focus by the company on managing its contractual risks  while at the same time working with our customers to meet their strategic objectives 
in addition  margins were further enhanced by a favorable market and an expanding backlog which allowed matrix service to be more selective in its process of procuring projects 
partially offsetting these improvements was a pre tax charge in fiscal of million  or per fully diluted share  resulting from continued cost escalations on a liquefied natural gas lng construction project in the gulf coast region 

table of contents consolidated sg a expenses were million in fiscal compared to million for fiscal the increase of million was primarily due to employee related expenses resulting from additional staff hired throughout fiscal to support our growth combined with additional expense of million related to the fair value recognition provisions in sfas r  share based payment 
partially offsetting this increase was a decline in legal costs of approximately million as the company has settled all but one of its significant contract disputes 
sg a expense as a percentage of revenue fell to in fiscal compared to in the prior fiscal year as the growth in revenues more than offset the increase in sg a expenses 
restructuring charges in fiscal of million relate primarily to additional environmental accruals on a discontinued business and additional workers compensation costs 
restructuring charges in fiscal of million related primarily to professional fees  restructuring incentives and costs to shut down a fabrication facility 
since the restructuring was essentially complete at may   we expect any future costs related to the program to be minimal 
interest expense declined to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this sharp decline of million was primarily due to reduced debt outstanding during the year 
current year interest expense was primarily related to the amortization of prepaid interest and fees on the convertible notes  amortization of deal fees on the senior credit facility  and interest on short term borrowings under the revolving facility 
other income in fiscal of million resulted from gains on the sale of assets identified during the restructuring effort 
other income in fiscal of million consisted of miscellaneous non operating items 
income before income tax expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this million improvement was due to higher gross profit combined with decreased interest expense 
partially offsetting this improvement was higher sg a expense in fiscal along with gains on the sale of assets included in fiscal results 
the effective tax rates for fiscal and fiscal were and  respectively 
both fiscal and fiscal benefited from the tax recognition of losses on disputed contracts 
in fiscal  certain operating loss carryforwards previously reserved were utilized or deemed to be fully utilizable resulting in a benefit of million 
in fiscal  approximately million of previously established valuation allowances were reversed upon the utilization of the related operating loss carryforwards 
net income for fiscal rose to million  or per fully diluted share  versus net income in fiscal of million  or per fully diluted share 
construction services revenues for the construction services segment rose significantly from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  which represents an increase of million  or 
this improvement was primarily due to aboveground storage tank revenues increasing million  but improvements were also seen throughout the segment as downstream petroleum revenues rose million  specialty revenues grew million and electrical and instrumentation revenues climbed million 
the substantial growth in the aboveground storage tank revenues was driven by the strength of the market and capital spending from our core customer base 
the growth in downstream petroleum revenues was primarily due to the performance of work for two additional refinery customers  while the growth in specialty revenues was primarily related to the lng construction project 
backlog increased from million at may  to million at may  the increase of million  or  was primarily due to significant awards for the construction of aboveground storage tank capacity at new terminals and terminal expansions 

table of contents gross profit rose from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  an improvement of 
construction services gross margins declined from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease occurred due to a pre tax charge in fiscal of million on an lng construction project in the gulf coast region 
the charge was a result of a difficult post katrina labor environment  unforeseen productivity challenges and complexity of design leading to material and equipment cost increases 
in addition  weather continued to affect this lump sum project resulting in a more compressed schedule 
the loss recognized this year reflects our best forecast of costs required to achieve our customer s schedule on the remaining of the work 
operating income and income before income tax expense increased to million and million  respectively  in fiscal from operating income and income before income tax expense of million and million in fiscal  respectively 
this significant improvement was the result of additional revenues  combined with lower interest expense 
repair and maintenance services revenues from the repair and maintenance services segment grew million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this improvement resulted primarily from increases in aboveground storage tank revenues of million and electrical and instrumentation revenues of million 
partially offsetting this growth was a reduction in downstream petroleum revenues of million as turnaround work that occurred in fiscal was not fully replaced in fiscal repair and maintenance services backlog increased from million at may  to million at may   an increase of million or 
the increase was driven by leveraging our ast construction customers  resulting in new and additional ast repair and maintenance projects 
gross margins improved to in fiscal as compared to gross margins of in fiscal primarily as the result of more effective project execution and higher revenue volumes relative to the segment s overall fixed cost structure 
gross profit also improved from million in fiscal to million in fiscal operating income and income before income tax expense climbed to million and million  respectively  in fiscal compared to million and million produced in fiscal this improvement was primarily due to higher revenues and margins combined with reduced interest expense 
fiscal year versus consolidated consolidated revenues were million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  from consolidated revenues of million in fiscal the improvement in consolidated revenues resulted from a million increase in construction services revenues combined with an increase of million in repair and maintenance services revenues 
consolidated gross profit increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the improvement of million  or  in gross profit was due to a increase in revenues combined with improved margins 
consolidated gross margins increased from in fiscal to in fiscal due to fiscal including a significant amount of low margin work that has since been replaced with higher margin work from both the construction services and repair and maintenance services segments 
in addition  the larger consolidated revenue base allowed for further absorption of fixed costs while restructuring efforts in late fiscal led to a lower fixed cost structure  which management believed was adequate to support the volume of work 

table of contents consolidated sg a expenses were million in fiscal compared to million for fiscal the decline of million was primarily due to an additional million contract dispute reserve recorded in fiscal as a result of the company s effort to accelerate the collection of amounts owed to improve the liquidity situation at that time 
the company aggressively pursued collections on its contract dispute receivables  therefore  legal costs continued to be significant at million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the remaining reduction in sg a costs was related to restructuring efforts in late fiscal that led to a smaller fixed cost structure in fiscal sg a expense as a percentage of revenue decreased to in fiscal compared to in the prior fiscal year primarily as a result of the increase in revenues combined with the inclusion of the contract dispute reserve in fiscal impairment and abandonment charges of million in fiscal included a million impairment of goodwill in the construction services segment 
our policy is to perform a goodwill impairment review when impairment indicators exist and no less than once per year 
an additional review was performed in the third quarter of fiscal due to impairment indicators related to liquidity issues and operating results 
the remaining charge of million related to a fixed asset impairment taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal restructuring charges in fiscal of million related primarily to professional fees and costs incurred to shut down a fabrication facility that was not required for future operations 
the million charge in fiscal was primarily due to the restructuring program that began in the fourth quarter of fiscal in response to liquidity issues and the company s poor operating results 
the focus of this program was to reduce the cost structure and improve operating results and liquidity 
interest expense increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal this increase was due to higher amortization of debt issuance costs of million and interest of million on the convertible notes issued in april  partially offset by lower cash interest costs of million due to reductions in our debt outstanding and lower interest rates 
other income in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal  both of which resulted from gains on the sale of assets identified during the restructuring effort 
income before income tax expense increased to million in fiscal from a loss before income tax expense of million in fiscal this million improvement was due to higher gross profit and higher gains on the sales of assets in fiscal combined with the inclusion in fiscal of a million contract dispute reserve  impairments of million and restructuring charges of million  partially offset by higher interest expense in fiscal the effective tax rates for fiscal and fiscal were and  respectively 
the unusually low effective tax rate for fiscal was attributable to the absence of a tax benefit for the impairment of goodwill combined with establishing a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets of approximately million 
in fiscal  approximately million of previously established valuation allowances were reversed

this improvement resulted primarily from downstream petroleum revenues which increased million combined with additional specialty revenues of million 
aboveground storage tank revenues improved million 
these improvements were partially offset by declining revenue from electrical and instrumentation  which fell million 
gross profit increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  an increase of 
the increase was driven by improved margins and increased revenues 
construction services gross margins improved from in fiscal to during fiscal as restructuring efforts in late fiscal led to a reduction in our fixed cost structure 
operating income and income before income tax expense increased to million and million  respectively  in fiscal from an operating loss and loss before income tax expense of million and million in fiscal  respectively 
this significant improvement was related to improved margins in fiscal and the inclusion in fiscal of a million contract dispute reserve and a million goodwill impairment 
partially offsetting these improvements was higher interest expense incurred in fiscal repair and maintenance services revenues from repair and maintenance services increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this improvement resulted primarily from increased revenues from aboveground storage tanks  which improved million 
gross margins of for fiscal were higher than gross margins of in fiscal due to the inclusion of higher margin turnaround projects in fiscal gross profit improved from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to an increase in revenues and better margins 

table of contents operating income for fiscal of million was higher than operating income of million produced in fiscal and income before income tax expense for fiscal of million was higher than the million loss before income tax expense in fiscal this improvement was primarily due to the benefit of additional revenues combined with higher margin work partially offset by higher interest expense 
non gaap financial measure ebitda is a supplemental  non generally accepted accounting principle gaap financial measure 
ebitda is defined as earnings before net interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we have presented ebitda because it is used by the financial community as a method of measuring our performance and of evaluating the market value of companies considered to be in similar businesses 
we believe that the line item on our consolidated statements of operations entitled net income loss is the most directly comparable gaap measure to ebitda 
since ebitda is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with gaap  it should not be considered in isolation of  or as a substitute for  net earnings as an indicator of operating performance 
ebitda  as we calculate it  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies 
in addition  this measure is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs 
as ebitda excludes certain financial information compared with net income loss  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure  users of this financial information should consider the type of events and transactions  which are excluded 
our non gaap performance measure  ebitda  has certain material limitations as follows it does not include interest income or expense 
because we have borrowed money to finance our operations  interest expense is a necessary and ongoing part of our costs and has assisted us in generating revenue 
therefore  any measure that excludes interest expense has material limitations 
it does not include taxes 
because the payment of taxes is a necessary and ongoing part of our operations  any measure that excludes taxes has material limitations 
it does not include depreciation and amortization expense 
because we use capital assets to generate revenue  depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of our cost structure 
therefore  any measure that excludes depreciation and amortization expense has material limitations 
a reconciliation of ebitda to net income loss follows fiscal year ended may  in thousands net income loss interest expense  net provision benefit for income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda the million increase in ebitda for the year ended may  as compared to the prior year was the result of profitable growth experienced in fiscal  partially offset by a charge on an lng construction contract of million 
the million increase in ebitda for the year ended may   as compared to the prior year  was in part due to improved operations that occurred as a result of the company s restructuring and turnaround efforts  which resulted in higher revenues and margins in fiscal in addition  impairment charges of million  a million contract dispute reserve and restructuring charges of million were recorded in fiscal 
table of contents outlook our dedication to achieving further improvement in our safety performance and our commitment to hiring  developing and retaining a skilled workforce will be two of our top initiatives for the upcoming year 
by focusing on customer service and project execution  the robust growth and expansion opportunities in our core markets will have matrix service poised to reach record net income levels in fiscal the company expects that revenues for the fiscal year ending may   will be between million and million 
gross margins for repair and maintenance services are expected to be between and  and gross margins for construction services are expected to be between and 
with revenues weighted at for construction services and for repair and maintenance services  we anticipate consolidated gross margins to be between and 
sg a is expected to be between and of revenues 
no convertible notes remain outstanding at may  and the seller financed debt will be retired in march  therefore  we expect a continued reduction in interest expense for fiscal however  borrowings to fund the stock buyback program or other strategic investments could result in an offsetting increase in interest 
as of may   matrix service had a net cash position in excess of million 
the effective tax rate should be and matrix service should average approximately million fully diluted shares outstanding throughout the year 

table of contents financial condition and liquidity overview we define liquidity as the ongoing ability to pay our liabilities as they become due  fund business operations and meet all monetary contractual obligations 
our primary sources of liquidity in fiscal were cash flows from operations and borrowings under our senior revolving credit facility 
cash on hand at may  totaled million and availability under the senior revolving credit facility totaled million resulting in total liquidity of million 
factors that routinely impact our short term liquidity include  but are not limited to changes in working capital contract terms that determine the timing of billings to customers and the collection of those billings some cost plus and fixed price customer contracts are billed based on milestones which may require us to incur significant expenditures prior to collections from our customers 
time and material contracts are normally billed in arrears 
therefore  we are routinely required to carry these costs until they can be billed and collected 
some of our large construction projects require retentions 
significant capital expenditures in the future  we may elect to increase the revolving credit facility or raise additional capital by issuing common stock  convertible notes or term debt as necessary to fund our operations 
in fiscal  we expect cash flows from operations to be a significant source of liquidity  which we expect will fund additional investments in capital assets 
however  we will continue to evaluate our working capital requirements and other factors to maintain sufficient liquidity 
cash flows from operating activities operations generated million in cash in fiscal the cash generated from operations was due primarily to improved profitability partially offset by an unfavorable increase in operating assets and liabilities of million 
the increase in working capital was primarily due to increased receivables of million 
the increase in receivables was due to higher revenues  the timing of certain billings and higher retention amounts 
an increase in cost in excess of billings of million negatively impacted cash  while an increase to billings in excess of costs of million positively impacted cash 
the costs in excess of billings and billings in excess of cost increases were expected given the increase in fiscal revenues 
an increase in accounts payable positively impacted cash million and an increase in accrued liabilities positively impacted cash by million 
the accounts payable increase was due to the timing of invoice receipts at year end while the accrued liability increase is due mainly to the timing of payrolls at year end which has increased accrued wages 
cash flows from investing activities investing activities used million in cash in fiscal this was due to capital expenditures of million partially offset by proceeds from asset sales of million 
fiscal capital expenditures included million for the purchase of construction equipment  million for transportation equipment  million for furniture and fixtures  and million for land and buildings 
we also routinely acquire assets utilizing capital leases 
assets acquired through capital leases totaled million in fiscal and are reported as non cash additions to property  plant and equipment 
the board of directors has approved a capital spending budget of million for fiscal capital to replace  repair or maintain equipment represents million  or of the total capital budget 
we also expect to invest million  or of the total budget in new assets to increase fabrication capacity and to equip additional construction and maintenance crews in targeted growth markets 
the remaining million  or of the total budget is to purchase  expand or improve facilities to address the company s need for additional office and shop space 

table of contents cash flows from financing activities financing activities generated million in cash in fiscal exercises of stock options generated million in cash as our policy is to issue shares from treasury and retain the cash received from the exercise 
as required by sfas no 
r  share based payment  the tax benefit we received from option exercises is reported as a financing cash flow and totaled million in fiscal the cash generated by the stock option exercises was partially offset by the scheduled payment on the acquisition note payable of million  capital lease payments of million and payment of fees relating to the november refinancing of the senior credit facility 
senior revolving credit facility the senior revolving credit facility is primarily used to fund short term changes in working capital and issuance of letters of credit 
the total capacity of the facility at may  was million with million outstanding for letters of credit that have been issued to support certain workers compensation insurance programs and to secure the final payment under the acquisition note payable 
the facility provides an option to increase total capacity to million  with the approval of the administrative agent and the company is currently in the process of seeking such approval 
we believe the senior credit facility provides adequate liquidity and financial flexibility to support our expected growth in fiscal the facility contains customary negative covenants including limits on other indebtedness  operating and capital lease obligations  asset sales  dividends and certain other distributions 
the facility also contains financial covenants that require us to maintain certain financial ratios  which could reduce availability under the facility in future periods 
we are currently in compliance with all covenants and have full availability under the facility 
convertible notes convertible notes  with a principal balance of million  were issued through a private placement transaction on april  an initial interest prepayment of million was made in conjunction with the issuance for the period up to and including april  subsequent to april   any convertible notes which remained outstanding would have borne interest at or per annum as determined by our leverage ratio 
interest was payable in arrears on each calendar quarter end beginning on june  the convertible notes and related securities purchase agreement required us to maintain certain financial ratios and placed limits on certain types of transactions including  but not limited to  caps on borrowing under the senior credit facility  limits on capital lease obligations  limits on operating leases and limits on debt under our performance and bonding lines 
the notes were convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
as of may   million of the convertible notes had been converted into  shares of our common stock 
in fiscal  the remaining million of notes were converted into  shares of our common stock 
acquisition payable as part of an acquisition in fiscal  we deferred a portion of the purchase price to be paid in annual installments over five years 
the final payment of million is due on march  dividend policy we have never paid cash dividends on our common stock 
we currently intend to retain earnings to finance the growth and development of our business

table of contents foreign currency risk matrix service has subsidiaries with operations in canada with canadian dollar as their functional currency 
historically  movements in the foreign currency exchange rate have not significantly impacted results 
however  growth in our canadian operations and fluctuations in the canadian dollar could impact the company s financial results in the future 
management has not entered into derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency risk  but periodically evaluates the materiality of our foreign currency exposure

dollar would not have had a material impact on the financial results of the company for the fiscal year ended may  commodity risk steel and steel pipe are the primary raw materials used by the company 
supplies of these materials are available throughout the united states 
we do not anticipate being unable to obtain adequate amounts of these materials in the foreseeable future 
however  the price  quantity available and timing of availability of these materials could change significantly due to various factors  including producer capacity  the level of foreign imports  demand for the materials  the imposition or removal of tariffs on imported steel and other market conditions 
we mitigate these risks by including standard language in our contracts  which passes the risk of increases in steel prices or unavailability of steel to our customers
