voluntary review of stock option practices during fiscal year  we completed a voluntary internal review and independent investigation into past stock option granting practices 
the voluntary review was undertaken when an internal review of past practices related to grants of stock options revealed information that raised potential questions about the dates used to account for certain stock option grants 
in october  we announced that  at the recommendation of the audit committee of the company s board of directors the board  the board appointed an independent director to serve as a special committee to conduct an investigation into our historic stock option granting practices 
based on the report of the special committee and on management s preliminary conclusions and recommendations  the board concluded that incorrect measurement dates were used for financial accounting purposes for certain stock options granted between january  and december  and that the financial statements  related notes and selected financial data and all financial press releases and similar communications issued by us and the related reports of the company s independent registered public accounting firm relating to fiscal years through  and the first fiscal quarter of  should no longer be relied upon 
to correct the inaccuracies  on april   we filed an amendment to our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended march  to restate our consolidated balance sheets for the fiscal years ended march  and march   consolidated statements of operations  stockholders equity and cash flows for the fiscal years ended march   march  and march   page of 
table of contents unaudited quarterly financial data for each of the quarters in the fiscal years ended march  and march   selected financial data as of and for the fiscal years ended march   march   march   march  and march   and related disclosures 
as of result of revising the measurement dates  the company recognized million in additional share based compensation expense arising from stock grants to executive officers and employees 
of this amount  approximately million related to options granted to executive officers who  at the time of the grant  were subject to the reporting requirements under section of the exchange act of none of the additional share based compensation expense arose from grants made to non employee directors 
in addition  on april   we filed an amendment to our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended june  to restate our consolidated balance sheet for the three months ended june  consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for the three months ended june  and june   and related disclosures 
the adjustments did not affect our previously reported revenue  cash  cash equivalents  or marketable securities balances in any of the restated periods 
for further detail  please see our form k a and form q a filed with the commission on april  overview we were incorporated in california in  became a public company in and were reincorporated in the state of delaware in february through most of our corporate existence  we provided ics for personal computer applications  including personal computer pc graphics and storage 
in  we refocused our business efforts away from these areas  which we believed had become commodity like in terms of pricing and offered diminished opportunities for sustained product differentiation and profitability 
we reinforced our commitment to maintain profitability by taking strategic actions during fiscal year and the first part of fiscal year to improve our top and bottom line growth  including improving efficiencies by completing implementation of a product line structure focusing on our product lines including analog mixed signal products  embedded products  and industrial products  divesting ourselves of our digital video product line assets to focus on our core strengths  and enhancing operations by moving to a completely fabless business model 
during fiscal year  we drove gross margins to percent for the year 
this represented an increase of percent over the fiscal year gross margin of percent 
on december   we completed our acquisition of percent of the voting equity interests in caretta  a company based in shanghai  china that specializes in designing power management integrated circuits for the large  single cell lithium ion battery market 
this acquisition was undertaken to strengthen and diversify our analog and mixed signal product portfolios as well as position us for growth within the chinese market 
in addition  we realized a tax benefit of approximately million that was predominantly related to the release of a portion of our valuation allowance with respect to certain deferred tax assets that we expect to utilize within the next fiscal year 
during fiscal year  we completed the outstanding litigation with fujitsu for a net million and enhanced our financial position by obtaining million from a one time cash receipt associated with an amendment to an existing licensing agreement  in which certain rights to cirrus logic were terminated from a prior cross license agreement 
further  we were able to realize a tax benefit of approximately million due to the expiration of certain statutes related to non us tax liabilities 
we may incur taxes in many of the non us and us state tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
over the course of fiscal year  we enhanced our focus on operations and decreased our expenses in research and development and sales  general  and administrative by a total of million when compared to the previous year 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million for fiscal year on a pre tax loss of million 
this benefit was the result of reversals of prior year us federal and non us tax liabilities 
although we continue to defend our patents and investigate the potential for leveraging our intellectual property portfolio  we do not anticipate the same level of benefits we have received in the past to reoccur in the future

table of contents net sales march  march  march  mixed signal audio products embedded products industrial products video products total net sales for fiscal year decreased million  or percent  to million from million in fiscal year the drop in net sales is primarily related to the absence of revenues from our digital video product line  a product line we divested in fiscal year this decrease was accentuated by a million decrease in revenues from our mixed signal product line  which is primarily related to a decrease in revenues from legacy products 
these decreases were partially offset by increased sales from our industrial product line of million 
net sales for fiscal year decreased million  or percent  to million from million in fiscal year net sales from our embedded processor products were up million in fiscal year due to increased revenue from a non recurring united states government project  as well as increased demand for arm based products and our communications related products 
we also saw revenue growth in our industrial product line  of which million was due to higher demand for our power meter products 
these increases were offset by a decrease of million in net sales of our video products  as we sold our digital video related product line during fiscal year net sales of our mixed signal products decreased million due to various product mix changes between our digital to analog and analog to digital converters 
export sales  principally to asia  including sales to us based customers with manufacturing plants overseas  were approximately million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year export sales to customers located in asia were percent of net sales in fiscal year and percent of net sales in both fiscal year and all other export sales represented percent  percent  and percent of net sales in fiscal years   and  respectively

sales to avnet  inc formerly memec holdings group represented percent  percent  and percent in fiscal years   and  respectively 
no other customers or distributors accounted for percent or more of net sales in fiscal years   or the loss of a significant customer or a significant reduction in a customer s orders could have an adverse affect on our sales 
gross margin gross margin was percent in fiscal year  up from percent in fiscal year the improvement in margins from fiscal year is mainly due to changes in product mix and the absence of the video product line 
the sale of product that had been written down in prior fiscal years contributed approximately million  or percent  to gross margins compared to contribution of approximately million  or percent  in fiscal year in total  excess and obsolete inventory charges increased by million from fiscal year  which decreased gross margins by percentage points 
gross margin was percent in fiscal year  up from percent in fiscal year in fiscal year  we completed the sale of our digital video product line assets

the sale of product that had been written down in prior fiscal years contributed approximately million  or percent of gross margin percentage compared with percent contribution to margin in fiscal year in total  excess and obsolete inventory charges decreased by million from fiscal year  which increased gross margins by percentage points 
research and development expenses fiscal year research and development expenses decreased million from fiscal year due to a decrease in expenses associated with the divestiture of the digital video product line 
amortization of intangibles decreased by page of 
table of contents million from the prior year  million of which was attributable to the absence of amortization on intangibles we sold to magnum semiconductor inc magnum as part of the divestiture 
the divestiture also led to a million decrease in salaries due to lower average headcount  lower vacation expenses  and lower tax expense 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in stock compensation expense associated with the fiscal year adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas r  share based payment 
fiscal year research and development expenses decreased million from fiscal year due in large part to the decrease in expenses associated with the sale of the digital video product line assets in early fiscal year and our cost savings measures from fiscal year research and development expenses  including amortization of acquired intangibles  decreased as a percentage of net sales to percent in fiscal year from percent in fiscal year amortization of acquired intangibles decreased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year this is primarily due to a million increase in stock compensation expense associated with the fiscal year adoption of sfas r and the recognition of million in loss contingencies on facilities we currently sublease 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in professional fees associated with the conclusion of the magnum divestiture and the resolution of certain outstanding legal disputes 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year this was primarily due to charges associated with million in loss contingency accruals on certain properties recently sub leased to a third party by cirrus logic during the current year and a benefit recorded in fiscal year related to a million release of a use tax accrual coupled with a refund of million related to recovered non us goods and sales tax 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of net sales from percent in fiscal year to percent in fiscal year restructuring costs and other  net during fiscal year  we recorded restructuring charges of million to operating expenses primarily related to the transition of design activities from our boulder  colorado office to our headquarters in austin  texas 
the restructuring costs for the closure of the boulder design center were composed of million in severance and relocation costs and million in facility related charges 
approximately twenty employees were affected by this action  five of whom relocated to our austin headquarters 
during fiscal year  we recorded a restructuring charge of million in operating expenses for severance and facility related items associated with workforce reductions related to the sale of the digital video product line assets and changes to sub lease assumptions regarding exited facilities 
this action affected approximately individuals worldwide and resulted in a net charge of approximately million 
in connection with the digital video product line asset sale  we ceased using certain leased office space in our fremont  california location 
accordingly  we recorded a restructuring charge of million related to the exit from this facility 
partially offsetting the restructuring charge was million related to the gain on the digital video product line asset sale 
for further detail  see note  non marketable securities 
during fiscal year  we recorded a net restructuring charge of million in operating expenses for facility consolidations primarily in california and texas  an impairment charge of million for technology licenses and equipment that will no longer be used due to our workforce reductions and a charge of million related to workforce reductions 
we expected to realize approximately million to million in savings in annual research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses due to the related headcount reductions and facility consolidation activities 
during fiscal year  we did realize these expected savings as noted earlier in the research and development discussion 
further  as we continue to monitor our operating expenses  facility accruals  divestiture opportunities and space utilizations  we may record additional restructuring charges related to these items
