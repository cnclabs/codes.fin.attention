item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a further discussion of the impact of these charges on both fiscal and fiscal the triactiv system platform was designed to prevent debris from traveling downstream from the treatment site during stenting procedures 
embolic debris is closely associated with the adverse events of heart attacks and strokes in patients undergoing certain types of interventional procedures 
clinical results from the aspire registry showed the company s new triactiv fx system showed an extremely high rate of effectiveness of preventing major adverse cardiac events mace in a saphenous vein graft population  and early results from our studies using the triactiv proguard in the carotid anatomy showed similar excellent clinical efficacy 
the clinical effectiveness of the device had been a primary driver of the investment that our company had made in the platform over the last several years 
our biomaterials business overview we have developed significant proprietary technology and unique expertise in the field of resorbable biomaterials  a segment that has garnered increasing interest in recent years for a wide variety of medical applications 
working with our own proprietary collagen biomaterials and an extensive array of biomaterials sourced from third parties  we use our technology platforms to develop and manufacture novel implantable 
table of contents medical devices 
these products and technologies are commercialized in the end user market place through third party customer relationships and co development agreements 
our technology platforms have application in devices used for soft tissue and bone fixation 
fixation devices such as anchors  screws  pins and plates are often required in sports medicine procedures  for example  anterior cruciate ligament repairs and tendon repairs  and in trauma procedures which require the resetting of broken bones  repair and regeneration of bone and cartilage tissues 
bone grafting is required in a large number of procedures ranging from spinal fusion  to trauma  to dental procedures 
cartilage regeneration  if successful  could lead to deferment of major joint replacement surgeries  repair and regeneration of a wide variety of soft tissues 
soft tissue is found throughout the body in the form of tendons  ligaments and body wall tissues 
many surgical procedures  such as hernia repair and pelvic floor reconstructions involve the use of devices designed to repair or reinforce soft tissue  and delivery of drugs and growth factors 
local drug delivery at the site of treatment is possible from many types of biomaterial scaffolds 
much of our resorbable biomaterials technology revolves around customized porous scaffolds that are well suited for these tissue engineering and drug delivery applications 
we also have extensive experience with scale up and large scale production of bioresorbable products  and have built a facility and infrastructure that have been customized for the unique requirements of this business 
a major part of our biomaterials business is supplying component materials to st 
jude medical for use in the angio seal device  and developing new versions of those components as st 
jude medical continues to evolve the product 
we also manufacture a large number and wide variety of fixation devices used in sports medicine and orthopaedic trauma procedures 
our company collaborates with many leading orthopaedic companies  and has co developed a number of synthetic bone grafting materials in partnership with them 
one of our most successful partnerships  to date  has been with orthovita  inc  a publicly traded biomaterials company that has a platform technology for regenerating bone 
our two companies have collaborated to create a series of new products  branded vitoss foam and vitoss pack  that have become one of the leading product lines in the bone graft market 
we offer a complete range of capabilities  including design  development  regulatory consulting  and full scale manufacturing of finished medical devices  to our customers and partners 
biomaterials market overview biomaterials can be defined as materials that treat  augment  or replace tissue  organs or body functions 
our company has specialized in resorbable biomaterials  meaning materials that meet the above definition  and that also go away over time and allow the body s natural tissue to take their place 
the first resorbable biomaterials implants used in medical applications were resorbable sutures  first introduced in human use over thirty years ago 
in the late s and early s  our company became an innovator in expanding the use of biomaterials to other types of medical applications with our development of the angio seal device  a vascular closure system that incorporates three different resorbable materials as the basis for the product 
our experiences in developing and scaling up the manufacturing of this product line  provided the basis for our biomaterials business today 
medical device companies  focusing on a wide variety of market segments  are now taking advantage of advances in materials technology and a better understanding of the biological processes involved in tissue formation and healing to introduce resorbable biomaterials based products 
this trend has been observed in many medical markets  including orthopaedic  general  urological  cosmetic  and dental surgeries 
companies and 
table of contents surgeons are widely seeking new solutions to long standing clinical problems 
resorbable biomaterials based products have shown to be attractive solutions in these markets for a number of reasons 
they allow for the regeneration and remodeling of natural tissue as the bioresorbable implant resorbs over time  offer the ability to modify the rate of absorption of products to promote healing as the biomaterials based products work with and assist the body s natural healing response  obviate the need for second surgeries  which are commonly needed to remove non resorbable implants  reduce the effect of imaging technologies seen with metallic implants  which is critical to the ability to visualize and assess healing  and offer the potential for drug delivery specific to the clinical situation 
the ability to provide staged and sustained release of drugs and biologics offers significant potential for growth in the use of absorbable biomaterials based products 
our biomaterials business strategy we intend to utilize our experience and expertise in biomaterials to continue to expand our business 
our strategy to accomplish this expansion is as follows develop new proprietary biomaterials products 
we continue to leverage our technology and expertise in materials and processes to develop new proprietary biomaterials products 
by working with corporate partners in some cases  and in other cases directly with surgeon clinicians  we can identify desirable attributes of new bioresorbable products and advance them towards commercialization 
expand our biomaterials customer base 
we intend to broaden the product lines sold to our current customer base  and to expand our number of customers by providing proprietary and technologically superior biomaterials products 
we also intend to continue to invest in new manufacturing technology and processes to meet our customers requirements  support product launches and increase the demand for our biomaterials products 
additionally  we plan to expand our marketing efforts to identify new potential customers in existing and new markets 
pursue strategic acquisitions and alliances 
we continually seek strategic acquisitions and alliances that add complementary technologies and expertise  broaden our intellectual property portfolio and strengthen our competitive position in our biomaterials business 
we believe that our expertise in biomaterials allows us to identify and attract these opportunities 
our biomaterials technology the technological challenges involved in developing biomaterials based products can be substantial 
having worked with these types of materials and processes for close to twenty years  our company has built significant know how and technology in the field 
materials technology 
many of the products we have developed incorporate our highly proprietary bovine collagen technology  which has an extensive safety profile and many unique properties making it suitable for multiple medical device applications 
our collagen can be fabricated in many forms  including powders  gels  pastes  sponges and other structural matrices 
we often combine collagen with other materials  such as ceramics and hyaluronic acids to further create new properties and characteristics 
our ability to utilize multiple process variables  such as fiber structure  cross linking a process for strengthening the collagen material and chemistry  additionally increases the number of product configurations and properties that we can offer 
we also have extensive experience with processing a wide range of resorbable synthetic polymers  including pla  pga  plla and many others 
controlling architecture and processing variation of such 
table of contents polymers is a strong area of expertise for our company  and allows us to create unique properties and composite materials 
processing technology 
our porous tissue matrix ptm processing technology allows us to create porous implants that support cell growth  tissue regeneration and the delivery of biologics  growth factors and drugs 
the ptm technology allows us to create customized porous architectures  and in some applications  combine different materials in such a way that optimizes the desired tissue engineering and drug delivery outcomes 
the resulting implants can be designed to facilitate wound healing in both bone and soft tissue and are bioabsorbable at controlled rates for specific functions and tissues 
we have a series of products and development programs underway utilizing intellectual property related to our porous biodegradable regeneration matrices 
drug delivery technology 
our biomaterials technology is particularly useful for the controlled release of drugs and other biologically active agents  such as growth factors 
in these applications  the drug is deposited or incorporated into a biomaterials delivery matrix 
as the matrix dissolves or is degraded by the body  the drug is gradually released 
the use of a biomaterials matrix for drug delivery permits a locally targeted  low dose release profile  improving the delivery of the drug 
manufacturing scale up know how 
resorbable biomaterials based products tend to be particularly challenging to consistently manufacture on a large scale 
there are variations in materials and material properties that must be continually controlled and monitored 
we have core competencies in anticipating such variables and controlling them during our manufacturing processes 
we believe the diversity of the applications and projects on which we have worked  the wide variety of materials that we have worked with and created  and the scale of commercialization experience we have  all contribute to a sustainable competitive advantage in the biomaterials based products markets in which we compete 
biomaterials product lines and product applications we have consistently focused on supporting the growth of the angio seal product line in the market place  and have also commercialized a broad array of products used primarily in orthopaedic markets 
to a lesser extent  we have also commercialized biomaterials products for other market applications  such as diagnostic oncology  general surgery and dentistry 
while we have chosen to concentrate much of our efforts on angio seal components and orthopaedic related products  to date  we believe that there are also significant opportunities for our technologies in other markets 
angio seal components 
we manufacture two of the key absorbable components of the angio seal device for st 
jude medical of their supply requirements for the collagen sponge and at least of their requirements for the polymer anchors under an angio seal component supply contract that expires in the collagen sponge and the polymer anchor components form the basis for the resorbable implant that acts to seal the hole left in an artery after a catheterization procedure and are critical to the functionality of the device 
there are different component designs for different versions of the angio seal device  and our company has continued to work with st 
jude medical as they continue to advance the product line 
orthopaedic products 
our company has commercialized a wide variety of products in orthopaedic applications of biomaterials 
applications in the orthopaedic market for our biomaterials products include soft tissue and bone fixation  bone void fillers and scaffolds 
in the future  we believe there will be application for our technologies in the regeneration of tendons  ligaments and cartilage  as well as other novel uses of materials in other orthopaedic procedures such as intervertebral disc repair 
soft tissue and bone fixation 
many of our biomaterials products are designed to replace metallic devices used in the fixation and repair of musculoskeletal tissues 
use of resorbable biomaterials eliminates the need for a second surgery  which is frequently necessary to remove non resorbable 
table of contents metallic implants like bone screws  plates and pins  among other advantages 
the primary application for our biomaterials in the sports medicine arena is soft tissue fixation 
soft tissue fixation includes the repair of tendons and ligaments in the knee  such as the anterior cruciate ligament  in the shoulder  such as the rotator cuff  and in the extremities 
we manufacture products such as suture anchors  interference screws and reinforcement materials for all of these applications made from resorbable synthetic polymers and synthetic polymer ceramic composites 
we also manufacture pins  plates and screws of various designs for repair of the small bones of the extremities  for certain applications in the spine  and for other orthopaedic trauma applications 
bone void fillers and scaffolds 
synthetic bone void fillers are increasingly being used as alternatives to autograft bone harvested from another area of the patient s body or allograft bone harvested from cadavers 
we have developed or co developed several different bone void fillers  essentially synthetic bone graft substitutes  for use in various clinical applications 
we have fabricated these products from collagen  collagen ceramic composites  synthetic polymers or synthetic ceramic composite biomaterials 
our orthofill bone void filler product is our own proprietary bone void filler  designed with our proprietary collagen technology  and using our synthetic polymer ptm technology with ceramic 
this design creates an architecture optimized for certain types of bone void filling applications 
the orthofill bone void filler device utilizes a similar material composite as our proprietary tissue engineering implant designed to repair damaged articular cartilage in the knee or other articulating joints 
we are continuing development of our cartilage repair matrix to repair articular cartilage defects 
see long term biomaterials research programs below 
our company entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with biomet sports medicine for orthofill bone void filler  which biomet has branded as osseofit porous tissue matrix 
other biomaterials market applications 
while not a large part of our business to date  our company does manufacture and sell a variety of biomaterials based products designed for other market applications 
these products include resorbable breast biopsy markers  dental barrier membranes  and wound care products  among other things 
one of these products is our proprietary epi guide barrier membrane used in periodontal restorative procedures to prevent soft tissue cells from growing into space reserved for bone 
the epi guide product is distributed worldwide by curasan  inc our company is also establishing relationships with potential partners that are interested in our proprietary sheet soft tissue reinforcement and repair technologies  such as our bioblanket surgical mesh fabricated of a proprietary collagen material 
biomaterials customer relationships we sell our biomaterials products to over companies who sell them into the end user marketplace 
our largest biomaterials customers include st 
jude medical  to whom we supply angio seal components  arthrex  inc  to whom we supply a broad range of sports medicine and trauma products  and orthovita  inc  to whom we supply products for use in repair of the spine and orthopaedic trauma injuries 
we also supply biomaterials products and development expertise to other orthopaedic companies including  medtronic  inc  zimmer  inc  biomet sports medicine  inc  and biomimetic therapeutics  inc 
in fiscal  we plan to continue to expand relationships with companies targeting new markets  including general  pelvic and urological surgery 
although a majority of our biomaterials sales are currently concentrated among a few strategic customers  the number has been expanding over the last several years 
the relationship with these customers and partners is generally long term and contractual in nature  with contracts specifying development and regulatory responsibilities  the specifications of the product to be supplied  and pricing 
our company often works with customers and potential customers at very early stages of feasibility  and provides significant input in co development types of programs 
once a product is approved for sale  we generally provide our customers 
table of contents fully packaged and sterilized products ready for their further distribution  or as in the case with angio seal components  provide a bioresorbable product that is ready to be incorporated into a finished device 
our products often represent a key strategic source for these customers and partners 
in many cases  our proprietary technology is incorporated in the product and can not be replicated by other companies 
our largest customer during fiscal was st 
jude medical  inc to whom we supply angio seal components 
during fiscal  of our net sales biomaterials and of our total revenues  including royalty income  were derived from our relationship with st 
jude medical 
our second largest customer during the fiscal year was arthrex  inc  a privately held orthopaedics company  a company that focuses on sports medicine and trauma related products for the extremities 
we provide a large number of soft tissue and bone fixation devices to them 
during fiscal  of our net sales biomaterials and of our total revenues were derived from our relationship with arthrex 
orthovita  inc has become a major customer in recent years 
since  we have partnered with them to co develop and commercialize a series of unique and proprietary bone void filler products  branded vitoss foam and vitoss pack  the first of which was launched in march under our agreement with orthovita  we manufacture the products and they market and sell the products worldwide 
multiple versions of these co developed products have been launched since march during fiscal  of our net sales biomaterials and of our total revenues  including royalty income  were derived from our relationship with orthovita 
medtronic  inc  zimmer  inc  and biomet sports medicine inc  are newer partners customers that are in the early stages of launching their respective product lines 
we believe these relationships and product lines will continue to develop and grow over the next several years 
we have not yet commercialized our products with biomimetic therapeutics  inc business development activities for our biomaterials business are primarily conducted by our senior management team 
technology and product evaluations and the related business agreements can take long periods of time to complete 
our marketing efforts are focused on the partnering of our technology and expertise to new potential customers  as well as seeking sales and marketing organizations for those specific products that we have developed 
acquisition of macropore in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we acquired certain assets of the assets of the macropore biosurgery spinal and orthopaedic business unit of cytori therapeutics  inc for million in cash 
since  macropore biosurgery had been a leading developer of bioresorbable products targeted in spinal  craniofacial  and orthopaedic surgery applications 
the commercialized products acquired in the transaction include a bioresorbable graft containment system and other spinal and orthopaedic devices 
the acquired business unit encompasses the manufacturing of six bioresorbable product lines  which are sold to a leading orthopaedic device company for worldwide distribution 
the assets of the business unit included manufacturing equipment  intellectual property and inventory 
we are in the process of transitioning the manufacturing of the product lines to our exton  pennsylvania facility 
long term biomaterials research programs while in the near future a significant portion of our biomaterials business will come from customer relationships in which we work with companies to commercialize near term biomaterials product concepts  we have also been advancing development programs that are longer term in nature and are based on our proprietary technology in the following areas articular cartilage regeneration matrix 
we are developing a cartilage repair device designed to repair focal defects of articular cartilage in joints 
the design has a collagen based cartilage region and 
table of contents a ceramic polymer subcondral bone region based on our ptm technology 
these compartmentalized architectures are designed to allow for the regeneration of both the cartilage and bone elements of the defects and their interface 
this research culminated in the performance of three large pre clinical studies 
biomet sports medicine has the opportunity to collaborate with us to advance the research and development of our cartilage repair matrix  and participate in future pre clinical and clinical studies 
annulus repair closure device and delivery system 
we are co developing a unique technology to allow surgeons to repair the outer ring portion of the disc in the spine  referred to as the annulus 
this technology could be utilized to facilitate repair of the defect created in the treatment of herniated discs and of the defect that is created in many of the newer nucleus replacement technologies currently being developed 
during fiscal  we continued to perform several pre clinical evaluations in conjunction with a partner with whom we have entered into a joint development agreement 
porous resorbable interbody spacer 
we are developing a resorbable interbody spacer of adequate strength for cervical fusion applications 
the concept incorporates our ptm technology  which will allow for a porous structure resulting in less polymer  a smoother degradation of the implant and incorporation of various growth factors 
this development program will continue with further pre clinical activities planned in fiscal for most of these major product programs  our company does not plan to commercialize the technology on our own  instead  we intend to enter into licensing and distribution agreements that may include milestone payments  development funding  royalty payments and manufacturing revenue 
kensey nash will also  from time to time  seek grant revenue to support on going research 
in the past  we had undertaken some development work  using our ptm technology  to create a synthetic vascular graft and also to create a matrix suitable for the sustained or controlled release of chemotherapeutic drugs for the treatment of breast cancer 
while these programs generated interesting and promising progress  they both are on hold pending interest from a third party 
our endovascular business overview over the last several years  we have devoted significant resources to creating a family of proprietary endovascular products to market in the us and europe 
these products are focused in the emerging markets of thrombectomy and chronic total occlusions ctos 
our thrombectomy and aspiration products are complementary products designed to remove thrombus blood clots from the patient during interventional procedures 
our cto a complete vessel blockage common in both coronary and peripheral vessels platform is based on technology acquired from intraluminal therapeutics  inc ilt in may the safe cross system  acquired from ilt  uses radio frequency energy and sophisticated optical guidance to help physicians treat these difficult total occlusions of the vasculature 
all of these products are sold to interventional cardiologists  but may also be used by interventional radiologists and vascular surgeons 
an overview of our products is as follows thromcat thrombectomy catheter system easy to use  powerful  fully disposable  thrombectomy catheter incorporating heliflex technology  an internal helix which rotates at approximately  rotations per minute to evacuate thrombus from the target vessel 
fda cleared for synthetic graft and native fistula vessel indication 
initial market release commenced late september 
table of contents ce mark approved for coronary and peripheral indications received october european launch initiated immediately thereafter 
coronary study completed in europe with favorable results 
quickcat extraction catheter simple  easy to use  aspiration catheter that removes thrombus in a syringe based system 
fda cleared and ce mark approved for all arterial indications 
launched in april in the us and in august in europe 
safe cross rf cto system radio frequency powered guidewires that incorporate optical coherence reflectometry technology to provide guidance for crossing ctos 
fda cleared for both coronary and peripheral indications 
transition of manufacturing to exton  pennsylvania facility complete  following acquisition of safe cross technology in may re launch of product taking place in the us ce mark approval process pending 
our endovascular strategy we intend to utilize our unique endovascular product platforms as a foundation for expanding our business 
we believe our investments in manufacturing  research and development  and sales and marketing towards commercializing our proprietary endovascular products have positioned our company for enhanced revenue and earnings growth opportunities 
we further believe that the endovascular markets in which we are participating have favorable demographics in expanding markets  making them attractive ones in which to participate with new technologies 
our strategy to accomplish this business expansion is as follows commercialize easy to use  clinically important products in emerging market sectors 
our company has chosen to focus on the emerging market segments of thrombus removal and cto treatment therapy 
while thrombus removal has been established as a treatment modality in coronary and dialysis markets  we believe there are significant opportunities for improved products that combine ease of use and effectiveness 
longer term  there could be opportunities for these therapies in a wide variety of anatomies and conditions  including the treatment of deep vein thrombosis 
similarly in the cto market segment  interventional technologies have not been widely adopted because very few products have shown effectiveness 
we believe the safe cross system  based on a guidewire platform  with built in guidance provides an easy to use technology that will be beneficial in solving the clinically important problem of cto treatment 
use a direct sales force model in the us we believe  at this time  our direct sales model in the us could provide greater revenue and profit potential for our company over a long period of time compared to licensing  partnering or the sale of these technology platforms 
we intend to continue to expand our sales force  and our clinical specialist team  to enhance our ability to market and sell our products to interventional cardiologists  interventional radiologists  and vascular surgeons 
pursue international markets through a mixed model of direct sales and distributors 
the international market potential for our endovascular products is large 
in europe and in other international markets  for example  few mechanical thrombectomy devices have been broadly commercialized 
our strategy of having a small direct team in germany enhances our ability to reach 
table of contents these international markets  and also assists us in conducting clinical studies abroad  a major part of our commercialization strategy to date 
in fiscal  we signed multiple new distribution agreements enhancing our geographic reach  particularly in eastern europe 
in fiscal  we intend to continue to expand our international distributor base 
enhance our product platforms 
we intend to continue to develop our products to enhance ease of use  improve effectiveness  and broaden the utility of the platforms 
we also believe we can develop additional proprietary products that will complement and drive the usage of our existing products 
evaluate strategic opportunities 
we continually evaluate strategic opportunities to add complementary products  technologies  and intellectual property  and may pursue selective additions that would enhance our product portfolio 
we may at any time evaluate other distribution methods for our products to enhance our revenue and profit opportunities 
due at least in part to their recent commercial introductions  our endovascular products have limited product and brand recognition  and limited usage to date 
we do not know if these products will be successful over the long term  or if they will be adopted by the physician community at rates that in turn generate enough revenue for us to sustain our investment in this business 
see item a risk factors our endovascular products were recently introduced in the united states 
if any or all of these products fail to gain market acceptance our business may suffer for further information 
thrombus removal product platform thrombus removal market overview thrombus removal products are designed to remove thrombus blood clots  either fresh or mature  from various vessels of the anatomy 
although historically  thrombolytics drug treatments to thin the clots  angioplasty and stenting have all been used to treat thrombus  mechanical thrombectomy devices and aspiration catheters are often useful to create rapid reperfusion renewed blood flow in occluded vessels  and to help to visualize the underlying lesion that needs to be treated 
in the dialysis market  arteriovenous grafts  av grafts used for vessel access  frequently develop clots that must be cleared on a regular basis 
mechanical thrombectomy devices use mechanical means to remove thrombus from a vessel  and may be suitable for situations where the clot burden is larger  more mature  or difficult 
aspiration catheters  using simple vacuum syringes to quickly and simply remove fresh thrombus  are not as powerful 
they are suitable for situations where a physician knows the thrombus was recently formed  and requires a quick and easy device to improve flow 
the thromcat thrombectomy catheter system the thromcat system is designed to remove more organized thrombus or blood clots from a patient  with an initial indication  in the us  for mechanical removal of thrombus in synthetic hemodialysis access grafts and native fistulae 
the thromcat device is a fully disposable system that incorporates heliflex tm technology to flush  macerate  and extract thrombus 
an internal rotating helix creates a powerful vacuum to draw thrombus into the catheter and then macerate it  while simultaneously flushing the vessel to aid in the thrombus removal 
the device is designed to be atraumatic  with no vessel wall contact of any moving parts 
the device has both coronary and peripheral approval in europe 
during fiscal  we completed a study of the device in coronary patients in germany 
hospital discharge results demonstrated over device success  patient safety  and desired device performance  
table of contents with approximately thrombus removal by volume 
the results of the study also showed improvements to timi thrombolysis in myocardial infraction flow measurements  and myocardial blush scores  based on the use of the thromcat system  with only of the patients needing temporary pacing 
over half of the patients enrolled had presented with an acute myocardial infarction mi or heart attack 
these results are promising and will be used as the basis  in part  for seeking a coronary indication in the us our company also plans to expand the technology platform  so that it has broader utility in peripheral and venous markets 
the quickcat extraction catheter the quickcat catheter is an aspiration catheter for the removal of fresh soft emboli and thrombi from vessels in the arterial system 
it has both fda clearance and ce mark approval 
the device is an easy to use  fully disposable aspiration system that rapidly removes thrombus from the body 
while there are several competitive devices of similar design  we believe that the quickcat device has advantages in deliverability and thrombus removal performance  based on internal test results 
chronic total occlusion platform chronic total occlusions market overview ctos are sometimes referred to by thought leaders as the last frontier of interventional cardiology 
by most definitions  ctos are complete blockages of a vessel that have been present for at least one month and are extremely difficult to cross with conventional guidewire techniques and  therefore  are difficult to treat and open 
it is estimated that as many as one third of the people diagnosed with coronary artery disease have at least one cto  and the presence of ctos is even more common with people who have peripheral vascular disease  which is estimated to occur in up to of such patients 
the most common failure mode for treatment of ctos is simply the inability to successfully pass a guidewire across the lesion into the true lumen of the distal vessel 
in general  physicians have advanced methodologies treating patients with ctos using regular guidewires  but these cases still represent some of the most challenging ones attempted 
success rates in crossing ctos have generally been increasing over time with better wires and techniques  but still vary from to 
with varying success rates and lengthy procedures  the ctos are usually either ignored  or patients are sent to surgery 
recanalization  or opening  of a cto is attempted in only to of patients undergoing coronary interventions despite the higher cto prevalence estimated at 
it has been shown that if ctos can be opened  the survival rates and quality of life for the patient may be significantly enhanced 
in one group of  patients with ctos  successful recanalization of the coronary vessel was associated with increased survival and a reduced need for more invasive surgical procedures over a seven year follow up period 
in a separate study  cto success was also associated with a relative reduction in late mortality 
these compelling statistics are the basis for an increasing interest by interventional physicians in attempting to treat ctos  despite the challenges presented 
the safe cross rf cto system the safe cross system combines optical guidance and radio frequency rf energy in a guidewire system to help physicians penetrate a cto that might otherwise be untreatable 
the system is designed to safely cross ctos using optical coherence reflectometry ocr technology as guidance and rf as an energy source to penetrate the difficult lesions 
the safe cross system is the only commercialized product that combines forward guidance with a crossing mechanism in a familiar guidewire configuration 
the system is designed to give the interventionalist real time feedback as to the proximity of the crossing wire to the arterial wall plus the capability to use rf power on the tip of the wire to assist in penetrating hardened 
table of contents material within the artery  thus facilitating safe and successful passage and placement of therapeutic devices for recanalization in native coronary and peripheral arteries 
in may  we acquired certain assets of ilt for million in cash 
ilt s lead product  the safe cross system  had received fda clearance in in the u 
s to treat both coronary and peripheral vessels and had also received ce mark approval for the same indications 
ilt had been selling the safe cross system in the us and europe until they substantially ceased operations in early as part of the transition of ownership  we are planning to re apply for ce mark approval  now that the manufacturing transition is complete 
we had previously identified the cto market as an area of high strategic interest and we plan to invest in certain internally developed product concepts to improve upon the acquired technology 
we believe the acquisition of the ilt assets was instrumental in gaining a foothold in the growing cto market and that the product line offers cross selling opportunities with our other endovascular products now being sold via our direct endovascular sales force 
we plan to enhance the design and ease of use features of the safe cross system with the objective of improving device success rates in the treatment of ctos 
the angio seal vascular closure device overview we pioneered the concept of vascular closure  having filed our first patent in for what today is the angio seal device marketed by st 
jude medical 
the angio seal device is a biomaterials based product  which acts to close and seal femoral artery punctures made during diagnostic and therapeutic cardiovascular catheterizations 
the device utilizes resorbable components to form a sandwich closure concept at the arterial puncture site to provide hemostasis stoppage of bleeding and speed the post procedure recovery process 
the angio seal device has been shown to have several advantages over traditional manual or mechanical compression procedures  including reduced time to ambulation and hemostasis  reduced staffing and hospital time  possible reduction in procedure costs  increased patient comfort  greater flexibility in post procedure blood thinning therapy and increased blood flow to the leg 
as measured by total revenue and number of procedures performed  the angio seal device is the leading product in the worldwide vascular puncture closure market 
the angio seal device has been sold in europe since  in the us since and was launched in japan in late there have been over nine million angio seal devices sold since its commercialization  making it one of the most successful resorbable biomaterials based medical products ever introduced 
the angio seal generated over million in revenue for st 
jude medical during our fiscal vascular puncture closure market overview the vascular puncture closure market consists of products developed for the purpose of closing and sealing of femoral artery punctures made during cardiovascular catheterizations 
recent estimates suggest that the current worldwide market for vascular closure technology exceeds million in sales annually  with much of the growth in recent years coming from the revenue growth of the angio seal device in both us and international markets 
current treatment options include manual pressure and device based therapy 
existing device based treatment options consist of biomaterial based devices  suture  clip  and staple based devices 
there are also many topical patch devices  which require adjunct manual pressure  and are used mostly for diagnostic catheterizations

we further intend to broaden the scope of our intellectual property and consider our core technologies to be critical to our future product development 
manufacturing we have developed unique manufacturing and processing capabilities for resorbable biomaterials 
we have our own capabilities in tool and die making  injection molding  extrusion  compounding  machining  model making and laser welding  which allow us to manufacture and engineer our developmental products on site 
for our collagen products  we have developed  and continue to expand  a closed herd sourcing infrastructure  which 
table of contents is helpful in allowing our collagen based products to be sold more broadly worldwide 
closed herd sourcing of bovine materials provides an additional level of risk management which is recognized by many regulatory entities worldwide as an important means of documenting the safety of the animal derived materials 
our methods and processes have allowed us to maintain edqm european directorate and quality of medicine certification  which documents the safety of our collagen products 
we believe our biomaterials manufacturing capabilities and raw material sourcing infrastructure provide a competitive advantage for our company 
in addition  we have established manufacturing processes and capabilities for our endovascular products 
these products are being manufactured in large quantities for the first time  and have presented challenges for our company 
during fiscal  we needed to perform multiple recalls related to our embolic protection platform  which we have since discontinued  and to our thromcat device which has since been relaunched to the market 
also during fiscal  we transitioned the manufacturing of the safe cross system to our facility in exton  pennsylvania 
these endovascular products are highly sophisticated products  which can be challenging to manufacture in the early stages of scale up 
we purchase most raw materials  parts and peripheral components used in our products 
although many of these supplies are off the shelf items readily available from several supply sources  others are custom made to meet our specifications 
we maintain safety stock levels of these custom materials to prevent any product downtime in the case of supply interruption 
in addition  we believe that  in most of these cases  alternative sources of supply for custom made materials are available or could be developed within a reasonable period of time 
the exception to this is our raw material sourcing for collagen  which would be extremely time consuming and costly to duplicate 
we have an in house quality assurance department that sets standards  monitors production  creates and reviews operating procedures and protocols and performs in process and final testing of sample devices and products manufactured by or for us 
facility in fiscal  we successfully transitioned our operations to a newly constructed  square foot facility in exton  pennsylvania 
the consolidation of all operations  from four separate leased locations into one headquarters building  maximizes efficiencies and facilitates our future growth 
construction of the company owned facility commenced in august  and was financed with cash on hand and from continuing operations 
in conjunction with the move to our new headquarters  we abandoned leasehold improvements from our previous facilities  which resulted in significant non cash charges to operations in our fiscal see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below and notes to the financial statements included in this form k for further information 
our new headquarters facility has been optimized for our company s unique businesses  and is equipped with state of the art equipment for developing and manufacturing biomaterials based products 
we hold iso and cmdcas certification 
certification is based on adherence to established standards of design  service  quality assurance and manufacturing process control 
our manufacturing facility is subject to regulatory requirements and periodic inspection by regulatory authorities 
research and development our research and development and regulatory and clinical staff consisted of individuals as of august  our research and development efforts are focused on the continued development of our endovascular platform and our biomaterials capabilities 
we incurred total research and development expenses of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  which included significant charges related to the discontinuance of the embolic protection platform and the transition to our new facility 
see item management s discussion and analysis below and notes to the financial statements for further information 

table of contents in addition to the resources dedicated to the product development process  we have an internal regulatory affairs and clinical management staff responsible for managing our clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approvals for our products 
our regulatory department also works closely with several of our customers to obtain regulatory approvals for their products in the us  the european union and several other countries 
sales and marketing in the us we have a direct sales and marketing team to market and sell the products within our endovascular platform 
as of august   we had individuals on the us sales and marketing team  including a six person marketing team  five members of the sales management team  three members of our customer service team and a total of sales representatives and clinical specialists throughout the us our us sales force experienced substantial turnover during fiscal early in the fiscal year  we hired a vice president of sales and marketing  who has focused on reorganizing and realigning territories  and upgrading the sales force 
these actions accounted for much of the turnover during the fiscal year 
our international distribution structure for our endovascular products consists of a small  dedicated sales force in germany  and distribution agreements covering most of europe and eastern europe  countries from the former ussr  and india 
we are dedicated to expanding our geographic focus and expect to have additional distribution agreements signed over the next months 
at august   we had nine individuals in our european sales and marketing team  which includes sales people and clinical specialists 
competition the markets for our current and proposed products are fragmented  intensely competitive  subject to rapid change and sensitive to new product introductions and enhancements 
we expect that the competitive environment for our products will become more intense as additional companies enter our markets and as new techniques and technologies are adopted 
our biomaterials and medical devices compete directly and indirectly for customers with a range of products and technologies produced by a wide variety of companies  as well as other processes and procedures that do not require the use of our products or those of our competitors 
many of our existing competitors  as well as a number of potential new competitors  have longer operating histories in these markets  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and greater financial  technical and marketing resources 
generally  we believe that the principal competitive factors for our products include the following the ability to obtain regulatory approvals  safety and effectiveness  performance and quality  ease of use  marketing  distribution  pricing  cost effectiveness  customer service  improvements to existing technologies  reimbursement  and compliance with regulations 

table of contents our biomaterials products compete with the products of many of the larger companies in the industry 
these products tend to be made by large companies  others by small companies under oem relationships and still others by start up  new technology groups 
we are not aware of competitors in the resorbable biomaterials medical device field that have the breadth of capabilities and size that we have and that also make their technologies available to other companies 
in many cases  our biomaterials based products are new concepts in the marketplace  and therefore the competitive landscape is still developing 
the angio seal device competes primarily with products sold by abbott laboratories  inc and medtronic  inc 
there are also a few other smaller competitors  some of whom recently gained approval for their devices such as accessclosure  inc in addition  cordis corporation  a division of johnson johnson  inc plans to introduce a new competitive product in the near future 
the mechanisms of action and designs of these products vary significantly and the products compete primarily on ease of use and clinical effectiveness 
while we consider the use of an angio seal device to be a preferred method of post procedure care  the majority of diagnostic and interventional procedures still rely on manual compression for post procedural care  which represents the primary competition for the angio seal device 
our competitors for our endovascular products include johnson johnson  inc  medtronic  inc  abbott laboratories  inc  vascular solutions  inc  boston scientific corporation  ev  inc  possis  inc  and spectranetics  inc  among others 
many of these companies have significantly larger sales forces and infrastructures dedicated to endovascular products than we have  which can make the competitive environment difficult 
our company attempts to compete based on the uniqueness of our products in the marketplace designed to meet important clinical needs for our customers 
government regulation medical devices are subject to extensive regulation by the us food and drug administration fda and by foreign governments 
the fda regulates the clinical testing  design  manufacture  labeling  distribution and promotion of medical devices 
noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in fines  injunctions  civil penalties  seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  failure to grant pre market clearance or pre market approval for devices  withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecution 
the fda also has the authority to recall or request repair  replacement or refund of the cost of any device we manufacture or distribute 
international sales of medical devices are subject to the regulatory agency product registration requirements of each country in which they are sold 
the regulatory review process varies from country to country 
many countries also impose product standards  packaging requirements  labeling requirements  price restraints and import restrictions on devices 
delays in receipt of  or a failure to receive  approvals or clearances  or the loss of any previously received approvals or clearances  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  reimbursement coverage must be obtained in some countries 
generally  regulatory activities for our biomaterials products are the responsibility of our customers  who are responsible for seeking fda and other government approvals to market the products 
for many of our customers  our company provides significant regulatory support  which includes the ongoing development and maintenance of master files with the fda 
master files contain important information relating to the specifications  manufacturing  biochemical characterization  biocompatibility and viral safety of our biomaterials products 
these files  in addition to our technical expertise  help our clients in their regulatory approval process for products incorporating our biomaterials 
the angio seal product line has received both ce mark and fda approvals 
st 
jude medical is responsible for all regulatory activities related to the angio seal device 
we maintain a master file with the fda containing important regulatory information regarding the collagen sponge component 

table of contents when human clinical trials of a device are required in connection with our new proprietary products and the device presents a significant risk  we must file an investigational device exemption ide application with the fda in order to commence human clinical trials 
the ide application must be supported by data  typically including the results of animal and laboratory testing 
if the ide application is approved  human clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients  as approved by the fda 
the conduct of human clinical trials is also subject to regulation by the fda 
sponsors of clinical trials are permitted to sell those devices distributed during the course of the trial  provided such compensation does not exceed recovery of the costs of manufacture  research  development and handling 
similar approvals are required to conduct clinical trials in foreign countries 
any products we manufacture or distribute pursuant to fda clearance or approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the fda  including product validations  recordkeeping requirements  post market surveillance  and reporting of adverse experiences with the use of the device 
as a device manufacturer  we are required to register our manufacturing facility with the fda and list our devices with the fda  and are subject to periodic inspections by the fda and certain state agencies 
the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act requires devices to be manufactured in accordance with quality system regulations which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements with respect to design  manufacturing and quality assurance activities 
labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the fda and  in certain instances  by the federal trade commission 
the fda actively enforces regulations prohibiting marketing of products for unapproved uses 
manufacturers are also subject to numerous federal  state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions  manufacturing practices  environmental protection  fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances 
we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations in the future and any failure to comply with such laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect upon our ability to do business 
employees as of august   we had employees  including employees in operations  employees in research and development and clinical and regulatory affairs  employees in finance and administration and employees in sales and marketing  including employees in europe 
all of our us employees are located at our new headquarters building in exton  pennsylvania  with the exception of sales representatives  clinical specialists and certain sales and marketing managers  all of whom are focused on our endovascular business 
we believe that our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain employees in all areas of our business 
corporate governance and internet address we recognize that good corporate governance is an important means of protecting the interests of our stockholders  employees  customers  and the community 
we have closely monitored and implemented relevant legislative and regulatory corporate governance reforms  including provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of sarbanes oxley  the rules of the securities and exchange commission sec interpreting and implementing sarbanes oxley  and the corporate governance listing standards of the nasdaq global select market nasdaq 
our corporate governance information and materials  including our code of business conduct and ethics  are posted on the corporate governance section of our website at www

our board regularly reviews corporate governance developments and modifies these materials and practices as warranted 
our website also provides information on how to contact us and other items of interest to investors 
we make available on our website  free of charge  our annual reports on form k  quarterly reports on form q  current reports on form k and all amendments to these reports  as soon as practical after we file these reports with the sec 

table of contents additional information for financial information  see the consolidated financial statements and the related notes as well as management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  which are included in this annual report on form k 
we have a single reportable segment for all our operations and business 
financial information about geographic areas can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks  uncertainties and other factors described below  in addition to the other information set forth in this report  because they could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results  financial condition  cash flows and prospects as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock 
risks related to our business we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from the angio seal  which is manufactured  marketed and distributed by st 
jude medical 
under our license agreements with st 
jude medical  the angio seal is manufactured  marketed and sold on a worldwide basis by st 
jude medical 
two of our significant sources of revenue are the sale of components to st 
jude medical for use in the angio seal device and royalty income from the sale of the angio seal device to the end user market 
the amount of revenue we receive from the angio seal device depends  in part  on the time  effort and attention that st 
jude medical devotes to it  and on their success in manufacturing  marketing and selling the device worldwide 
under the terms of our licenses with st 
jude medical  we have no control over the pricing and marketing strategy for the angio seal product line 
in addition  we depend on st 
jude medical to successfully maintain levels of manufacturing sufficient to meet anticipated demand  abide by applicable manufacturing regulations and seek reimbursement approvals 
st 
jude medical can terminate the license agreement for any reason upon months notice 
st 
jude medical may not adequately perform its manufacturing  marketing and selling duties 
any such failure by st 
jude medical may negatively impact angio seal unit sales and  therefore  reduce our royalties 
we derive a substantial majority of our revenues from only three customers 
a substantial majority of our total revenues are derived from only three customers 
royalty income from and sales of components to st 
jude medical represented approximately of our total revenue for fiscal  sales of biomaterials products to arthrex represented approximately of total revenues  and royalty income from and sales of biomaterials products to orthovita represented approximately of total revenue for fiscal it is not possible for us to predict the future level of demand for our products that will be generated by these customers or the future demand for the products in the end user marketplace 
our customer concentration exposes us to the risk of changes in the business condition of any of our major customers and to the risk that the loss of a major customer would materially adversely affect our results of operations 
our relationship with these customers is subject to change 
if our biomaterials products are not successful  our operating results and business may be substantially impaired 
the success of our biomaterials products  depends on a number of factors  including our ability to continue to manufacture  sell and competitively price these products and the acceptance of these products by the medical profession 
in addition  regulatory approvals will be required before biomaterials products in development can be sold 
we will require substantial additional funds to develop and market our biomaterials products 
we expect to fund the growth of our biomaterials business out of our operating income  but this operating income may not be sufficient to develop new biomaterials products 
to date  we have relied on strategic partners or customers to 
table of contents market and sell our biomaterials products 
if we cannot attract third parties to work with us to distribute our products to the end user market  we will not be successful 
we depend on our customers to market and obtain regulatory approvals for their biomaterials products 
we depend on the efforts of our biomaterials customers in marketing their products that include our biomaterials components 
there can be no assurance that our customers end use products that include our biomaterials components will be commercialized successfully by our customers or that our customers will otherwise be able to compete effectively in their markets 
the markets for our products are highly competitive and are likely to become more competitive  and our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
the markets for our current and proposed products are fragmented  intensely competitive  subject to rapid change and sensitive to new product introductions and enhancements 
we expect that the competitive environment for our products will become more intense as additional companies enter our markets  and as new techniques and technologies are adopted 
our biomaterials and medical devices compete directly and indirectly with a range of products and technologies produced by a wide variety of companies  as well as other processes and procedures which do not require the use of our products or those of our competitors 
many of our existing competitors  as well as a number of potential new competitors  have longer operating histories in these markets  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and greater financial  technical and marketing resources 
our biomaterials products compete with the products of many of the larger companies in the industry 
in the vascular sealing device market  our products compete with products sold by abbott laboratories  inc  and medtronic  inc  along with other smaller competitors and potential new entrants 
the majority of vascular sealing is performed through manual compression  which represents our primary competition 
our endovascular products compete with a large number of companies  many of whom have dedicated significantly more resources to research and development and sales and marketing than we have 
these companies include johnson johnson  inc  medtronic  inc  abbott laboratories  inc  vascular solutions  inc  boston scientific corporation  ev  inc  possis  inc  and spectranetics  inc 
our competitors may have broader product lines  which allow them to negotiate exclusive  long term supply contracts and offer comprehensive pricing for their products 
broader product lines may also provide our competitors with a significant advantage in marketing competing products to group purchasing organizations and other managed care organizations that are increasingly seeking to reduce costs through centralized purchasing 
greater financial resources and product development capabilities may allow our competitors to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements that may render our products obsolete 
competition faced by our customers could also have an adverse effect on our business for a variety of reasons  including that our customers may compete directly with larger  dominant manufacturers with extensive product lines and greater sales  marketing and distribution capabilities 
we are also unable to control other factors that may impact the commercialization of our components for end use products  such as marketing and sales efforts and competitive pricing pressures within particular markets 
our endovascular products were recently introduced in the united states 
if any or all of these products fail to gain market acceptance or we fail to successfully commercialize them using a direct sales force or other model  our business may suffer 
due at least in part to their recent commercial introductions  our endovascular products have limited product and brand recognition  and limited usage to date 
we do not know if these products will be successful over the 
table of contents long term  or if they will be adopted by the physician community at rates that in turn generate enough revenue for us to sustain our investment in this business 
market acceptance of our products may be hindered if physicians are not presented with compelling data from long term studies of the safety and efficacy of the products compared to alternative procedures 
we have no current plans to conduct such comparative studies 
in addition  demand for the products may not increase as quickly as we expect due to competitive and other factors  as was the case for our triactiv system embolic protection platform 
further  we have elected to use a direct sales model to sell our endovascular products but may not be able to successfully retain  recruit  develop and train our own sales force to sell and market the endovascular product platform 
in particular  we experienced substantial turnover with our sales force during fiscal  which we believe negatively impacted our net sales for our endovascular products 
prior to  we had no prior experience hiring  training and developing a sales and marketing force suitable for introducing new products into the very competitive endovascular marketplace 
we may consider partnering  licensing and other options for commercializing these products  but such options may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
if our endovascular products fail to gain market acceptance or we are unable to successfully commercialize them using a direct sales force or other model  our growth prospects may be diminished 
our management continues to actively monitor the performance of our endovascular product platform and to evaluate our allocation of resources to  and potential strategic and other alternatives with respect to  these operations 
if our products are not accepted by the medical community  or if our products are replaced by new technologies  our business may suffer 
the success of our existing products depends on acceptance of these products by the medical community  which we cannot predict 
the success of any products we develop in the future will depend on their adoption by our targeted markets 
we cannot predict how quickly  if at all  the medical community will accept our future products  or the extent to which our future products will be used 
if we encounter difficulties introducing future products into our targeted markets  our operating results and business may be substantially impaired 
in addition  new technologies and techniques may be developed which may render our current products  along with those under development  obsolete 
the loss of  or interruption of supply from  key vendors could limit our ability to manufacture our products 
we purchase many materials and components for our products from various suppliers 
certain of these materials and components are custom made for us  and we have no ready alternative source 
we also rely heavily on our closed herd sourcing infrastructure  for our collagen manufacturing  which cannot be readily replicated 
any loss of  problems with  or interruption of supply from  key vendors may require us to find new vendors 
we could experience production or development delays while we attempt to seek new vendors  if we can find them 
we may have problems manufacturing and delivering our biomaterials products to our customers 
the biomaterials industry is an emerging area  using many materials which are untested or whose properties are still not known 
in addition  many of our products are derived from natural materials  such as collagen  which can have varying properties and require careful controls 
consequently  from time to time we may experience unanticipated difficulties in manufacturing and delivering our biomaterials products to our customers 
these difficulties may include an inability to meet customer demand  delays in delivering products or quality control problems with certain biomaterials products 
while we believe our closed herd sourcing infrastructure provides us with an adequate risk management protection mechanism for preventing animal derived diseases from entering the human medical device industry  there can be no assurance that our measures with be adequate 

table of contents we have had product recalls that have resulted in significant expense and may result in other future expense or changes to product strategy 
we experienced start up production issues and component supply issues which resulted in product recalls  as disclosed under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
these product recalls caused an adverse affect to our net sales and operating results during fiscal in addition to lost sales directly resulting from recalls  and the direct expenses associated with such resolution  a recall may have other materially adverse  and potentially longer term effects  including a negative impact on our reputation in the marketplace with respect to these and other of our products  changes to future product marketing plans  changes to clinical trial plans  discontinuation of the recalled products and loss of key individuals on the sales team 
our use of hazardous materials exposes us to the risk of material environmental liabilities 
we use hazardous substances in our research and development and manufacturing operations  and  therefore  are potentially subject to material liabilities related to personal injuries or property damages that could be caused by hazardous substance releases or exposures at or from our facility 
decontamination costs  other clean up costs and related damages or liabilities could substantially impair our business and operating results 
we are required to comply with increasingly stringent laws and regulations governing environmental protection and workplace safety  including requirements governing the handling  storage and disposal of hazardous substances 
a substantial portion of our revenue is derived directly or indirectly from international markets 
st 
jude medical derives a significant portion of its angio seal revenue from international markets 
many of our other biomaterials products are also sold by our customers in international markets and we maintain a german subsidiary that sells our own endovascular products in markets outside the us our sales and royalties from international sales of the angio seal product line by st 
jude medical and our revenues from our other international sales are subject to several risks  including the impact of recessions in economies outside the united states  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  reimbursement policies  tariffs or other trade barriers  weaker intellectual property rights protection in some countries  fluctuations in exchange rates  potentially adverse tax consequences  and political and economic instability 
the occurrence of any of these events could seriously harm st 
jude medical s or our future international sales 
our business could be harmed if we lose the services of our key personnel 
our business depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel  including managerial  sales and technical personnel 
the know how and capabilities of many of our current employees is highly specialized and difficult to replicate or replace in short timeframes 
we compete for key personnel with other companies  healthcare institutions  and other organizations 
our ability to maintain and expand our business may be impaired if we are unable to retain our current key personnel or hire or retain other qualified personnel in the future 
our failure to expand our management systems and controls to support anticipated growth or integrate future acquisitions could seriously harm our operating results and business 
our operations are expanding and we expect this trend to continue as we execute our business strategy 
executing our business plan has placed significant demands on management and our administrative  operational  
table of contents information technology  manufacturing  financial and personnel resources 
accordingly  our future operating results will depend on the ability of our officers and other key employees to continue to implement and improve our operational  customer support and financial control systems  and effectively expand  train and manage our employee base 
we may not be able to manage our growth successfully 
any acquisitions that we undertake could be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value or harm our operating results 
we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses  technologies  services or products if appropriate opportunities arise 
the process of integrating any acquired business  technology  service or product into our business and operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures 
integration of any acquired company also may consume much of our management s time and attention that could otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business 
moreover  the anticipated benefits of any acquisition may not be realized 
furthermore  we may be unable to identify  negotiate or finance future acquisitions successfully 
future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
our future operating results are difficult to predict and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
our operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter in the past and are likely to vary substantially in the future as a result of a number of factors  some of which are not in our control  including ordering patterns by our customers partners the focus and resources that our customers partners place on developing marketing the products that we develop and manufacture  acceptance of the products we develop and manufacture in the end user marketplace  our ability to attract partners for our biomaterials products and technologies  our efforts to commercialize our endovascular products through our existing and developing sales force  our efforts to gain ce mark and fda approval for any future generations of endovascular devices  the loss of significant orders  changes in our relationship with st 
jude medical and other major customers  our establishment of strategic alliances or acquisitions  timely implementation of new and improved products  delays in obtaining regulatory approvals  reimbursement for our products  and changes in the competitive environment 
you should not rely upon our results of operations for any particular quarter as an indication of our results for a full year or any other quarter 
we could face adverse consequences as a result of the actions of a major stockholder 
according to a schedule d  as amended as of september   filed by ramius capital group  llc and certain of its affiliates  ramius beneficially owned approximately of our common stock as of the date of that amendment 
ramius has publicly and privately expressed opinions with respect to the continuation of our endovascular business  our use of available cash for a stock buy back  and other matters 
our 
table of contents business and operating results could be negatively impacted by any expenses incurred in connection with  management distraction caused by  and negative publicity resulting from  the actions of ramius and our responses to those actions 
risks related to our intellectual property if we are unable to protect our patents and proprietary rights  our reputation and competitiveness in the marketplace may be materially damaged 
we regard our patents  biomaterials trade secrets and other intellectual property as important to our success 
we rely upon patent law  trade secret protection  confidentiality agreements and license agreements to protect our proprietary rights 
although we have registered certain of our patents with applicable international governmental authorities  effective patent protection may not be available in every country in which our products are made available  and we have not sought protection for our intellectual property in every country where our products may be sold 
the steps we take to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to ensure that third parties will not infringe or otherwise violate our patents or similar proprietary rights 
we may be accused of infringing upon the proprietary rights of others and any related litigation could materially damage our operating results and business 
third parties may claim that we have violated their intellectual property rights 
an adverse determination in any intellectual property litigation or interference proceedings brought against us could prohibit us from selling our products  subject us to significant liabilities to third parties or require us to seek licenses from third parties 
the costs associated with these license arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties 
furthermore  the necessary licenses may not be available to us on satisfactory terms  if at all 
adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products 
any of these claims  with or without merit  could subject us to costly litigation and divert the attention of key personnel 
we do not own or control the use of the angio seal device trademark 
the term angio seal is a trademark of st 
jude medical 
all goodwill generated by the marketing and sales of devices bearing the angio seal trademark belongs to st 
jude medical and not to us 
should the st 
jude medical license agreements terminate  we would not have the right to call any of our products angio seal unless we purchase or license the trademark from st 
jude medical 
risks related to our industry we may face product liability claims that could result in costly litigation and significant liabilities 
the clinical testing  manufacture and sale of medical products involve an inherent risk that human subjects in clinical testing or consumers of the products may suffer serious bodily injury or death due to side effects or other unintended negative reactions to our products 
accordingly  the clinical testing  manufacture and sale of our products entail significant risk of product liability claims 
the medical device industry in general has been subject to significant product liability litigation 
any product liability claims  with or without merit  could result in costly litigation  reduced sales  significant liabilities and diversion of our management s time  attention and resources 
we cannot be sure that our product liability insurance coverage is adequate or that it will continue to be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
we face uncertainty relating to third party reimbursement for our products 
we could be seriously harmed by changes in reimbursement policies of governmental or private healthcare payers  particularly to the extent any changes affect reimbursement for catheterization procedures in which our angio seal products are used 
physicians  hospitals and other users of our products may fail to obtain sufficient 
table of contents reimbursement from healthcare payers for procedures in which our products are used or adverse changes may occur in governmental and private third party payers policies toward reimbursement for these procedures 
the decision by cms not to reimburse for treatment of asymptomatic patients suffering from carotid artery disease was a major factor in our decision not to continue to commercialize our embolic protection product line 
similar decisions  or changes to reimbursement policy  could harm our business 
our products and manufacturing activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation that could make it more expensive and time consuming for us to introduce new and improved products or cause us to withdraw products from certain markets 
our products and manufacturing activities are subject to extensive regulation by a number of governmental agencies  including the fda and comparable international agencies 
we are required to obtain the approval of the fda and international agencies before we can market and sell new products  satisfy these agencies requirements for all of our labeling  sales and promotional materials in connection with our existing products  comply with all applicable manufacturing regulations  and undergo rigorous inspections by these agencies 
compliance with the regulations of these agencies may delay or prevent us from introducing any new or improved products 
furthermore  we may be subject to sanctions  including temporary or permanent suspension of operations  product recalls and marketing restrictions if we fail to comply with the laws and regulations pertaining to our business 
we are also required to demonstrate compliance with the fda s quality system regulations 
the fda enforces its quality system regulations through pre approval and periodic post approval inspections 
these regulations relate to product testing  vendor qualification  design control and quality assurance  as well as the maintenance of records and documentation 
if we are found to be out of compliance with fda regulations  it could be costly and difficult to correct the non compliances and could seriously harm our business 
the fda and international regulatory agencies may also limit the indications for which our products are promoted 
these regulatory agencies may restrict or withdraw approvals if information becomes available to support this action  which could include actions based on sourcing of animal derived tissue 
risks related to our securities the trading price of our common stock is likely to fluctuate substantially in the future 
the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors  some of which are not in our control  including changes in our own forecasts or earnings estimates by analysts  our customers and licensees ability to meet or exceed the forecasts or expectations of analysts or investors  our ability to meet or exceed our own forecasts or expectations of analysts or investors  quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  
table of contents announcements regarding clinical activities or new products by us or our competitors  general conditions in the medical device industry  price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market  which have particularly affected the market prices of many medical device companies  and general economic conditions 
in addition  the market for our stock has experienced  and may continue to experience  price and volume fluctuations unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance 
as a result  you may not be able to sell shares of our common stock at or above the price at which you purchase them 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company 
if any securities litigation is initiated against us  with or without merit  we could incur substantial costs  and our management s attention and resources could be diverted from our business 
our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and delaware law may discourage an acquisition of our company 
provisions of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders

overview we provide an extensive range of products into multiple medical markets  primarily in the endovascular and orthopaedic markets 
the products we place into these markets include a range of resorbable biomaterials products  primarily for the cardiology and orthopaedic markets  as well as a line of products for the endovascular markets  including devices with applications in the thrombectomy and chronic total occlusion markets 
our revenues consist of three components net sales  which includes biomaterials and endovascular products  research and development and royalty income 
net sales biomaterials sales the sale of angio seal components to st 
jude medical and sales of biomaterial orthopaedic products  including products with applications in the orthopaedic markets  especially within sports medicine and spine product lines continue to be our primary source of revenue 
the table below shows the five year trend in our angio seal component and orthopaedic product sales fiscal year ended change fy vs fy in thousands sales of angio seal components orthopaedic products other products total net sales biomaterials we manufacture two of the key absorbable components of the angio seal for st 
jude medical  of their supply requirements for the collagen plug and at least of their requirements for the polymer anchors  under a supply contract that expires in sales to st 
jude medical  however  are highly dependent on ordering patterns and can vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
we experienced this variation in their ordering patterns throughout fiscal and have had exceptionally strong sales over the past four quarters due in part to anchor orders that exceeded the contractual minimums 
we expect sales of angio seal components to decline in fiscal as compared to fiscal sales due to the large volume of orders sold to st 
jude in fiscal under the contract and in comparison to st 
jude s end user sales for the comparable periods 
our net sales in the orthopaedic portion of our business are dependent on several factors  including the success of our current partners in the sports medicine and spine markets and the continued acceptance of biomaterials based products in these two markets  as well as expanded future acceptance of such products  and 
table of contents our ability to offer new products or technologies and attract new partners in these markets 
due to these dependencies  or other factors  sales to our orthopaedic customers can vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
endovascular sales over the last several years  kensey nash has devoted significant resources to bringing a family of proprietary endovascular products to market in the us and europe 
these products are focused in the emerging markets of thrombectomy and chronic total occlusions ctos 
sales of endovascular products increased to of total net sales in fiscal compared to of total net sales in fiscal see also discontinuance of embolic protection platform for a discussion of changes to our endovascular product line platform and how it impacted our results of operations 
royalty income our company also derives a significant portion of our revenue and profitability from royalty income from proprietary products that we have developed or co developed 
angio seal royalty income 
our company was the inventor and original developer of the angio seal vascular closure device angio seal  a device that reduces recovery time and enhances patient comfort following both diagnostic and therapeutic cardiovascular catheterizations 
st 
jude medical  inc has the exclusive worldwide rights for the development  manufacturing and sales and marketing of the angio seal  pursuant to an agreement which provides for a royalty to kensey nash on all end user product sales 
we anticipate sales of the angio seal device to continue a modest growth pattern  based on forecasted continued procedure growth  st 
jude medical s continued expansion in international markets  and its potential success marketing new generations of the product  such as the vip angio seal launched in march vitoss foam and vitoss royalty income 
since  we have partnered with orthovita  inc to co develop and commercialize a series of unique and proprietary bone void filler products  branded vitoss foam  the first of which was launched in march we receive a fixed royalty on orthovita s end user sales of vitoss foam products  which are targeted for use in the orthopaedic market 
in addition  in august we entered into an agreement to acquire the proprietary rights of a third party inventor of the vitoss technology for million the assignment agreement 
under the assignment agreement  we receive an additional royalty from orthovita on the end user sales of all orthovita products containing the vitoss technology up to a total royalty to be received of million  with  received in fiscal and million remaining to be received as of june  we believe the unique technology associated with the vitoss foam products and the growing orthopaedic market will result in the orthovita component of our royalty income becoming more significant over the next fiscal year and beyond 
we have other royalty generating relationships  none of which materially contributes to revenue at this time  but which we expect to provide increased revenue as the related products gain market acceptance and additional products are commercialized 
discontinuance of embolic protection platform on july  we announced a strategic decision to cease all activities related to our embolic protection platform 
as a result of this action  we have recorded certain charges in our fourth quarter of fiscal  including million in write offs of inventory  certain dedicated embolic protection equipment  and other assets 
additionally  knc offered its customers credits for unused embolic protection product  which totaled  during the fourth quarter of fiscal the total of these charges and credits is approximately million  or per share tax effected  and is presented within our results of continuing operations for the fiscal year ended june  additional charges related to severance and clinical trial closeout costs will be recorded in the first fiscal quarter of  and are expected to total approximately  
table of contents these charges represented a significant portion of our operating expenses in fiscal and therefore we have included the following table to show the amounts of the discontinuance of embolic protection charges included within each operating expense category of our financial statements for the fiscal year ended june  discontinuance of embolic protection charges fiscal year ended june  cost of products sold research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total discontinuance of embolic protection charges new facility in fiscal  we successfully completed construction of and moved our operations to a new facility  which resulted in significant facility transition expenses  including the acceleration of depreciation of certain abandoned leasehold improvement assets at our previous locations and moving charges 
the impact of acceleration of depreciation charges was million during fiscal in addition  we incurred moving costs totaling  in fiscal the transition to the new facility was completed in fiscal and accordingly no facility transition charges were recorded in fiscal these facility transition charges represented a significant portion of our operating expenses in fiscal and to a lesser extent in fiscal and therefore we have included the following table to show the amounts of facility transition charges included within each operating expense category of our financial statements for the fiscal years ended june  and facility transition charges fiscal year ended june  cost of products sold research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total facility transition charges stock based compensation the following table summarizes total stock based compensation expense  as a result of our required adoption of sfas r in fiscal year  within each operating expense category of our financial statements for the periods presented stock based compensation twelve months ended june  cost of products sold research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total stock based compensation expense 
table of contents critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in future periods 
we have identified the following as our critical accounting policies revenue recognition  accounting for stock based compensation  accounting for investments in debt and equity securities  inventory valuation and income taxes 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue under the provisions of staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition sab  which superseded sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
sales revenue 
sales revenue is recognized when the related product is shipped or the service is completed 
advance payments received for products or services are recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized when the product is shipped or services are performed  the timing of which could be subjective 
we reduce sales for estimated customer returns  discounts and other allowances  if applicable 
our products are primarily manufactured according to our customers specifications and are subject to return only for failure to meet those specifications 
royalty revenue 
royalty revenue is recognized as the related product is sold 
we recognize substantially all of our royalty revenue at the end of each month  in accordance with our customer agreements 
see note revenue recognition to the condensed consolidated financial statements included herein 
accounting for stock based compensation 
we use various forms of equity compensation  including stock options  nonvested stock grants  and cash settled stock appreciation rights  as a major part of our compensation programs to retain and provide incentives to our top management team members and other employees 
fair value of option grants are is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model that uses weighted average assumptions 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of our common stock  and other factors 
we use historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model  separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes 
the expected term of options is derived from historical exercise behavior and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on us treasuries with constant maturities in effect at the time of grant 
nonvested stock granted to non employee members of our board of directors  executive officers and other management is accounted for using the fair value method under sfas r 
fair value for nonvested stock grants is based upon the closing price of our common stock on the date of the grant 
cash settled sars awarded in stock based payment transactions are accounted for under sfas r  which classifies these awards as liabilities 
accordingly  we record these awards as a component of other non current liabilities on the balance sheet 
for liability awards  the fair value of the award  which determines the measurement of the liability on the balance sheet  is remeasured at each reporting period until the award is settled 
fluctuations in the fair value of the liability award are recorded as increases or decreases in compensation cost  either immediately or over the remaining service period  depending on the vested status of the award 
the expected term of cash settled stock appreciation rights has been determined in accordance with question of sec staff accounting bulletin topic  expected term sab  until such time that historical exercise behavior can be established 
revisions to any of our estimates or methodologies could cause a material impact to our financial statements 

table of contents accounting for investments in debt and equity securities 
in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas  we have classified our entire investment portfolio as available for sale marketable securities with secondary or resale markets and report the portfolio at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in stockholders equity and realized gains and losses in other income 
we currently have investment securities with fair values that are less than their amortized cost and therefore contain unrealized losses 
we have evaluated these securities and have determined that the decline in value is not related to any company or industry specific event 
we anticipate full recovery of amortized costs with respect to these securities at maturity or sooner in the event of a more favorable market interest rate environment 
revisions to our classification of these investments and or a determination other than the anticipation of a full recovery of the amortized costs at maturity or sooner could result in our realizing gains and losses on these investments and  therefore  cause a material impact on our financial statements 
inventory valuation 
our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
adjustments to inventory are made at the individual part level for estimated excess  obsolescence or impaired balances  to reflect inventory at the lower of cost or market 
factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand  rapid technological changes  product life cycle and development plans  component cost trends  product pricing  physical deterioration and quality concerns 
revisions to these adjustments would be required if any of these factors differ from our estimates 
income taxes 
our estimated effective tax rate includes the impact of certain estimated research and development tax credits and non taxable interest income 
material changes in  or differences from  our estimates could impact our estimate of our effective tax rate

biomaterials sales 
biomaterials sales were million in fiscal  a increase compared to million in fiscal biomaterials sales includes revenue recognized from products shipped as well as revenue generated from product development programs with biomaterials customers 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in sales of angio seal components to st 
jude medical  which were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a increase despite a  volume discount on sales in fiscal collagen plug component sales were million  an increase of and sales of the anchor component were million  an increase of as we were asked to supplement st 
jude medical s production at rates greater than 
additionally  orthopaedic sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the orthopaedic sales growth was primarily the result of sales to orthovita of million  which represented an increase of million  or  from the prior fiscal year  as well as a million increase in sales to zimmer and other new customers

costs of products sold for fiscal included million of facility transition charges 
the remaining change in cost of products sold was an increase of million in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to the increase in units sold  but was also affected by production scrap and shop order variances on the embolic protection devices where attempts were made to rectify the issues relating to a recall conducted during the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year 
these costs were incurred after the announcement of the recall of our embolic protection devices  but prior to the decision for discontinuance 
as we look ahead to fiscal  we believe that continuing higher volumes  process improvements and process automation will lead to further improvement of the gross margin on sales 
research and development expense

in fiscal  we commenced and completed a european study for the thromcat device in the native coronary anatomy and initiated enrollment in our us and european proguard trial carotid pivotal trial for the triactiv proguard device in the carotid anatomy 
due to the discontinuation of the embolic protection platform  the proguard trial has since been cancelled 
we expect to incur close out costs associated with the proguard trial in the first quarter of fiscal research and development expenses were and of total revenues for the fiscal year ended and  respectively 
we believe research and development expenditures in total and as a percentage of revenue

net interest income 
interest income increased by to million for fiscal from million for fiscal although there was a decrease in our average cash and investment balance during fiscal over fiscal  the decrease was more then offset by higher interest rates

we plan to draw the remaining balance on or before the expiration of the draw period on november  although we believe our cash and investment balances will also be sufficient on a longer term basis  that sufficiency will depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our existing and future products  the successful commercialization of products in development  the costs associated with that commercialization  progress in our product development efforts  the magnitude and scope of such efforts  the cost and timing of our efforts to expand our manufacturing  sales  and marketing capabilities  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  and the development of strategic alliances for the marketing of certain of our products 
the terms of any future equity financing we undertake may be dilutive to our stockholders and the terms of any debt financing may contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to pursue certain courses of action 
our ability to obtain financing is dependent on the status of our future business prospects  as well as conditions
