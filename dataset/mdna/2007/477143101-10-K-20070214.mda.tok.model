we slowed our aircraft delivery schedule during by deferring airbus a aircraft from through to through and adjusting our embraer deliveries from an average of aircraft per year from to to an average of aircraft per year through as of december   our firm aircraft orders consisted of airbus a aircraft and embraer aircraft  plus options for an additional airbus a aircraft and embraer aircraft 
our growth in was focused on expanding our network in medium and short haul markets from three of our focus cities new york  boston and washington  dc during  we commenced service to new destinations and  in january  we began service to o hare international airport in chicago  illinois 
in march  we plan to begin service from westchester county airport in white plains  new york to florida and  in may  we plan to begin service to san francisco international airport from john f 
kennedy international airport  or jfk 
our growth plan includes maintaining appropriate liquidity levels  a commitment to cost control and low cost carrier spending practices  improved revenue management  and enhancing the jetblue experience for our customers 
in  our cost control efforts were focused on improving aircraft fuel consumption rates  reducing our discretionary spending and staffing more efficiently in all aspects of our operations 
we had full time equivalent employees per aircraft at december   a decrease from we also improved our liquidity position during through the proceeds from the financing of previously unsecured owned property and the sale of five older airbus a aircraft 
in  we reduced the number of seats on our airbus a aircraft from to  which in addition to the added benefit to our customers  should reduce fuel consumption due to less weight from passengers  baggage and equipment  and require one less onboard flight attendant 
we derive our revenue primarily from transporting passengers on our aircraft 
passenger revenue was of our operating revenues for the year ended december  revenues generated from international routes  excluding puerto rico  accounted for of our total passenger revenues in because all of our fares are nonrefundable  revenue is recognized either when the transportation is provided or after the ticket or customer credit expires 
we measure capacity in terms of available seat miles  which represents the number of seats available for passengers multiplied by the number of miles the seats are flown 
yield  or the average amount one passenger pays to fly one mile  is calculated by dividing passenger revenue by revenue passenger miles 

table of contents we strive to increase passenger revenue primarily by increasing our yield per flight  which produces higher revenue per available seat mile  or rasm 
our objective is to optimize our fare mix to increase our overall average fare and  in certain markets  utilize our network to maximize connecting opportunities while continuing to provide our customers with low fares 
during  we modified our fare mix to achieve higher yields while relinquishing some of our load factor 
when we enter a new market  our low fares are designed to stimulate demand  particularly from fare conscious leisure and business travelers who might otherwise have used alternate forms of transportation or would not have traveled at all 
in addition to our regular fare structure  we frequently offer sale fares with shorter advance purchase requirements in most of the markets we serve and match the sale fares offered by other airlines 
other revenue consists primarily of the fees charged to customers in accordance with our published policies relating to reservation changes and baggage limitations  the marketing component of trueblue point sales and revenues earned by our subsidiary  livetv  llc  for the sale of  and on going services provided for  in flight entertainment systems sold to other airlines 
we have low operating expenses because we have high aircraft utilization  low distribution costs  a productive workforce and operate a new fleet with only two types of aircraft 
the largest components of our operating expenses are aircraft fuel and salaries  wages and benefits provided to our employees  including provisions for our profit sharing plan 
unlike most airlines  we have a non union workforce  which we believe provides us with more flexibility and allows us to be more productive  although we are subject to ongoing attempts at unionization 
the price and availability of aircraft fuel  which is our single largest operating expense  are extremely volatile due to global economic and geopolitical factors that we can neither control nor accurately predict 
sales and marketing expenses include advertising and fees paid to credit card companies 
our distribution costs tend to be lower than those of most other airlines on a per unit basis because the majority of our customers book directly through our website or our agents 
maintenance materials and repairs are expensed when incurred unless covered by a third party services contract 
because the average age of our aircraft is years  all of our aircraft require less maintenance now than they will in the future 
our maintenance costs will increase significantly  both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of our unit costs  as our fleet ages 
other operating expenses consist of purchased services including expenses related to fueling  ground handling  skycap  security and janitorial services  insurance  personnel expenses  cost of goods sold to other airlines by livetv  professional fees  passenger refreshments  supplies  bad debts  communication costs and taxes other than payroll taxes  including fuel taxes 
the airline industry is one of the most heavily taxed in the us  with taxes and fees accounting for approximately of the total fare charged to a customer 
airlines are obligated to fund all of these taxes and fees regardless of their ability to pass these charges on to the customer 
additionally  if the tsa changes the way the aviation security infrastructure fee is assessed  our security costs may be higher 
our operating margin  which measures operating income as a percentage of operating revenues  was in and in and was the third and second highest operating margin  respectively  among all traditional network and low cost major us airlines 
the airline industry has been intensely competitive in recent years  due in part to persistently high fuel prices and the adverse financial condition of many of the domestic airlines 
in late  us airways and america west merged and delta air lines and northwest airlines filed for bankruptcy protection 
the airlines currently operating in bankruptcy may emerge with substantially lower costs or consolidate with other carriers  either of which could allow them to compete more vigorously 
in the fourth quarter of  there were other reports of potential consolidation 
we are unable to predict what the effect of further industry consolidation would be for us or for the airline industry in general 
during  most traditional network airlines increased capacity on their international routes and decreased domestic capacity 
during the same period  some of our competitors  notably delta air lines and its discontinued low fare operation  song  shifted some of their domestic capacity out of markets where they had competed directly with us 
these developments  in conjunction with our shift 
table of contents of capacity from transcontinental flights to short and medium haul routes  contributed to our improved financial performance in our ability to be profitable in this competitive environment depends on  among other things  operating at costs equal to or lower than those of our competitors  providing high quality customer service and maintaining adequate liquidity levels 
although we have been able to raise capital and continue to grow  the highly competitive nature of the airline industry could prevent us from attaining the passenger traffic or yields required to be profitable in new and existing markets 
the highest levels of traffic and revenue on our routes to and from florida are generally realized from october through april  and on our routes to and from the western united states in the summer 
many of our areas of operations in the northeast experience bad weather conditions in the winter  causing increased costs associated with deicing aircraft  cancelled flights and accommodating displaced passengers 
our florida and caribbean routes experience bad weather conditions in the summer and fall due to thunderstorms and hurricanes 
as we enter new markets  we could be subject to additional seasonal variations along with competitive responses to our entry by other airlines 
given our high proportion of fixed costs  this seasonality may cause our results of operations to vary from quarter to quarter 
outlook for our focus in will continue to be on rigorous cost control and enhancing our revenue management processes 
through our recent efforts to optimize our fare structure and utilize global distribution systems that attract more business travelers  we expect the year over year upward trend in yield and rasm to continue through in addition  we are continuously looking to expand our other revenue opportunities  including charter services and marketing alliances 
we expect our full year operating capacity for to increase approximately to over with the addition of new airbus a aircraft and new embraer aircraft to our operating fleet 
in our efforts to create a growth plan that is sustainable  we may modify our rate of growth over the next few years through a combination of additional aircraft sales  leases  assignments and or delivery deferrals 
the impact of the shorter range embraer aircraft  which is expected to represent of our total estimated operating capacity  and utilization of our airbus a fleet for more short and medium haul flying is expected to result in a decrease over our average stage length 
while the shorter average stage length will result in higher unit costs  we expect the increase in unit revenues to be higher than the increase in unit costs 
assuming fuel prices of per gallon  net of effective hedges  our cost per available seat mile for is expected to increase by to over our operating margin is expected to be between and and our pre tax margin is expected to be between and for the full year 
results of operations the us domestic airline environment continues to be extremely challenging primarily due to high aircraft fuel prices and vigorous price competition 
our results were further impacted by the effects of overall lower demand for domestic air travel and security concerns related to the august terrorist threat in london 
however  due to capacity reductions in the us domestic market and the optimization of our own fare mix  average fares for the year increased over to  while load factor declined points to from the full year our on time performance  defined by the us department of transportation as arrivals within minutes of schedule  was in compared to in our on time performance was affected by our commitment to operate our scheduled flights whenever possible  along with operating at three of the most congested and delay prone airports in the us  as reflected by our and completion factors in and  respectively 
year compared to year we had a net loss of million in compared to a net loss of million in in  we had operating income of million  an increase of million over  and our operating margin was  up points from diluted loss per share was for and for 
table of contents operating revenues 
operating revenues increased  or million  primarily due to an increase in passenger revenues 
increased passengers resulting from a increase in departures  or million  and a increase in yield  or million  drove the increase in passenger revenue of million for the year although our load factor was points lower than that of last year  the increase in our yields more than compensated for this decrease 
during  we entered into agreements with four global distribution systems  which allow our flights to be available on their online travel reservation systems 
bookings through these global distribution systems have resulted in higher average fares  which have more than offset the increased distribution costs 
other revenue increased  or million  primarily due to increased change fees of million resulting from more passengers and increased adherence to related company polices and the marketing component of trueblue point sales of million 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased  or million  primarily due to operating an average of additional aircraft  which provided us with higher capacity  and a increase in average fuel price per gallon 
operating capacity increased to billion available seat miles in due to having more average aircraft in service 
operating expenses per available seat mile increased to cents 
excluding fuel  our cost per available seat mile increased in in detail  operating costs per available seat mile were percent changes are based on unrounded numbers

in  our average stage length declined to  miles due to increased operation of the shorter range embraer and capacity reductions in our east west markets 
a shorter average stage length results in fewer available seat miles and  therefore  higher unit costs 
we estimate that more than half of the year over year increase in our total cost per available seat mile was attributable to the decrease in our average stage length and also was a significant factor of the increase in each component 
salaries  wages and benefits increased  or million  due primarily to an increase in average full time equivalent employees of in compared to and a million increase in non cash stock based compensation expense 
we recorded million of profit sharing in compared to none in cost per available seat mile increased as a result of stock based compensation expense and profit sharing 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  and related interpretations  or sfas r  which requires us to record the fair value of stock options granted under our stock incentive plan and purchase rights issued under our stock purchase plan 
because we elected to use the modified prospective transition method  results for prior periods have not been restated 
at december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested share based compensation arrangements granted under all of our equity compensation plans 
we expect to recognize that cost over the remaining vesting period of five years 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the adoption of this accounting standard 

table of contents aircraft fuel expense increased  or million  due to million more gallons of aircraft fuel consumed resulting in million of additional fuel expense and a increase in average fuel cost per gallon  or million 
aircraft fuel prices remained at or near historically high levels in  with our average fuel price per gallon at compared to for the year ended december  our fuel costs represented and of our operating expenses in and  respectively 
our fuel consumption per block hour decreased due to utilization of the lighter embraer aircraft and various fuel conservation initiatives 
based on our expected fuel volume for  a 
per gallon increase in the cost of aircraft fuel would increase our annual fuel expense by approximately million 
cost per available seat mile increased primarily due to the increase in average fuel cost per gallon 
landing fees and other rents increased  or million  due to a increase in departures over and increased airport rents associated with opening new cities in cost per available seat mile increased due to ground rents associated with our new terminal under construction at jfk 
depreciation and amortization increased  or million  primarily due to having an average of owned and capital leased aircraft in compared to in and the associated depreciation of our seven gate temporary facility at jfk  which was placed into service in june cost per available seat mile increased primarily due to our temporary facility at jfk  partially offset by a lower percentage of our fleet being owned or under capital lease

we book the majority of our reservations through a combination of our website and our agents and in  respectively 
maintenance materials and repairs increased  or million  due to more average operating aircraft in compared to and a gradual aging of our fleet 
cost per available seat mile increased year over year due primarily to operating under airframe parts maintenance third party contracts in  one time warranty coverage on our engines in and outsourced line maintenance for the new cities we opened in maintenance costs are expected to increase significantly as our fleet ages 
other operating expenses increased  or million  due to higher variable costs associated with increased capacity and number of passengers served 
cost per available seat mile decreased due primarily to million in gains related to the sale of five airbus a aircraft in and the write off of million in development costs related to a maintenance and inventory tracking system in other income expense 
interest expense increased primarily due to having additional debt or capital lease financed aircraft  financing related to new maintenance and training facilities  financing of previously unsecured property and interest on our convertible debentures  resulting in million of additional interest expense  and higher interest rates  which resulted in million of additional interest expense 
interest expense also includes million related to our construction obligation for our new terminal at jfk and represented the majority of the million increase in capitalized interest  with the remainder attributable to higher interest rates 
interest income and other increased  or million  primarily due to higher interest rates and higher average cash and investment balances in  offset by fuel hedge losses of million 
we are unable to predict the amount of accounting ineffectiveness related to our crude and heating oil derivative instruments each period  or the potential loss of hedge accounting  which is determined on a derivative by derivative basis  due to the volatility in the market for these commodities 

table of contents our effective tax rate increased to in from in our effective tax rate differs from the statutory income tax rate due to the nondeductibility of certain items for tax purposes and the relative size of these items to our pre tax income of million

excludes results of operations and employees of livetv  llc  which are unrelated to our airline operations and are immaterial to our consolidated operating results 
although we have continued to experience significant revenue growth  this trend may not continue 
we expect our expenses to continue to increase significantly as we acquire additional aircraft  as our fleet ages and as we expand the frequency of flights in existing markets and enter into new markets 
accordingly  the comparison of the financial data for the quarterly periods presented 
table of contents may not be meaningful 
in addition  we expect our operating results to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the future as a result of various factors  many of which are outside our control 
consequently  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be meaningful and you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and investment securities of million  compared to cash and cash equivalents of million and investment securities of million at december  the increase in our cash and investment balances during resulted primarily from proceeds received from several financings of our previously unsecured assets 
we presently have no lines of credit other than two short term borrowing facilities for certain aircraft predelivery deposits 
at december   we had million in borrowings outstanding under these facilities 
we rely primarily on cash flows from operations to provide working capital for current and future operations 
cash flows from operating activities totaled million in  million in and million in the million increase in cash flows from operations in compared to was primarily a result of the growth of our business  offset in part by the increase in fuel prices 
cash flows from operations in compared to declined due to higher fuel prices  partially offset by a increase in revenue passenger miles 
net cash used in investing and financing activities was million in  million in and million in investing activities 
during  capital expenditures related to our purchase of flight equipment included expenditures of million for aircraft and five spare engines  million for flight equipment deposits and million for spare part purchases 
capital expenditures for other property and equipment  including ground equipment purchases and facilities improvements  were million 
net cash used for the purchase of investment securities was million 
other investing activities included the receipt of million in proceeds from the sale of five airbus a aircraft and the refund of million in flight equipment deposits related to aircraft delivery deferrals 
during  capital expenditures related to our purchase of flight equipment included expenditures of million for aircraft and three spare engines  million for flight equipment deposits and million for spare part purchases 
capital expenditures for other property and equipment  including ground equipment purchases and facilities improvements  were million 
net cash used for the purchase of investment securities was million 
additional cash required for security deposits was million  of which million related to our lease for a new terminal at jfk 
financing activities 
financing activities during consisted primarily of the sale and leaseback over years of embraer aircraft for million by a us leasing institution  our issuance of million in fixed rate equipment notes to various european financial institutions secured by nine airbus a aircraft and one embraer aircraft  our issuance of million in floating rate equipment notes to various european financial institutions secured by two airbus a aircraft  our issuance of million in fixed and floating rate debt to various us and european financial institutions secured by eight airbus a aircraft  five of which were refinanced  reimbursement of construction costs incurred for our new terminal at jfk of million  the financing of previously unsecured owned assets for million  scheduled maturities of million of debt and the repayment of million of debt in connection with the sale of five airbus a aircraft 
in june  we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the sec relating to our sale  from time to time  in one or more public offerings of debt securities  pass through certificates  common stock  preferred stock and or other securities 
the net proceeds of any securities we sell under this registration statement may be used to fund working capital and capital expenditures  including the purchase of aircraft and construction of facilities on or near airports 
through december   we had issued a total of million of pass through certificates under this registration statement to finance certain previously purchased aircraft spare parts 

table of contents financing activities during consisted primarily of our november public offering of million shares of our common stock at per share  as adjusted for our december three for two stock split  raising net proceeds of million  the sale and leaseback over years of six embraer aircraft for million by a us leasing institution  the financing of airbus a aircraft with million in floating rate equipment notes purchased with the proceeds from our november public offering of series pass through certificates  our issuance of a million year fixed rate equipment note issued to a european bank secured by one airbus a aircraft  our march issuance of million of convertible debentures due  raising net proceeds of approximately million  the financing of flight training devices with million in secured loan proceeds from export development canada  the financing of a hangar and training center in orlando  fl with million in special facilities bonds  of which million was received by year end  and scheduled maturities of million of debt 
none of our lenders or lessors are affiliated with us 
our short term borrowings consist of two floating rate facilities  each with a group of commercial banks to finance aircraft predelivery deposits 
capital resources 
we have been able to generate sufficient funds from operations to meet our working capital requirements 
we do not currently have any lines of credit  other than our short term aircraft predelivery deposit facilities  and virtually all of our property and equipment is encumbered 
we typically finance our aircraft through either secured debt or lease financing 
at december   we operated a fleet of aircraft  of which were financed under operating leases  two were financed under capital leases and the remaining were financed by secured debt 
financing in the form of secured debt or operating leases had been arranged for seven of our airbus a aircraft and for eight of our embraer aircraft scheduled for delivery in although we believe that debt and or lease financing should be available for our remaining aircraft deliveries  we cannot assure you that we will be able to secure financing on terms attractive to us  if at all 
while these financings may or may not result in an increase in liabilities on our balance sheet  our fixed costs will increase significantly regardless of the financing method ultimately chosen 
to the extent we cannot secure financing  we may be required to modify our aircraft acquisition plans or incur higher than anticipated financing costs 
working capital 
we had working capital of million at december   compared to a working capital deficit of million at december  we expect to meet our obligations as they become due through available cash  investment securities and internally generated funds  supplemented as necessary by debt and or equity financings and proceeds from aircraft sale and leaseback transactions 
we expect to generate positive working capital through our operations 
however  we cannot predict what the effect on our business might be from the extremely competitive environment we are operating in or from events that are beyond our control  such as continued unprecedented high fuel prices  the impact of airline bankruptcies or consolidations  us military actions or acts of terrorism 
assuming that we utilize the predelivery short term borrowing facilities available to us and obtain financing for the seven remaining aircraft scheduled for delivery in  we believe the working capital available to us will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next months

includes actual interest and estimated interest for floating rate debt based on december  rates 

spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
amounts include noncancelable commitments for the purchase of goods and services 
the interest rates are fixed for billion of our debt and capital lease obligations  with the remaining billion having floating interest rates 
the floating interest rates adjust quarterly or semi annually based on the london interbank offered rate  or libor 
the weighted average maturity of all of our debt was years at december  in  we refinanced the debt on five of our airbus a aircraft and  as a result  eliminated all financial covenants associated with our debt instruments 
our spare parts pass through certificates issued in november require us to maintain certain non financial collateral coverage ratios  which could require us to provide additional spare parts collateral or redeem some or all of the related equipment notes 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants of our debt and lease agreements and of our owned property and equipment was collateralized 
we have operating lease obligations for aircraft with lease terms that expire from to five of these leases have variable rate rent payments that adjust semi annually based on libor 
we also lease airport terminal space and other airport facilities in each of our markets  as well as office space and other equipment 
we have million of restricted assets pledged under standby letters of credit related to certain of our leases  million of which will expire in late and the remainder at the end of the related lease terms 
our firm aircraft orders at december  consisted of airbus a aircraft and embraer aircraft scheduled for delivery as follows in each of and  in  in each of and  in  in and in we meet our predelivery deposit requirements for our aircraft by paying cash or by using short term borrowing facilities for deposits required six to months prior to delivery 
any predelivery deposits paid by the issuance of notes are fully repaid at the time of delivery of the related aircraft 
we also have options to acquire additional airbus a aircraft for delivery from through and additional embraer aircraft for delivery from through we can elect to substitute airbus a aircraft or a aircraft for the a aircraft until months prior to the scheduled delivery date for those aircraft not on firm order 
in november  we executed a year lease agreement with the port authority of new york and new jersey  or panynj  for the construction and operation of a new terminal at jfk 
the aggregate cost of this project is estimated at million and it is expected to be completed in late we are committed to making various payments under the lease  including ground rents for the new terminal site which began on lease execution and facility rents that are anticipated to commence upon the date of beneficial occupancy 
the facility rents are based on the number of passengers enplaned out of the new terminal  subject to annual minimums 
the panynj reimburses us for costs of this project in accordance with the terms of the lease  except for approximately million in leasehold improvements that will be provided by us 
for financial reporting purposes  this project will 
table of contents be accounted for as a financing obligation because we currently do not believe we will qualify for sale and leaseback accounting due to our continuing involvement in the property following the construction period 
minimum ground and facility rents for this terminal totaling billion are included in the commitments table above as lease commitments and financing obligations 
anticipated capital expenditures for facility improvements  spare parts and ground purchases for are projected to be approximately million 
our commitments also include those of livetv  which has several noncancelable long term purchase agreements with its suppliers to provide equipment to be installed on its customers aircraft  including jetblue s aircraft 
we enter into individual employment agreements with each of our faa licensed employees 
each employment agreement is for a term of five years and automatically renews for an additional five year term unless either the employee or we elect not to renew it 
pursuant to these agreements  these employees can only be terminated for cause 
in the event of a downturn in our business that would require a reduction in work hours  we are obligated to pay these employees a guaranteed level of income and to continue their benefits 
as we are not currently obligated to pay this guaranteed income and benefits  no amounts related to these guarantees are included in the table above 
off balance sheet arrangements none of our operating lease obligations are reflected on our balance sheet 
although some of our aircraft lease arrangements are variable interest entities  as defined by fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  or fin  none of them require consolidation in our financial statements 
the decision to finance these aircraft through operating leases rather than through debt was based on an analysis of the cash flows and tax consequences of each option and a consideration of our liquidity requirements 
we are responsible for all maintenance  insurance and other costs associated with operating these aircraft  however  we have not made any residual value or other guarantees to our lessors 
we have determined that we hold a variable interest in  but are not the primary beneficiary of  certain pass through trusts which are the purchasers of equipment notes issued by us to finance the acquisition of new aircraft and certain aircraft spare parts owned by jetblue and held by such pass through trusts 
these pass through trusts maintain liquidity facilities whereby a third party agrees to make payments sufficient to pay up to months of interest on the applicable certificates if a payment default occurs 
the liquidity providers for the series aircraft certificates and the spare parts certificates are landesbank hessen th ringen girozentrale and morgan stanley capital services inc the liquidity providers for the series aircraft certificates are landesbank baden w rttemberg and citibank  na we utilize a policy provider to provide credit support on the class g and class g certificates 
the policy provider has unconditionally guaranteed the payment of interest on the certificates when due and the payment of principal on the certificates no later than months after the final expected regular distribution date 
the policy provider is mbia insurance corporation a subsidiary of mbia  inc 
financial information for the parent company of the policy provider is available at the sec s website at http www 
sec 
gov or at the sec s public reference room in washington  dc we have also made certain guarantees and indemnities to other unrelated parties that are not reflected on our balance sheet  which we believe will not have a significant impact on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
we have no other off balance sheet arrangements 
see notes  and to our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our variable interests and other contingencies  including guarantees and indemnities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and judgments to develop amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
we maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the 
table of contents appropriateness of the estimates that are required to prepare our financials statements 
we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable  however  actual results and the timing of recognition of such amounts could differ from those estimates 
in addition  estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the policies and estimates discussed below have been reviewed with our independent registered public accounting firm and with the audit committee of our board of directors 
for a discussion of these and other accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
passenger revenue 
passenger ticket sales are initially recorded as a component of air traffic liability 
revenue is recognized when transportation is provided or when a ticket or customer credit expires  as all of our tickets are non refundable 
upon payment of a change fee  we provide our customers with a credit that is recorded in air traffic liability  which expires months from the date of scheduled travel if not used 
accounting for long lived assets 
in accounting for long lived assets  we make estimates about the expected useful lives  projected residual values and the potential for impairment 
in estimating useful lives and residual values of our aircraft  we have relied upon actual industry experience with the same or similar aircraft types and our anticipated utilization of the aircraft 
changing market prices of new and used aircraft  government regulations and changes in our maintenance program or operations could result in changes to these estimates 
the amortization of our purchased technology  which resulted from our acquisition of livetv in  is based on the average number of aircraft in service and expected to be in service as of the date of their acquisition 
this method results in an increasing annual expense through when the last of these aircraft are expected to be placed into service and is adjusted to reflect changes in our contractual delivery schedule 
our long lived assets are evaluated for impairment at least annually or when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired 
indicators include operating or cash flow losses  significant decreases in market value or changes in technology 
as our assets are all relatively new and we continue to have positive cash flow  we have not identified any significant impairments related to our long lived assets at this time 
stock based compensation 
the adoption of sfas r in required the recording of stock based compensation expense for issuances under our stock purchase plan and stock option plan over their requisite service period using a fair value approach similar to the pro forma disclosure requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas we use a black scholes merton option pricing model to estimate the fair value of share based awards under sfas r  which is the same valuation technique we previously used for pro forma disclosures under sfas the black scholes merton option pricing model incorporates various and highly subjective assumptions 
we estimate the expected term of options granted using an implied life derived from the results of a lattice model  which incorporates our historical exercise and post vesting cancellation patterns  which we believe are representative of future behavior 
the expected term for our employee stock purchase plan valuation is based on the length of each purchase period as measured at the beginning of the offering period 
we estimate the expected volatility of our common stock at the grant date using a blend of historical volatility of our common stock and implied volatility of two year publicly traded options on our common stock as of the option grant date 
our decision to use a blend of historical and implied volatility was based upon the volume of actively traded options on our common stock and our belief that historical volatility alone may not be completely representative of future stock price trends 
regardless of the method selected  significant judgment is required for some of the valuation variables 
the most significant of these is the volatility of our common stock and the estimated term over which our stock options will be outstanding 
the valuation calculation is sensitive to even slight changes in these estimates 

table of contents although there was no impact to our overall cash flows  the adoption of sfas r did have a significant impact on our results of operations 
most of the stock based compensation expense recorded in related to our stock purchase plan and stock options granted in  as we accelerated the vesting of million outstanding stock options in december lease accounting 
we operate airport facilities  offices buildings and aircraft under operating leases with minimum lease payments associated with these agreements recognized as rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term 
within the provisions of certain leases there are minimum escalations in payments over the base lease term  as well as renewal periods 
the effects of the escalations have been reflected in rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease term  which includes renewal periods when it is deemed to be reasonably assured that we would incur an economic penalty for not renewing 
the amortization period for leasehold improvements is the term used in calculating straight line rent expense or their estimated economic life  whichever is shorter 
had different conclusions been reached with respect to the lease term and related renewal periods  different amounts of amortization and rent expense would have been reported 
derivative instruments used for aircraft fuel 
we utilize financial derivative instruments to manage the risk of changing aircraft fuel prices 
we do not purchase or hold any derivative instrument for trading purposes 
at december   we had a million liability related to the net fair value of our derivative instruments 
since the majority of our financial derivative instruments are not traded on a market exchange  their fair values are estimated  with the assistance of third parties  through the use of present value methods or standard option value models  with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets 
when possible  we designate these instruments as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes  as defined by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or sfas  which permits the deferral of the effective portions of gains or losses until contract settlement 
sfas is a complex accounting standard  requiring that we develop and maintain a significant amount of documentation related to our fuel hedging program and strategy  statistical analysis supporting a highly correlated relationship between the underlying commodity in the derivative financial instrument and the risk being hedged ie aircraft fuel on both a historical and prospective basis and cash flow designation for each hedging transaction executed  to be developed concurrently with the hedging transaction 
this documentation requires that we estimate forward aircraft fuel prices since there is no reliable forward market for aircraft fuel 
these prices are developed through the observation of similar commodity futures prices  such as crude oil and or heating oil  and adjusted based on variations to those like commodities 
historically  our hedges have settled within months  therefore  the deferred effective portions of gains and losses have been recognized into earnings over a relatively short period of time 
frequent flyer accounting 
we utilize a number of estimates in accounting for our trueblue customer loyalty program  which are consistent with industry practices 
we record a liability  which was million as of december   for the estimated incremental cost of providing free travel awards  including an estimate for partially earned awards 
the estimated cost includes incremental fuel  insurance  passenger food and supplies  and reservation costs 
in estimating the liability  we currently assume that of earned awards will be redeemed and that of our outstanding points will ultimately result in awards 
periodically  we evaluate our assumptions for appropriateness  including comparison of the cost estimates to actual costs incurred as well as the expiration and redemption assumptions to actual experience 
changes in the minimum award levels or in the lives of the awards would also require us to reevaluate the liability  potentially resulting in a significant impact in the year of change as well as in future years 
we also sell trueblue points to participating partners 
revenue from these sales is allocated between passenger revenues and other revenues 
the amount attributable to passenger revenue is determined based on the fair value of transportation expected to be provided when awards are redeemed and is recognized when travel is provided 
total sales proceeds in excess of the estimated transportation fair value is recognized at the time of sale 
deferred revenue was million at december  
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes to the price of fuel and interest rates as discussed below 
the sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on the overall economic activity  nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes 
variable rate leases are not considered market sensitive financial instruments and  therefore  are not included in the interest rate sensitivity analysis below 
actual results may differ 
see notes  and to our consolidated financial statements for accounting policies and additional information 
aircraft fuel 
our results of operations are affected by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel 
to manage the price risk  we use crude or heating oil option contracts or swap agreements 
market risk is estimated as a hypothetical increase in the december  cost per gallon of fuel 
based on projected fuel consumption  such an increase would result in an increase to aircraft fuel expense of approximately million in  compared to an estimated million for measured as of december  as of december   we had hedged approximately of our projected fuel requirements 
all hedge contracts existing at december  settle by the end of interest 
our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on interest expense from variable rate debt instruments and on interest income generated from our cash and investment balances 
the interest rate is fixed for billion of our debt and capital lease obligations  with the remaining billion having floating interest rates 
if interest rates average higher in than they did during  our interest expense would increase by approximately million  compared to an estimated million for measured as of december  if interest rates average lower in than they did during  our interest income from cash and investment balances would decrease by approximately million  compared to million for measured as of december  these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our variable rate debt  cash equivalents and investment securities balances at december  and fixed rate debt 
on december   our million aggregate principal amount of convertible debt had a total estimated fair value of million  based on quoted market prices 
if interest rates were higher than the stated rate  the fair value of this debt would have been million as of december
