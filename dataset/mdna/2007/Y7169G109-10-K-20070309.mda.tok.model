index to financial statements item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this filing 
executive overview we are an international provider of dry bulk marine transportation services that was incorporated in the marshall islands on january  and began operations in april as of december   we owned and operated a total fleet of vessels  consisting of panamax vessels  kamsarmax vessels and capesize vessels 
of these vessels  we acquired in and the remaining in in addition  a panamax vessel and a kamsarmax vessel that we had agreed to purchase have been delivered subsequent to the end of the period covered by this report 
we are currently contracted to purchase additional kamsarmaxes and additional capesize vessels  all of which are expected to be delivered by april our dry bulk carriers transport a variety of cargoes including coal  iron ore and grain 
as of december   our fleet had a combined carrying capacity of approximately  deadweight tons dwt and a dwt weighted average age of approximately years 
upon delivery of the remaining vessels  we expect our fleet to have a combined carrying capacity of  dwt and a dwt weighted average age of approximately years 
results of operations we began operations in and therefore cannot present a meaningful comparison of our results of operations for the period from january  inception to december  with results from a prior year 
accordingly  we have described below a comparison of our results of operations for the year ended december  to the period from january  inception to december  charters we generate revenues by charging customers for the transportation of dry bulk cargo using our vessels 
all our vessels are currently employed under time charters to well established and reputable charterers 
one vessel  barbara  is fixed on a variable rate time charter  in which the charter hire is tied to prevailing spot rates 
a time charter is a contract for the use of a vessel for a specific period of time during which the charterer pays substantially all of the voyage expenses  including port and canal charges and the cost of bunkers  but the vessel owner pays the vessel operating expenses 
in addition  we may employ vessels in the spot market 
under a spot market charter  the vessel owner pays both the voyage expenses less specified amounts covered by the voyage charterer and the vessel operating expenses 
vessels operating in the spot charter market generate revenues that are less predictable than time charter revenues but may enable us to capture increased profit margins during periods of improvements in dry bulk rates 
however  we will be exposed to the risk of declining dry bulk rates when operating in the spot market  which may have a materially adverse impact on our financial performance 
year ended december  in the year ended december   our fleet had a utilization of  compared to in the period 
we calculate fleet utilization by dividing the number of our operating days during a period by the number of our ownership days during the period 
the shipping industry uses fleet utilization to measure a company s efficiency in finding suitable employment for its vessels and minimizing the amount of days that its vessels are off hire for reasons other than scheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee  vessel upgrades  special surveys or vessel positioning 
our net daily revenues per ship per day for the total fleet for the year ended december  were  compared to  in the corresponding period in net daily revenue consists of our voyage and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements time charter revenues less voyage expenses during a period divided by the number of our available days during the period  net of commissions  including time charter amortization  which is consistent with industry standards 
vessel operating expenses per ship per day were  for the fleet in the year ended december   compared to  including per day in third party management fees  in the period 
vessel operating expenses include crew wages and related costs  the cost of insurance  expenses relating to repairs and maintenance  the cost of spares and consumable stores  tonnage taxes and other miscellaneous expenses 
to arrive at a per ship per day amount  we divide our total vessel operating expenses by the ownership days in the period 
all vessels owned by the company were employed under fixed rate or variable rate time charter contracts throughout the year ended december  one vessel  barbara  was deployed on a variable rate time charter  in which charter hire is tied to prevailing spot rates during the term of the charter 
as of december   our charters had remaining terms of between months and months 
we have rechartered the vessels whose charters expired subsequent to the end of the year 
we believe that these long term charters provide better stability of earnings and consequently increase our cash flow visibility to our shareholders 
logistics operations in december  the company formed a wholly owned subsidiary  quintana logistics llc  to engage in chartering operations  including entry into contracts of affreightment 
under a contract of affreightment  quintana logistics would agree to ship a specified amount of cargo at a specified rate per ton between designated ports over a particular period of time 
contracts of affreightment generally do not specify particular vessels  so quintana logistics would be permitted either to use a free vessel that it owned or to charter in a third party vessel 
year ended december  compared to period from january  inception to december  net revenues net revenues for the year ended december  were million after brokerage commissions of million  compared to million after brokerage commissions of million for the corresponding period in  an increase of 
in the year ended december   million of our revenues was earned from time charters  and million was earned from our quintana logistics operations 
in the period  all of our revenues were earned from time charters 
the increase in revenues during the year ended december  over the corresponding period in is primarily due to our operation of an average of vessels during compared to partial operations during the corresponding period of an average of ships 
our net daily revenues per ship per day for the total fleet for were  compared to  in the decrease in the period was primarily due to lower charter rates realized on some vessels that were fixed on charters during early  when charter rates were comparatively lower than rates later in the period 
commissions and other voyage expenses when we employ our vessels on spot market voyage charters  including those associated with our quintana logistics operations  we incur expenses that include port and canal charges and bunker expenses 
we expect that port and canal charges and bunker expenses will continue to represent a relatively small portion of our vessels overall expenses because we expect the majority of our vessels to continue to be employed under time charters that require the charterer to bear all of those expenses 
as is common in the dry bulk shipping industry  we pay commissions ranging from to of the total daily charter hire rate of each charter to unaffiliated ship brokers associated with the charterers  depending on the number of brokers involved with arranging the charter 
for the year ended december   our commissions totaled million  compared to million during the corresponding period in  an increase of 
commissions were higher for the year ended 
table of contents 
index to financial statements december  than the corresponding period in principally because we operated an average of vessels in  compared to an average of vessels during the period 
we incurred voyage expenses for the year ended december  of million attributable to our quintana logistics operations 
we did not incur any voyage expenses for the period because we did not conduct any of our chartering activities under quintana logistics until vessel operating expenses for the year ended december   our vessel operating expenses were million  or an average of  per ship per day  compared to operating expenses of million during the corresponding period in  or an average of  per ship per day  which included per day for third party management fees 
we took over technical management of all our vessels in the fourth quarter of  accordingly  technical management fees that were previously included in vessel operating expenses are now reflected in our general and administrative expenses 
vessel operating expenses include crew wages and related costs  the cost of insurance  expenses relating to repairs and maintenance  the cost of spares and consumable stores  tonnage taxes and other miscellaneous expenses 
the increase in total operating expenses for the period was primarily due to the enlargement of our fleet we operated an average of vessels during the period  compared to an average of vessels during the period 
per ship per day operating expenses decreased  however  by 
this decrease was primarily attributable to efficiencies gained associated with the enlargement of the fleet 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   we incurred million of general and administrative expenses  compared to million for the period  an increase of approximately 
our general and administrative expenses include the salaries and other related costs of the executive officers and other employees  our office rents  legal and auditing costs  regulatory compliance costs  other miscellaneous office expenses  long term compensation costs  and corporate overhead 
our general and administrative expenses for were comparatively higher than those in the corresponding period in because we operated an average of vessels during the period  compared to an average of vessels during the period 
in  general and administrative expenses represented of our net revenues for the period  as compared to for the corresponding period in the percentage reduction is principally due to operating efficiencies achieved by adding vessels to the fleet 
depreciation we depreciate our vessels based on a straight line basis over the expected useful life of each vessel  which is years from the date of their initial delivery from the shipyard 
depreciation is based on the cost of the vessel less its estimated residual value  which is estimated at per lightweight ton  at the date of the vessel s acquisition  which we believe is common in the dry bulk shipping industry 
secondhand vessels are depreciated from the date of their acquisition through their remaining estimated useful life 
however  when regulations place limitations over the ability of a vessel to trade on a worldwide basis  its useful life is adjusted to end at the date such regulations become effective 
for the year ended december   we recorded million of vessel depreciation charges  compared to approximately million in  an increase of 
we incurred significantly higher depreciation charges in than in the corresponding period in because we operated an average of vessels for  compared to an average of vessels in as a result of the delivery of vessels in and our agreement to purchase an additional vessels in  we expect our depreciation charges to increase on a period by period basis as those vessels are delivered 
time charter value amortization one of our vessels  iron beauty  was acquired in october with an existing time charter at an above the market rate 
we deduct the fair value of above market time charters from the purchase price of the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements vessel and allocate it to a deferred asset which is amortized over the remaining period of the time charter as a reduction to hire revenue 
with respect to iron beauty  this results in a daily rate of approximately  as recognized revenue 
for cash flow purposes the company will continue to receive  per day less commissions until the charter expires 
for the year ended december   we recorded million of time charter amortization charges  compared to million in this increase was attributable to a full year of amortization in the period compared to a partial quarter of amortization in if we acquire additional vessels in the future that have above market time charters attached to them  our amortization of time charter value is likely to increase 
drydocking we capitalize the total costs associated with a drydocking and amortize these costs on a straightline basis through the expected date of the next drydocking  which is typically to months 
regulations or incidents may change the estimated dates of the next drydocking for our vessels 
for the year ended december   amortization expense related to drydocking totaled million  compared to million for the corresponding period in  an increase of 
this increase was primarily due to the fact that we were amortizing drydocking expense for six vessels in  compared to two vessels in interest expense we incurred million of interest expense in  compared to million in the increase is primarily attributable to larger principal amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility as a result of the metrobulk acquisition in the period compared to amounts outstanding under our debt facilities in the period 
unrealized swap loss in the year ended december   we incurred million in unrealized swap loss attributable to our interest rate swap 
there was no corresponding loss in because we did not have any swaps in place at that time 
the loss on the swap is due to the decrease in libor  to which the variable rate portion of the swap is tied  under forward rate curves in finance costs fees incurred for obtaining new loans or refinancing existing ones  including related legal and other professional fees  are deferred and amortized to interest expense over the life of the related debt 
unamortized fees relating to loans repaid or refinanced are expensed in the period the repayment or refinancing occurs 
in  we incurred million in finance costs  compared to million in the corresponding period in of the million incurred in the period  million was attributable to the write off of unamortized portion of fees paid in connection with our old revolving credit facility 
of the million incurred in the period  million was attributable to the write off of unamortized fees paid in connection with the termination of the bridge loan and term loan facilities 
net income net income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the corresponding period in  an increase of 
the increase in net income during the year ended december  over the corresponding period in is primarily due to increased revenues in the period  resulting from our operation of an average of vessels during compared to partial operations during the corresponding period of an average of ships 
inflation inflation does not have significant impact on vessel operating or other expenses for vessels under time charter 
we may bear the risk of rising fuel prices if we enter into spot market charters or other contracts under 
table of contents 
index to financial statements which we bear voyage expenses 
we do not consider inflation to be a significant risk to costs in the current and foreseeable future economic environment 
however  should the world economy be affected by inflationary pressures this could result in increased operating and financing costs 
liquidity and capital resources cash and capital expenditures we satisfy our working capital requirements with cash generated from operations 
in  we financed our capital requirements with cash from operations  drawdowns under our revolving credit facilities  and the issuance of preferred stock and warrants 
in  we financed our capital requirements with the issuance of equity in connection with our initial public offering  cash from operations  and borrowings under debt facilities 
as of december   our cash balance was approximately million  compared to a balance of million in we incurred a substantial amount of debt during in connection with vessel acquisitions  resulting in a ratio of net debt to total capitalization of as of december   compared to as of december  we believe that cash flow from operations  drawdowns under our revolving credit facility  and proceeds from the ongoing exercise of outstanding warrants will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements for the next twelve months 
we intend to fund our future acquisition related capital requirements principally through borrowings under our revolving credit facility or equity issuances and to repay all or a portion of such borrowings from time to time with a combination of cash from operations and the net proceeds of potential equity issuances 
in order to consummate the acquisitions of vessels we have agreed to purchase  we must obtain additional financing 
we expect to obtain this financing by increasing the borrowing capacity of our revolving credit facility 
if we do not obtain this financing or do not obtain it timely  we may be in default under the acquisition contracts 
please read risk factors we may be in default under existing contracts to acquire vessels if we do not obtain additional financing 
our existing and expected debt obligations discourage us from incurring significant capital expenditures that do not immediately generate cash  such as entry into shipbuilding contracts for the purchase of newbuildings 
consequently  if we wish to incur such obligations  we may be required to arrange alternative financing arrangements 
the issuance of equity to consummate such transactions may dilute our earnings 
in connection with the acquisition or agreement to acquire vessels in  we issued a significant amount of equity  but will not realize the full benefit of the cash flows generated by the additional ships until the third quarter of consequently  the metrobulk acquisition was dilutive to our earnings in net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the period from january  to december  substantially all our cash from operating activities is generated under our time charters 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the period from january  to december  of the cash used in investing activities for the period  million was attributable to the acquisition of vessels during the period  including million associated with the acquisition of the metrobulk fleet  and million associated with the deposit paid on the iron miner 
in the period  nearly all of the cash used in investing activities was used to acquire the ten vessels purchased in that year 
net cash from financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the period from january  to december  in  we repaid a portion of the million outstanding under our old revolving credit facility with million in proceeds from the issuance of units  consisting of preferred stock and warrants 
we drew down approximately million under our revolving credit facility to repay the remaining portion outstanding under our old revolving credit facility and

in  we used million of capital contributions  together with million borrowed under a bridge loan in effect at the time  to acquire part of our initial fleet 
we used million of borrowings under a term loan facility to pay outstanding amounts under the bridge loan facility and to partially finance the acquisition of additional vessels 
we used the net proceeds of million from our initial public offering to partially finance the acquisition of vessels and to repay million outstanding under the term loan facility 
finally  we borrowed million under our old revolving credit facility to repay million outstanding under the term loan facility and terminate that facility and to finance the acquisition of vessels toward the end of dividends our policy is to declare and pay quarterly dividends to shareholders 
each year  our board of directors estimates a minimum annualized dividend  to be declared and paid quarterly  which is subject to reduction or elimination under certain circumstances  including restrictions under marshall islands law  covenants under our debt instruments  and changing market conditions 
for and  our board fixed a minimum annualized dividend of and  respectively 
in  we paid an aggregate of million in dividends  including dividends paid on common shares and an aggregate million dividend paid on the preferred stock during the period it was outstanding 
in  we paid an aggregate of million in dividends  all of which were common dividends 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments revolving credit facility general 
on july   we  together with our wholly owned subsidiaries  entered into an year  million senior secured revolving credit facility  with fortis bank nv sa as arranger 
this credit facility replaced our previous million revolving credit facility  which is described below

the full amount borrowed under the revolving credit facility will mature on september  commitment fee 
we pay a commitment fee of per annum on the undrawn amount of commitments under the credit facility 
this fee is payable quarterly in arrears

use of borrowings 
the company may use borrowings under the loan agreement to i refinance the debt outstanding under the old credit facility  ii partially finance the acquisition cost of seventeen new vessels that the company has contracted to acquire  iii finance part of the acquisition cost of other additional vessels  which acquisitions are subject to approval of the facility agent and the satisfaction of certain other conditions on the vessels  and iv finance up to million of working capital 
in addition  the company was permitted to draw down under the facility to pay down the old revolving credit facility 
we may not use borrowings to pay dividends 
events of default 
the loan agreement contains customary events of default  including nonpayment of principal or interest  breach of covenants or material inaccuracy of representations  default under other material indebtedness  bankruptcy  and change of control 
we are not permitted to pay dividends if an event of default has occurred or if the payment of such dividend would result in an event of default 
waivers 
under the facility  we were required to raise an additional million through the issuance of equity before we drew down on the facility to finance any of the last six vessels to be delivered in connection with the metrobulk acquisition 
on december   we obtained a waiver of that requirement for a period of three months  until march  as of february   the company had received sufficient proceeds from the exercise of warrants to satisfy this requirement 
in addition  the facility prevents us from drawing down on the facility to finance the acquisition of additional vessels prior to the delivery of the metrobulk vessels 
because we expect to take delivery of iron miner prior to the delivery of the final vessels from the metrobulk fleet  we received a waiver effective march  waiving this requirement and permitting us to draw down on the facility to finance the acquisition of iron miner 
old revolving credit facility our terminated revolving credit facility  dated october   was a secured  year  million revolving credit facility

off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any contractual off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that reflect significant judgments of uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we have described below what we believe will be our most critical accounting policies  because they generally involve a comparatively higher degree of judgment in their application 
impairment of long lived assets we use sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the standard requires that  long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles held and used or disposed of by an entity be reviewed for 
table of contents 
index to financial statements impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
when the estimate of undiscounted cash flows  excluding interest charges  expected to be generated by the use of the asset is less than its carrying amount  we should evaluate the asset for an impairment loss 
measurement of the impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset as provided by third parties 
in this respect  management regularly reviews the carrying amount of the vessels in connection with the estimated recoverable amount for each of our vessels 
vessel depreciation depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the vessels  after considering the estimated salvage value 
each vessel s salvage value is equal to the product of its lightweight tonnage and estimated scrap rate 
management estimates the useful life of our vessels to be years from the date of initial delivery from the shipyard 
secondhand vessels are depreciated from the date of their acquisition through their remaining estimated useful life 
however  when regulations place limitations over the ability of a vessel to trade on a worldwide basis  its useful life is adjusted to end at the date such regulations become effective 
drydocking costs we follow the deferral method of accounting for drydocking costs whereby actual costs incurred are deferred and are amortized on a straight line basis over the period through the date the next drydocking is scheduled to become due 
unamortized drydocking costs of vessels that are sold are written off 
fair value of time charter when vessels are acquired with time charters attached and the charterhire on such charters is above market  we allocate the total purchase price of the vessel between the vessel and a deferred asset equal in amount to the present value of the charter 
this present value is computed as the difference between the contractual amount to be received over the term of the time charter and management s estimates of the fair value of the time charter at the time of acquisition 
the discount rate reflects the risks associated with the acquired time charter 
the deferred time charter premium is amortized over the remaining period of the time charter as a reduction to hire revenue

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates effective july   we entered into a swap transaction with respect to our revolving credit facility 
because the revolving credit facility provided for variable rate interest  management determined that an interest rate swap would best protect the company from interest rate risk on amounts outstanding under its revolving credit facility 
this swap effectively insulates us from interest rate risk relating to the floating rates payable under the facility until december   as we are required to pay a fixed rate of  exclusive of spread due our lenders 
on december   the counterparty to the swap may exercise an option to lock our fixed rate at through june  if the counterparty does not exercise this option  we will be exposed to market rates at that time
