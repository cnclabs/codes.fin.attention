the overview is not intended as a summary of  or a substitute for review of  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation business carpenter is engaged in the manufacturing  fabrication  and distribution of specialty metals and engineered products 
we primarily process basic raw materials such as nickel  titanium  chromium  iron scrap and other metal alloying elements through various melting  hot forming and cold working facilities to produce finished products in the form of billet  bar  rod  wire  narrow strip  special shapes and hollow forms in many sizes and finishes 
we also produce certain metal powders and fabricated metal products 
in addition  ceramic products are produced from various raw materials using molding  heating and other processes 
our specialty metals segment includes the manufacturing and distribution of stainless steels  titanium  high temperature alloys  electronic alloys  tool steels and other alloys in billet  bar  wire  rod  strip and powder forms 
specialty metals sales are distributed directly from our production plants and distribution network as well as through independent distributors 
our engineered products segment includes the manufacture and sale of structural ceramic products  ceramic cores for the investment casting industry and custom shaped bar 
in july  we announced certain changes to our organization which management believes will allows us to better focus on the customer  end use markets and to reach our operational excellence goals 
the announcement included the key appointments of a senior vice president advanced metals operations and a senior vice president premium alloys operations 
these changes will impact the company s financial reporting related to segment information 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of the changes and expects that the segment information reported during fiscal will reflect the organizational changes discussed above 
the table below shows our net sales by major product class for the past three fiscal years in millions special alloys stainless steels titanium products ceramics and other materials tool and other steels total net sales 
table of contents unlike many other specialty steel producers  we operate our own worldwide network of service distribution centers 
these service centers  located in the united states  canada  mexico and europe  allow us to work more closely with customers and to offer various just in time stocking programs 
as a result  we often serve as a technical partner in customizing specialty metals or in developing new ones 
our sales are across a diversified list of end use markets 
the table below summarizes our estimated sales by market over the past three fiscal years

in addition to the united states  where the majority of our manufacturing exists  we have manufacturing facilities in the united kingdom  mexico  sweden and australia 
in fiscal  and  percent million  percent million and percent million of our sales were to customers outside of the united states  respectively 
we believe that our ability to be a product innovator in special material development and manufacturing is an important factor in the success of the company 
our strong commitment to setting new industry standards is evidenced by our specialty alloys research and development center  where teams work in such areas as physical metallurgy  analytical chemistry  materials characterization and process and systems development 
we have highly skilled engineering teams specializing in specific products at each of our operations 
as part of our overall business strategy  we have sought out and considered opportunities related to strategic divestitures  acquisitions  and joint venture propositions 
management has participated in discussions with other companies to explore potential terms and structure of such opportunities 
the company expects that it will continue to evaluate these opportunities 

table of contents business trends net sales  earnings  free cash flow and pounds sold for the past three fiscal years are summarized below in millions  except per share data net sales net income diluted earnings per share free cash flow pounds sold in thousands includes specialty and titanium alloys  stainless steel and powder materials our results of operations have improved significantly over the past three fiscal years largely as a result of favorable market conditions and our focus on lean and waste reduction  especially in the aerospace  energy and medical markets 
the key components of our business strategy are as follows a shift in product mix to higher value materials  improved margins from an intentional reduction in the sale of marginally profitable products  pricing products for the value delivered  expansion of sales in markets outside of the us  efforts to achieve operational excellence through our focus on lean and waste reduction 
specifically  we use the phrase lean and waste reduction to refer to eliminating or reducing non value added activities  process variation reduction  process control  work concentration  product flow based on specific customer quantity demand and constraint removal 
our lean and waste reduction philosophy applies to all aspects of our business  including product development  order taking and scheduling  manufacturing  logistics and administrative processes 
we value most of our inventory utilizing the last in  first out lifo inventory costing methodology 
under the lifo inventory costing method  changes in the cost of raw materials and production activities are recognized in cost of sales in the current period even though these materials may have been acquired at potentially significantly different values due to the length of time from the time the raw materials are acquired to the time the processed finished goods are sold to the customer 
in a period of rising raw material costs  the lifo inventory valuation normally results in higher costs of sales 
increases in the cost of raw materials have impacted our operations over the past few years 
we  and others in our industry  generally have been able to pass these cost increases through to our customers using surcharges which are structured to recover high raw material costs 
in the last several years  as raw material prices have escalated  surcharges have become an increasingly significant component of our net sales 
this has impacted our sales numbers and had a dilutive effect on our gross margin and operating margin percentages as described later in this discussion 
the formula used to calculate the surcharge is based on prices quoted on the london metal exchange lme for the previous month for the respective raw materials 
surcharge revenues  which are included in net sales  were million  million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively
