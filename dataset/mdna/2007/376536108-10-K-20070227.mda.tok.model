item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this form k 
overview we were incorporated under the general corporation laws of the state of maryland on february  primarily for the purpose of investing in and owning net leased industrial and commercial real property and selectively making long term industrial and commercial mortgage loans 
most of the portfolio of real estate we currently own is leased to a wide cross section of tenants ranging from small businesses to large public companies  many of which do not have publicly rated debt 
we have in the past entered into  and intend in the future to enter into  purchase agreements for real estate having triple net leases with terms of approximately to years  with rental increases built into the leases 
under a triple net lease  the tenant is required to pay all operating  maintenance and insurance costs and real estate taxes with respect to the leased property 
at december   we owned properties  and had one mortgage loan outstanding 
we are actively communicating with buyout funds  real estate brokers and other third parties to locate properties for potential acquisition or to provide mortgage financing in an effort to build our portfolio 
we conduct substantially all of our activities  including ownership of all of our properties  through gladstone commercial limited partnership  a delaware limited partnership formed on may   which we refer to as our operating partnership 
we control our operating partnership through our ownership of gclp business trust ii  a massachusetts business trust  which is the general partner of our operating partnership  and through our ownership of gclp business trust i  a massachusetts business trust  which holds all of the limited partnership units of our operating partnership 
we expect that our operating partnership may issue limited partnership units from time to time in exchange for industrial and commercial real property 
by structuring our acquisitions in this manner  the sellers of the real estate will generally be able to defer the recognition of gains associated with the dispositions of their properties until they redeem the limited partnership units 
limited partners who hold limited partnership units in our operating partnership will be entitled to redeem their units for cash or  at our election  shares of our common stock on a one for one basis at any time 
whenever we issue stock for cash  we are obligated to contribute the net proceeds we receive from the sale of the stock to our operating partnership  and our operating partnership is  in turn  obligated to issue an equivalent number of limited partnership units to us 
our operating partnership will distribute the income it generates from its operations to its partners  including gclp business trust i and gclp business trust ii  both of which are beneficially owned by us  on a pro rata basis 
we will  in turn  distribute the amounts we receive from our operating partnership to fund distributions to our stockholders in the form of monthly cash dividends 
we have historically operated  and intend to continue to operate  so as to qualify as a real estate investment trust  or reit  for federal income tax purposes  thereby generally avoiding federal income taxes on the distributions we make to our stockholders 
gladstone management corporation  a registered investment adviser and an affiliate of ours  serves as our external adviser  which we refer to as our adviser 
our adviser is responsible for managing our business on a day to day basis and for identifying and making acquisitions and dispositions in accordance with our investment criteria

we paid and fully accrued approximately  in taxes related to the gain on the sale  although the actual amount of taxes due will not be finalized until tax returns are filed 
we have been advised that the actual amount of taxes should be approximately  or  less than what was paid at closing  subject to final adjustments and federal canadian tax return review 
the mortgages associated with the canadian properties were assumed by the buyer at closing 
acquisition of building in satisfaction of mortgage loan in august  we ceased accruing revenues on our mortgage loan secured by an industrial property in sterling heights  michigan due to non payment 
we also placed the borrower in default and began pursuing available remedies under its mortgage  including instituting foreclosure proceedings on the property 
we obtained an independent appraisal on the security which indicated a fair value in excess of the outstanding principal balance and accrued  non default interest due under the mortgage loan at the time of default 
as a result of the fair value indicated in the appraisal  we determined that the loan was not impaired and a writedown was not necessary 
at the foreclosure sale on september   we were the successful bidder 
we accounted for the asset received as if the asset had been acquired for cash and recorded the real estate asset at approximately million on that date  which equaled the outstanding principal balance and accrued  non default interest due under the mortgage loan to us 
under michigan law  the borrower had six months from the date of foreclosure to redeem ownership of the property in exchange for payment of the bid amount plus certain other expenditures 
as part of the resolution of our claims against the borrower and tenant  the borrower formally waived its right of redemption and permitted us to take immediate possession of the property so that it could be leased to a new tenant 
on october   the original borrower with respect to the property waived its right of redemption to reacquire the property  confirming our ownership of the property 
we simultaneously executed a ten year  triple net lease with the new tenant  with one option to extend the lease for an additional period of five years 
the lease also has a provision whereby the new tenant may purchase the property from us within the first lease year for million  or in the second lease year for million 
the lease provides for annual rents of approximately million in  with prescribed escalations thereafter

investment advisory and administration agreements since inception  we have been externally managed pursuant to a contractual investment advisory arrangement with our adviser  under which our adviser has directly employed all of our personnel and paid its payroll  benefits  and general expenses directly 
our initial investment advisory agreement with our adviser was in place from february   inception  through december   which we refer to as the initial advisory agreement 
on january   we entered into an amended and restated investment advisory agreement with our adviser  which we refer to as the amended advisory agreement  and an administration agreement  which we refer to as the administration agreement  with gladstone administration  which we refer to as our administrator 
our board of directors proposed the amended advisory agreement to stockholders in order to provide what it considers to be more appropriate incentives to reward fund management  and our stockholders approved each of these agreements on may  the management services and fees in effect under the initial and amended advisory agreements are described below 
in addition  we will continue to pay our direct expenses including  but not limited to  legal  accounting  interest  tax preparation  directors and officers insurance  stock transfer services  shareholder related fees  consulting and related fees under the amended advisory agreement 
under the terms of the initial advisory agreement and the new amended advisory agreement  we are responsible for all expenses incurred for our direct benefit 
examples of these expenses include  legal  accounting  interest on short term debt and mortgages  tax preparation  directors and officers insurance  stock transfer services  shareholder related fees  consulting and related fees 
during the years ended december    and  the total amount of these expenses that we incurred was approximately   and  respectively 
all of these charges are incurred directly by us rather than by our adviser for our benefit 
accordingly  we did not make any reimbursements to our adviser for these amounts 
in addition  we are also responsible for all fees charged by third parties that are directly related to our business  which may include real estate brokerage fees  mortgage placement fees  lease up fees and transaction structuring fees although we may be able to pass some or all of such fees on to our tenants and borrowers 
in the event that any of these expenses are incurred on our behalf by our adviser  we are required to reimburse our adviser on a dollar for dollar basis for all such amounts 
during the years ended december    and  we passed all such fees along to our tenants  and accordingly we did not incur any such fees during these periods 
accordingly  we did not make any reimbursements to our adviser for these amounts 
the actual amount of such fees that we incur in the future will depend largely upon the aggregate costs of the properties we acquire  the aggregate amount of mortgage loans we make  and the extent to which we are able to shift the burden of such fees to our tenants and borrowers 
accordingly  the amount of these fees that we will pay in the future is not determinable at this time 
we do not presently expect that our adviser will incur any of these fees on our behalf 
management services and fees under the initial advisory agreement we were required to reimburse our adviser for our pro rata share of our adviser s payroll and benefits expenses on an employee by employee basis  based on the percentage of each employee s time devoted to our matters 
during the years ended december    and  these expenses were approximately   and  respectively 
we were also required to reimburse our adviser for our pro rata portion of all other expenses of our adviser not reimbursed under the arrangements described above  which we refer to as overhead expenses  equal to the total overhead expenses of our adviser  multiplied by the ratio of hours worked by our adviser s employees on our projects to the total hours worked by our adviser s employees 
however  we were only required to reimburse our adviser for our portion of its overhead expenses if the amount of payroll and benefits we reimbursed to our adviser was less than of our average invested assets for the year 
additionally  we were only required to reimburse our adviser for overhead expenses up to the point that reimbursed overhead expenses and payroll and benefits expenses  on a combined basis  equaled of our average invested assets for the year 
our adviser billed us on a monthly basis for these amounts 
our adviser was required to reimburse us annually for the amount by which amounts billed to and paid by us exceed this limit during a given year 
the amounts never exceeded the limit  and we never received reimbursement 
during the years ended december    and  we reimbursed to our adviser approximately   and  respectively  of overhead expenses 
management services and fees under the amended advisory agreement the amended advisory agreement provides for an annual base management fee equal to of our total stockholders equity  less the recorded value of any preferred stock  and an incentive fee based on funds from operations  or ffo 
for purposes of calculating the incentive fee  ffo includes any realized capital gains and capital losses  less any dividends paid on preferred stock  but ffo does not include any unrealized capital gains or losses 
the incentive fee would reward our adviser if our quarterly ffo  before giving effect to any incentive fee  exceeds  or annualized  the hurdle rate of total stockholders equity  less the recorded value of any preferred stock 
our adviser will receive of the amount of the pre incentive fee ffo that exceeds the hurdle rate  but is less than of our pre incentive fee ffo 
our adviser will also receive an incentive fee of of the amount of our pre incentive fee ffo that exceeds 
under the administration agreement  we will pay separately for our allocable portion of the administrator s overhead expenses in performing its obligations  including rent  and our allocable portion of the salaries and benefits expenses of our chief financial officer  chief compliance officer  controller  treasurer and their respective staffs 
the incentive fee was put in effect in place of our equity incentive plan  which we refer to as the plan 
in connection with the approval of the amended advisory and administration agreements  and pursuant to the approval of our board of directors on july   on july   we accelerated in full the vesting of all outstanding options under the plan  resulting in the acceleration of  unvested options 
also on july   we filed a schedule to and related documentation with the securities and exchange commission  or sec  which described an offer to then outstanding option holders to accelerate the expiration date of all of their outstanding options under the plan to december   which we refer to as the offer 
the offer was conditional upon its acceptance by all option holders on or before its expiration on august   and all option holders accepted the offer prior to that date 
all outstanding options under the plan were amended to expire on december  upon the effectiveness of the amended advisory agreement and administration agreement on january   the initial advisory agreement terminated 
critical accounting policies management believes our most critical accounting policies are revenue recognition including straight line rent  investment accounting  purchase price allocation  accounting for our investments in real estate  provision for loan losses  the accounting for our derivative and hedging activities  if any  income taxes and stock based compensation 
each of these items involves estimates that require management to make judgments that are subjective in nature 
management relies on its experience  collects historical data and current market data  and analyzes these assumptions in order to arrive at what it believes to be reasonable estimates 
under different conditions or assumptions  materially different amounts could be reported related to the accounting policies described below 
in addition  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgments on the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could materially differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition rental income includes rents that each tenant pays in accordance with the terms of its respective lease reported on a straight line basis over the initial term of the lease 
because a majority of our leases contain rental increases at specified intervals  straight line basis accounting requires us to record as an asset  and include in revenues  deferred rent receivable that we will only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease 
deferred rent receivable in the accompanying balance sheets includes the cumulative difference between rental revenue as recorded on a straight line basis and rents received from the tenants in accordance with the lease terms  along with the capitalized above market lease values of certain acquired properties 
accordingly  our management must determine  in its judgment  to what extent the deferred rent receivable applicable to each specific tenant is collectible 
we review deferred rent receivable  as is it relates to straight line rents  on a quarterly basis and take into consideration the tenant s payment history  the financial condition of the tenant  business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located 
in the event that the collectibility of deferred rent with respect to any given tenant is in doubt  we would record an increase in our allowance for uncollectible accounts or record a direct write off of the specific rent receivable  which would have an adverse effect on our net income for the year in which the reserve is increased or the direct write off is recorded and would decrease our total assets and stockholders equity 
management considers its loans and other lending investments to be held for investment 
we reflect held for investment investments at amortized cost less allowance for loan losses  acquisition premiums or discounts  deferred loan fees and undisbursed loan funds 
on occasion  we may acquire loans at small premiums or discounts based on the credit characteristics of such loans 
these premiums or discounts are recognized as yield adjustments over the lives of the related loans 
loan origination or exit fees  as well as direct loan origination costs  are also deferred and recognized over the lives of the related loans as yield adjustments 
if loans with premiums  discounts  loan origination or exit fees are prepaid  we immediately recognize the unamortized portion as a decrease or increase in the prepayment gain or loss 
interest income is recognized using the effective interest method applied on a loan by loan basis 
prepayment penalties or yield maintenance payments from borrowers  if any  are recognized as additional income when received 
purchase price allocation we account for acquisitions of real estate in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 business combinations  which requires the purchase price of real estate to be allocated to the acquired tangible assets  consisting of land  building and tenant improvements  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases  the value of in place leases  the value of unamortized lease origination costs and the value of tenant relationships  based in each case on their fair values 
management s estimates of value are made using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers eg  discounted cash flow analysis 
factors considered by management in its analysis include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
we also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre acquisition due diligence  marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
in estimating carrying costs  management also includes real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods  which primarily range from nine to eighteen months  depending on specific local market conditions 
management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions  legal and other related expenses to the extent that such costs are not already incurred in connection with a new lease origination as part of the transaction 
the total amount of other intangible assets acquired are allocated to in place lease values and customer relationship intangible values based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and our overall relationship with that respective tenant 
characteristics to be considered by management in allocating these values include the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant  growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant  the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals including those existing under the terms of the lease agreement  among other factors 
we amortize the value of in place leases to expense over the initial term of the respective leases  which generally range from five to twenty years 
the value of customer relationship intangibles are amortized to expense over the initial term and any renewal periods in the respective leases  but in no event will the amortization period for intangible assets exceed the remaining depreciable life of the building 
should a tenant terminate its lease  the unamortized portion of the in place lease value and customer relationship intangibles would be charged to expense 
we record above market and below market in place lease values for owned properties based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and ii management s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the lease 
we amortize the capitalized above market lease values  included in the accompanying balance sheet as part of deferred rent receivable  as a reduction of rental income over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
we amortize the capitalized below market lease values  included in the accompanying balance sheet as part of the deferred rent liability  as an increase to rental income over the initial term and any fixed rate renewal periods in the respective leases 
we have determined that certain of our properties  which were originally not treated as business combinations under sfas no 
because there was not an existing lease in place at the time of acquisition  should have been treated as business combinations when determining the purchase price of the real estate 
these properties had leases that were put in place on the date of acquisition and thus were implicit in the purchase price and should have been considered as leases in place for purposes of determining if the acquisitions were business combinations 
as a result  we reallocated approximately million of land  building and tenant improvements to intangible assets and recognized additional amortization of  offset by increased rental revenue related to below market rents of approximately  for a net decrease in income of approximately  for the quarter ended march  of the additional  recognized in the quarter ended march   approximately  related to periods prior to  and management has deemed the amount immaterial to those periods 
investments in real estate we record investments in real estate at cost  and we capitalize improvements and replacements when they extend the useful life or improve the efficiency of the asset 
we expense costs of repairs and maintenance as incurred 
we compute depreciation using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of years for buildings and improvements  five to seven years for equipment and fixtures  and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant improvements and leasehold interests 
we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to our investments in real estate 
these assessments have a direct impact on our net income because  if we were to shorten the expected useful lives of our investments in real estate  we would depreciate these investments over fewer years  resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis 
we have adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which establishes a single accounting model for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets including discontinued operations 
sfas no 
requires that the operations related to properties that have been sold or that we intend to sell be presented as discontinued operations in the statement of operations for all periods presented  and properties we intend to sell be designated as held for sale on our balance sheet 
when circumstances such as adverse market conditions indicate a possible impairment of the value of a property  we review the recoverability of the property s carrying value 
the review of recoverability is based on our estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows  excluding interest charges  expected to result from the property s use and eventual disposition 
our forecast of these cash flows considers factors such as expected future operating income  market and other applicable trends and residual value  as well as the effects of leasing demand and competition 
if impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a property  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property 
we are required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the values of our investments in real estate 
provision for loan losses our accounting policies require that we reflect in our financial statements an allowance for estimated credit losses with respect to mortgage loans we have made based upon our evaluation of known and inherent risks associated with our private lending assets 
management reflects provisions for loan losses on a portfolio basis based upon our assessment of general market conditions  our internal risk management policies and credit risk rating system  industry loss experience  our assessment of the likelihood of delinquencies or defaults  and the value of the collateral underlying our investments 
actual losses  if any  could ultimately differ materially from these estimates 
income taxes our financial results generally do not reflect provisions for current or deferred income taxes 
management believes that we have operated  and we intend to continue to operate  in a manner that will allow us to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  and  as a result  we do not expect to pay substantial corporate level income taxes 
many of the requirements for reit qualification  however  are highly technical and complex 
if we were to fail to meet these requirements  we would be subject to federal income tax  which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and amounts available for distributions to our stockholders 
stock based compensation we adopted the fair value method to account for the issuance of stock options under our plan in accordance with sfas no 
r  share base payment  in january of in this regard  a substantial portion of these options were granted to individuals who are our officers and who qualify as leased employees under fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb opinion no 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective approach  where stock based compensation expense was recorded for the unvested portion of previously issued awards that remained outstanding at january  using the same estimate of the grant date fair value and the same attribution method used to determine the pro forma disclosure under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r also requires that all share based payments to employees after january   including employee stock options  be recognized in the financial statements as stock based compensation expense based on the fair value on the date of grant 
on may   our stockholders approved the amended advisory agreement with our adviser and the administrative agreement with our administrator 
in connection with the approval of the amended advisory agreement  we ceased further option grants and terminated the plan on december  on august   all the holders of currently outstanding stock options accepted our offer to amend their stock options and accelerate the expiration date of the outstanding options to december  we were required to record a one time  non cash expense as a result of the amendment of our option plan during the year ended december  of  as of december   there were no options outstanding 
in october of  the financial accounting standards board fasb released fasb staff position no 
fas r fsp fas r  practical accommodation to the application of grant date as defined in fasb statement no 
r 
fsp fas r provides guidance on the application of grant date as defined in sfas no 
r 
the fasb addresses the notion of mutual understanding  specifically that a mutual understanding shall be presumed to exist at the date the award is approved in accordance with the relevant corporate governance requirements if the award is a unilateral grant and therefore the recipient does not have the ability to negotiate the terms and conditions of the award with the employer  and the key terms and conditions of the award are expected to be communicated to an individual recipient within a relatively short time period for the date of approval 
we applied fsp fas r in conjunction with the adoption of sfas no

contractual obligations the following table reflects our significant contractual obligations as of december  contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations interest on long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap total long term debt obligations represent both borrowings under our keybank line of credit and mortgage notes payble that were outstanding as of december  the line of credit matures in december of interest on long term debt obligations does not include interest on our borrowings under our line of credit 
the balance and interest rate on our line of credit is variable and  thus  the amount of interest can not be calculated for purposes of this table 
this does not include the portion of the operating lease on office space that is allocated to us by our adviser in connection with our advisory agreement 
the purchase obligations reflected in the above table represents commitments outstanding at december  to purchase real estate  of which million closed in january of  and million closed in february of funds from operations the national association of real estate investment trusts  or nareit  developed funds from operations  or ffo  as a relative non gaap  generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  supplemental measure of operating performance of an equity reit in order to recognize that income producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined under gaap 
ffo  as defined by nareit  is net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains  or losses  from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with gaap  which  unlike ffo  generally reflects all cash effects of transactions and other events in the determination of net income  and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions 
comparison of ffo  using the nareit definition  to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits 
ffo available to common stockholders is ffo adjusted to subtract preferred share dividends 
we believe that net income available to common stockholders is the most directly comparable gaap measure to ffo available to common stockholders 
basic funds from operations per share  or basic ffo per share  and diluted funds from operations per share  or diluted ffo per share  is ffo available to common stockholders divided by weighted average common shares outstanding and ffo available to common stockholders divided by weighted average common shares outstanding on a diluted basis  respectively  during a period 
we believe that ffo available to common stockholders  basic ffo per share and diluted ffo per share are useful to investors because they provide investors with a further context for evaluating our ffo results in the same manner that investors use net income and earnings per share  or eps  in evaluating net income available to common shareholders 
in addition  since most reits provide ffo  basic ffo and diluted ffo per share information to the investment community  we believe ffo available to common stockholders  basic ffo per share and diluted ffo per share are useful supplemental measures for comparing us to other reits 
we believe that net income is the most directly comparable gaap measure to ffo  basic eps is the most directly comparable gaap measure to basic ffo per share  and that diluted eps is the most directly comparable gaap measure to diluted ffo per share 
the following table provides a reconciliation of our ffo for the years ended december   and  to the most directly comparable gaap measure  net income  and a computation of basic and diluted ffo per weighed average common share and basic and diluted net income per weighted average common share period february  inception for the year ended for the year ended for the year ended through december december  december  december  net income less dividends attributable to preferred stock net income available to common stockholders add real estate depreciation and amortization  including discontinued operations less gain on sale of real estate  net of taxes paid ffo available to common stockholders weighted average shares outstanding basic weighted average shares outstanding diluted basic net income per weighted average common share diluted net income per weighted average common share basic ffo per weighted average common share diluted ffo per weighted average common share item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments 
the primary risk that we believe we will be exposed to is interest rate risk 
we currently own one variable rate loan receivable  certain of our leases contain escalations based on market interest rates  and the interest rate on our existing line of credit is variable 
we seek to mitigate this risk by structuring such provisions to contain a minimum interest rate or escalation rate  as applicable 
we are also exposed to the effects of interest rate changes as a result of the holding of our cash and cash equivalents in short term  interest bearing investments 
to illustrate the potential impact of changes in interest rates on our net income  we have performed the following analysis  which assumes that our balance sheet remains constant and no further actions beyond a minimum interest rate or escalation rate are taken to alter our existing interest rate sensitivity 
under this analysis  a hypothetical increase in the one month libor rate by would increase our interest and rental revenue by  or  over the next twelve months  compared to net income for the latest twelve months ended december  a hypothetical decrease in the one month libor by would decrease our interest and rental revenue by  or  over the next twelve months  compared to net income for the latest twelve months ended december  although management believes that this analysis is indicative of our existing interest rate sensitivity  it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality  size and composition of our loan and lease portfolio on the balance sheet and other business developments that could affect net income 
accordingly  no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the results under this hypothetical analysis 
as of december   our fixed rate debt outstanding was approximately million 
interest rate fluctuations may affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments 
if interest rates on our fixed rate debt instruments  using rates at december   had been one percentage point higher or lower  the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have decreased or increased  respectively  by approximately million 
in the future  we may be exposed to additional effects of interest rate changes primarily as a result of our line of credit or long term debt used to maintain liquidity and fund expansion of our real estate investment portfolio and operations 
our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve this objective  we will borrow primarily at fixed rates or variable rates with the lowest margins available and  in some cases  with the ability to convert variable rates to fixed rates 
we may also enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps in order to mitigate the interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
we will not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
in addition to changes in interest rates  the value of our real estate is subject to fluctuations based on changes in local and regional economic conditions and changes in the creditworthiness of lessees  all of which may affect our ability to refinance debt if necessary
