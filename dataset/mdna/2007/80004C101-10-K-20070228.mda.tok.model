our mission is to be the preferred choice of personal storage solutions for the worldwide digital economy 
we seek to achieve our mission by developing leading technologies and innovative products and delivering our products through both oem and retail channels 
we design  develop  market and manufacture products and solutions in a variety of form factors using our flash memory  controller  and firmware technologies 
our products are used in a wide range of consumer electronics devices such as digital cameras  mobile phones  usb drives  gaming consoles  mp players and other digital devices 
our products are also embedded in a variety of systems for the enterprise  industrial  military and other markets 
flash storage technology allows data to be stored in a low power consumption  durable and compact format that retains the data after the power has been turned off 
as a supplier to this industry  our results are primarily driven by worldwide demand for flash storage devices  which in turn depends on end user demand for electronic products 
we believe the market for flash storage has price elasticity of demand 
we expect that as we reduce the price of our flash devices  consumers will demand an increasing number of megabytes of memory 
in order to profitably capitalize on price elasticity of demand in the market for flash storage products  we must reduce our cost per megabyte at a rate similar to the change in selling price per megabyte to the consumer 
we seek to achieve these cost reductions through technology improvements primarily focused on increasing the amount of memory stored in a given area of silicon 
in january  we acquired matrix  a designer and developer of three dimensional d integrated circuits 
matrix d memory is used for one time programmable storage applications that complement our existing flash storage memory products 

table of contents matrix d memory is used for storage applications that do not require rewriteable memory and where low cost is the paramount consideration  such as video games  music and other content  or for archiving 
the acquisition of matrix resulted in a million write off of in process acquired technology during the first quarter of fiscal in may  we issued and sold billion in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due the notes due 
the notes due were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of per annum 
the notes due may be converted into our common stock  under certain circumstances  based on an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes which represents an initial conversion price of approximately per share 
the conversion price will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for accrued interest 
the net proceeds to us from the offering of the notes due were billion 
concurrently with the issuance of the notes due  we purchased a convertible bond hedge and sold warrants 
the separate convertible bond hedge and warrant transactions are structured to reduce the potential future economic dilution associated with the conversion of the notes due and to increase the initial conversion price to per share 
net proceeds from this offering will be used for general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures for new and existing manufacturing facilities  development of new technologies  general working capital and other non manufacturing capital expenditures 
the net proceeds may also be used to fund strategic investments or acquisitions of products  technologies or complementary businesses or obtain the right or license to use additional technologies 
on july   we and toshiba corporation  or toshiba  entered into a business venture  flash alliance  to build fab  a new advanced millimeter wafer fabrication facility at toshiba s yokkaichi  japan operations  to meet the anticipated growing demand for nand flash memory in and beyond 
we own and toshiba owns of flash alliance 
both we and toshiba will collaborate in the development and manufacture of nand flash memory products 
these nand flash memory products will be manufactured by toshiba at fab using semiconductor manufacturing equipment owned or leased by flash alliance 
flash alliance will purchase wafers from toshiba at cost and then resell those wafers to us and toshiba at cost plus a markup 
we account for our ownership position in flash alliance under the equity method of accounting 
we are committed to purchase half of flash alliance s nand wafer supply

beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  or sfas r  share based payments  using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation cost recognized on a straight line basis  in the year ended december  included the following a compensation cost based on the grant date fair value related to any share based awards granted through  but not yet vested as of january   and b compensation cost for any share based awards granted on or subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
as a result of adopting sfas r  we recognized share based compensation expense of million during the year ended december   which affected our reported cost of sales  research and development  selling and marketing and general and administrative expenses 
in addition  at december   we capitalized to inventory million of compensation cost for share based awards that were issued to manufacturing personnel 
we calculate this share based compensation expense based on the fair values of the share based compensation awards as estimated using the black scholes merton closed form option valuation model 
as of december   total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested share based compensation arrangements already granted under our various plans was million  which we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of years 
on november   we acquired msystems ltd  or msystems 
msystems designs  develops and markets innovative flash data storage solutions for digital consumer electronics markets 
msystems primarily targets two digital consumer electronics markets the mobile phone market and the usb flash drive market 
msystems also sells flash data storage products targeted at the embedded systems market 
the acquisition of msystems resulted in a million write off of in process acquired technology during the fourth quarter of fiscal on november   we assumed through our acquisition of msystems  million in aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due  or the notes due the notes due pay interest at a rate of per annum 
the notes due may be converted into our common stock  under certain circumstances  based on an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes which represents an initial conversion price of approximately per share 
the conversion price will be subject to adjustment in certain events but will not be adjusted for accrued interest 

table of contents critical accounting policies estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  among others  those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories and related reserves  investments  income taxes  warranty obligations  stock compensation  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities when those values are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates have historically approximated actual results 
however  future results will differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
revenue recognition  sales returns and allowances and sales incentive programs 
we recognize net revenues when the earnings process is complete  as evidenced by an agreement with the customer  transfer of title and acceptance  if applicable  fixed pricing and reasonable assurance of realization 
sales made to distributors and retailers are generally under agreements allowing price protection and or right of return and  therefore  the sales and related costs of these transactions are deferred until the retailers or distributors sell the merchandise to their end customer  or the rights of return expire 
at december  and january   deferred income  from sales to distributors and retailers was million and million  respectively 
estimated sales returns are provided for as a reduction to product revenue and deferred revenue and were not material for any period presented in our consolidated financial statements 
we record estimated reductions to revenue or to deferred revenue for customer and distributor incentive programs and offerings  including price protection  promotions  co op advertising  and other volume based incentives and expected returns 
additionally  we have incentive programs that require us to estimate  based on historical experience  the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive 
all sales incentive programs are recorded as an offset to product revenues or deferred revenues 
in the past  actual returns and rebates have not been significantly different from our estimates 
however  actual returns and rebates in any future period could differ from our estimates  which could impact the net revenue we report 
inventories and inventory valuation 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
market value is based upon an estimated average selling price reduced by estimated costs of disposal 
the determination of market value involves numerous judgments including estimating average selling prices based upon recent sales volumes  industry trends  existing customer orders  current contract prices  industry analysis of supply and demand and seasonal factors 
should actual market conditions differ from our estimates  our future results of operations could be materially affected 
the valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory 
the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products within specific time horizons  generally six to twelve months 
to the extent our demand forecast for specific products is less than our product on hand and our noncancelable orders  we could be required to record additional inventory reserves  which would have a negative impact on our gross margin 
accounting for investments 
we evaluate whether entities in which we have invested are variable interest entities within the definition of the financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
r  or fin r  accounting for variable interest entities 
if those entities are variable interest entities  then we determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of that entity by reference to our contractual and business arrangements with respect to residual gains and residual losses on liquidation of that entity 
with respect to all equity investments  we review the degree of control that our investment and other arrangements give us over the entity we have invested in 
generally  after considering all factors  if we hold equity interests representing less than of the outstanding voting interests of an entity we invested in  we use the cost method of accounting 
if we hold at least but less than a majority of the outstanding voting interests of an entity we invested in  we use the equity method of accounting 
we have the financial capability and the intent to hold our loans to the ventures with toshiba until maturity and accordingly those loans are carried at cost and their value in our financial statements is not adjusted to market value 
changes in our intent could materially impact our financial statements 

table of contents deferred tax assets 
we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
we consider historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
if recovery is not likely  we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
we carried a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets of million and million at december  and january   respectively  based on our view that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to take tax a benefit for certain net operating loss carryforwards  certain capitalized expenses and certain unrealized capital losses on our investments in foundries 
share based compensation employee incentive plans and employee stock purchase plans 
beginning on january   we began accounting for stock awards and espp shares under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  or sfas r  share based payments  which requires the recognition of the fair value of share based compensation 
the fair value of stock awards and espp shares was estimated using a black scholes merton closed form option valuation model 
this model requires the input of assumptions in implementing sfas r  including expected stock price volatility  expected term and estimated forfeitures of each award 
the parameters used in the model are reviewed and adjusted on a quarterly basis 
we elected the modified prospective method for adoption of sfas r 
we recognized compensation expense for the fair values of these awards  which have graded vesting  on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of each of these awards  net of estimated forfeitures at a rate of 
we make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of the apic credit pool generated by previous share based excess tax benefits to determine if there are any tax deficiencies which require recognition in the condensed consolidated statements of income 
prior to the implementation of sfas r  we accounted for stock awards and espp shares under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and made pro forma footnote disclosures as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amended statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share disclosed in the footnotes to the consolidated condensed financial statements were estimated using a black scholes merton closed form option valuation model to determine the estimated fair value and by attributing such fair value over the requisite service period on a straight line basis for those awards that actually vested 
the fair value of restricted stock units was calculated based upon the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
business combinations 
in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard no 
 or sfas  business combinations  we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and in process research and development based on their estimated fair values 
we engage third party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
such a valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from product sales  customer relationships and acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  as well as assumptions about the expected life of the core technology and discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results

each of these components are discussed separately below convertible bond hedge 
counterparties agreed to sell to us up to approximately million shares of our common stock  which is the number of shares initially issuable upon conversion of the notes in full  at a price of per share 
the convertible bond hedge transaction will be settled in net shares and will terminate upon the earlier of the maturity date of the notes or the first day none of the notes remain outstanding due to conversion or otherwise 
settlement of the convertible bond hedge in net shares on the expiration date would result in us receiving net shares equivalent to the number of shares issuable by us upon conversion of the notes 
should there be an early unwind of the convertible bond hedge transaction  the number of net shares potentially received by us will depend upon the then existing overall market conditions  our stock price  the volatility of our stock  and the amount of time remaining before expiration of the convertible bond hedge

we are contractually obligated to purchase half of flashvision s  flash partners and  when operational  flash alliance s nand wafer supply 
we cannot estimate the total amount of our wafer purchase commitment as of december  because our price is determined by reference to the future cost to produce the semiconductor wafers 
in addition to the semiconductor assets owned or leased by flashvision and flash partners  we directly own certain semiconductor manufacturing equipment in toshiba s yokkaichi  japan operations from which we receive of the output 
from time to time  we and toshiba mutually approve increases in the wafer supply capacity of flash partners that may contractually obligate us to increase capital funding 
our direct research and development contribution is based on a variable computation 
we and toshiba each pay the cost of our own design teams and of the wafer processing and similar costs associated with this direct design and development of flash memory 
we account for our ownership position in the flash ventures under the equity method of accounting

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in widely diversified short term investments  consisting primarily of investment grade securities  substantially all of which either mature within the next twelve months or have characteristics of short term investments 
as of december   a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million decline less than in the fair value of our available for sale debt securities 
foreign currency risk 
a substantial majority of our revenue  expense and capital purchasing activity is transacted in us dollars 
however  we do enter into transactions in other currencies  primarily the japanese yen 
movements in currency exchange rates  especially the japanese yen  could cause variability in our revenues  expenses or other income expense  net 
we had forward exchange contracts in place with a notional amount of billion japanese yen  or approximately million based upon the exchange rate at december  and approximately million as of january  the effect of an immediate adverse change in exchange rates on forward exchange contracts would result in an approximate million loss 
however  as we utilize foreign currency instruments  for mitigating anticipated balance sheet exposures  a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the value of the underlying exposure 
see item a  risk factors and note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
market risk 
we also hold available for sale equity securities in semiconductor wafer manufacturing companies 
as of december   a reduction in prices of of these marketable equity securities would result in a decrease in the fair value of our investments in marketable equity securities of approximately million 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analysis performed on our financial position at december  actual results may differ materially
