merchant banking fund management  which currently consists primarily of management of greenhill s private equity funds  greenhill capital partners or gcp  greenhill s venture capital fund  greenhill sav partners or gsavp  and principal investments by greenhill in those funds 
historically  our financial advisory business has accounted for the majority of our revenues  and we expect that to remain so for the near to medium term  although there may be periods  such as the first quarter of  in which merchant banking results outweigh our financial advisory earnings 
the main driver of the financial advisory business is overall mergers and acquisitions  or m a  and restructuring volume  particularly in the industry sectors and geographic markets in which we focus 
in addition  new managing director hires add incrementally to our revenue and income growth potential 
the principal drivers of our merchant banking fund management revenues are realized and unrealized gains on investments and profit overrides  the size and timing of which are tied to a number of different factors including the performance of the particular companies in which we invest  general 
table of contents economic conditions in the debt and equity markets and other factors which affect the industries in which we invest  such as commodity prices 
our revenues can fluctuate materially depending on the number and size of completed transactions on which we advised and the levels of gain realized on our merchant banking investments  as well as other factors 
accordingly  the revenues in any particular year may not be indicative of future results 
business environment economic and global financial market conditions can materially affect our financial performance 
see risk factors 
net income and revenues in any period may not be indicative of full year results or the results of any other period and may vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter 
financial advisory revenues were a record million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december   which represents an increase of 
at the same time  worldwide completed m a volume increased by  from  billion in to  billion in  and aggregate advisory revenue reported by four leading investment banks that publicly disclose their advisory fee revenue increased by from billion in to billion in 
from a longer term perspective  our financial advisory revenues were higher than in  while the aggregate advisory revenue reported by the four larger firms was higher than in although we may benefit from any sustained increase in m a volume  we have been and will continue to be constrained by the relatively small size of our firm and we may not grow as rapidly as our principal competitors 
in addition  some of the benefits we expect to experience in connection with the recent increase in m a volume will be partially offset by the continued decline in restructuring activity 
merchant banking and other revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december   which represents an increase of 
merchant banking revenues principally consisted of realized and unrealized gains on investments in gcp  merchant banking profit overrides and management fees 
while the amount of management fees earned from our existing merchant banking funds are principally a function of the amount of capital invested in the case of gcp i or committed in the case of gcp ii and gsavp  those portions of merchant banking revenues consisting of gains and profit overrides may vary considerably depending on economic conditions and the performance of the individual companies in which we invest 
during and  several gcp portfolio companies benefited from favorable conditions in the financing markets 
adverse changes in general economic conditions  commodity prices  credit and public equity markets could impact negatively the amount of merchant banking revenue realized by the firm

we operate in a highly competitive environment where there are no long term contracted sources of revenue  and each revenue generating engagement  which typically relates to only one potential transaction  is separately awarded and negotiated 
our list of clients  and our list of clients with whom there is a currently active revenue generating engagement  changes continually 
we gain new clients each year through our business development initiatives  by recruiting additional senior investment banking professionals who bring with them client relationships and through referrals from directors  attorneys and other parties with whom we have relationships 
at the same time  we lose clients each year as a result of the sale or merger of a client  a change in a client s senior management  competition from other investment banks and other causes 
we earn a majority of our financial advisory revenue from completion fees that are dependent on the successful completion of a merger  acquisition  restructuring or similar transaction 
a transaction can fail to be completed for many reasons  including failure to agree upon final terms with the counterparty  failure to secure necessary board or shareholder approvals  failure to secure necessary financing and failure to achieve necessary regulatory approvals 
in certain client engagements  often those involving financially distressed companies  we earn a significant portion of our revenue in the form of retainers and similar fees that are contractually agreed upon with each client for each assignment but are not necessarily linked to the end result 
we do not allocate our financial advisory revenue by type of advice rendered m a  restructuring or other because of the complexity of the assignments for which we earn revenue 
for example  a restructuring assignment can involve  and in some cases end successfully in  a sale of all or part of the financially distressed client 
likewise  an acquisition assignment can relate to a financially distressed target involved in or considering a restructuring 
finally  an m a assignment can be received from a relationship that derives from a prior restructuring assignment  and vice versa 
versus financial advisory revenues were million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december   which represents an increase of 
the increase reflected the benefit of an increase in m a market volume and our continued business development efforts  offset in part  by the impact of a decline in the volume of financial distress related business

we began our merchant banking activities with the formation of our first fund  gcp i  in  which had committed capital of million 
at the outset of that fund our managing directors committed capital to the fund and were awarded substantially all of the rights to receive overrides on profits that might be earned by the general partner of the fund 
for the period through our activities consisted principally of our management of gcp i 
in we began to invest directly in gcp i by purchasing limited partnership interests 
in early our investment increased as a result of the assignment to us of a portion of the future commitments of our managing directors 
in we also increased our economic share of the profit override of the fund to for all investments made on or after january  of the profit override is reflected in our revenues in accordance with our consolidation policy 
the remaining share of the profit overrides was retained by our employees and is reflected in compensation expense 
in aggregate we committed million to gcp i  with a majority of our capital deployed for investments made subsequent to january  in march we expanded our merchant banking activities with the closing of our second fund  gcp ii 
we committed approximately million to gcp ii  or approximately of the committed capital of million  and our employees committed an additional million to gcp ii 
we are entitled to receive of the profit overrides for all investments made by gcp ii of the profit override  if any  is reflected in our revenues in accordance with our consolidation policy 
our employees are entitled to receive the remaining of the profit overrides 
see below for more information regarding our consolidation of the profit overrides 
in march we expanded our merchant banking activities with the closing of our first venture capital fund  gsavp 
we committed approximately million to gsavp  or approximately of the committed capital of million  and our employees committed an additional million to gsavp 
we are entitled to receive of the profit overrides for all investments made by gsavp of the profit override  if any  is reflected in our revenues in accordance with our consolidation policy 
our employees are entitled to receive the remaining of the profit overrides 
see below for more information regarding our consolidation of the profit overrides 
we generate merchant banking revenue from i management fees paid by the funds  ii gains or losses on our investments in the merchant banking funds  and iii profit overrides 
we charge management fees in gcp i to all outside investors who are not employed or affiliated with us 
in gcp ii and gsavp we charge management fees to all investors except the firm 
management fees are generally charged based upon a percentage of committed capital ranging from to during the year commitment period and as a percentage of invested capital ranging from to after the termination of the commitment period 
our management fees also include portions of other transactions fees which may be paid directly to us by portfolio companies of the merchant banking funds 
we earned annual fees from gcp i of approximately million during the commitment period which ended march  and for expect to earn approximately million in management fees from gcp i 
the amount of management fees earned from gcp i is dependent on the amount of invested capital and will decline over the remaining life of the fund as investments are liquidated a process which we expect will end by 
we currently earn annual fees from gcp ii of approximately million  and we expect to earn such amount through or such earlier time as the commitment period terminates and a lesser amount thereafter 
we 
table of contents currently earn annual fees from gsavp of approximately million  and we expect to earn such amount through or such earlier time as the commitment period terminates and a lesser amount thereafter 
depending upon the performance of our funds  we will record investment income or losses based upon our allocable share of invested capital in our funds 
since we began investing in our funds in we have recognized realized and unrealized investment earnings from such funds 
prior to we realized investment earnings from our interest in barrow street capital  llc  a limited liability company that manages real estate merchant banking funds 
one of the managing principals of barrow street capital  llc is robert f 
greenhill  jr  son of robert f 
greenhill  chairman and chief executive of greenhill 
the investment in barrow street capital  llc was sold to the managing principals of barrow street capital  llc in march for book value 
net realized and unrealized gains on investments in merchant banking are comprised of investment income  realized and unrealized gains from the firm s investments in merchant banking funds  and the consolidated earnings of the general partners of these funds in which we have a majority economic interest  offset by allocated expenses of the funds 
that portion of the earnings of the general partner exclusive of profit overrides which is held by employees of the firm is recorded as minority interest 
we recognize revenue on investments in merchant banking funds based on our allocable share of realized and unrealized gains or losses reported by such funds on a quarterly basis 
we record our investments at estimated fair value 
investments in privately held companies are initially carried at cost as an approximation of fair value and generally adjusted after being held by the fund for one year to the estimated fair value as determined by the general partner of the fund after giving consideration to the cost of the security  the pricing of other sales of securities by the portfolio company  the price of securities of other companies comparable to the portfolio company  purchase multiples paid in other comparable third party transactions  the original purchase price multiple  market conditions  liquidity  operating results and other financial data 
discounts are generally applied to the funds privately held investments to reflect the lack of liquidity and other transfer restrictions 
investments in publicly traded securities are valued using quoted market prices discounted for any legal or contractual restrictions on sale 
because of the inherent uncertainty of valuations as well as the discounts applied  the estimated fair values of investment in privately held companies may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed 
the values at which our investments are carried on our books are adjusted to fair value at the end of each quarter and the volatility in general economic conditions  stock markets and commodity prices may result in significant changes in the fair value of the investments 
significant changes in the fair value of our investments may have a material effect  positive or negative  on our revenues and thus the results of operations 
as the general partner of our merchant banking funds  we make investment decisions for the funds and are entitled to receive from the funds an override of the profits of the funds 
in aggregate  we and our employees are entitled to a profit override percentage of of the profits earned by unaffiliated investors in gcp i and generally for all investors except the firm in gcp ii and gsavp 
we are deemed to have the majority of the economic interest in the managing general partner of gcp i and the general partners of gcp ii and gsavp in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  effective for investments made beginning early 
under fin r we include as consolidated revenue all realized and unrealized profit overrides earned by the managing general partners of gcp i  gcp ii and gsavp 
from an economic perspective  profit overrides in respect of such investments are allocated to the firm and to employees of the firm 
the economic share of the profit overrides allocated to the employees of the firm is recorded as compensation expense 
for investments made prior to  we did not have a majority of the economic interest and only that portion of the profit override allocable directly to us  which ranges from  is included in our consolidated revenue 
because we include in our revenues all of the profit overrides earned from investments made on or after january   we expect that as the investments mature and  depending upon market 
table of contents conditions  that the amount of our profit overrides could increase 
the amount of profit overrides we recognize as revenue will depend upon the underlying fair value of the portfolio company and is subject to the volatility referred to above 
versus in the year ended december   the firm earned million in merchant banking fund management other revenue compared to million in the year ended december   an increase of 
the increase was primarily due to higher management fees resulting from a full year of management of gcp ii and the establishment of gsavp 
realized and unrealized investment gains and profit overrides were comparable in and in total  gcp and the firm earned revenues relating to portfolio companies and incurred losses relating to one portfolio company in gcp and the firm earned revenue from portfolio companies in the firm had no investments in that contributed more than to total revenues and one investment in that contributed more than to total revenues 
gcp gains and losses relating to investments made in or later have a larger impact on firm revenue because of the firm s increased investment in  and increased participation in profit overrides relating to  gcp starting in early included in merchant banking fund management other revenue for the years ended december  and is million and million related to the portion of the interests in the general partners of gcp which are held directly by employees of the firm  which is deducted as minority interest 
versus in the year ended december   the firm earned million in merchant banking fund management other revenue compared to million in the year ended december   an increase of 
these increases are primarily due to higher management fees resulting from greater assets under management  higher dividend income and distributions of earnings from portfolio companies  higher realized and unrealized principal investment gains in the gcp portfolio  an increase in the recognized amounts of profit overrides associated with gains in the gcp portfolio and an increase in interest income 
gcp gains and losses relating to investments made in or later have a larger impact on firm revenue because of the firm s increased investment in  and increased participation in profit overrides relating to  gcp starting in early the firm had one investment that contributed more than to total revenues in and none in included in merchant banking fund management other revenue for the year ended december  is million related to the portion of the interests in the general partners of gcp which are held directly by employees of the firm  which is deducted as minority interest 
the investment gains or losses in our investment portfolio may fluctuate significantly over time due to factors beyond our control  such as individual portfolio company performance  equity market valuations and merger and acquisition opportunities 
revenue recognized from gains recorded in the  and are not necessarily indicative of revenue that may be realized in future periods 
operating expenses our total operating expenses for the year ended december  were million  which compares to total operating expenses of million for the increase of million  or  relates primarily to compensation expense which is paid as a percentage of revenue and is described in more detail below 
the pre tax income margin for the year ended december  was in both and we classify operating expenses as compensation and benefits expense and non compensation expenses 
management does not separately evaluate operating expenses by financial advisory and merchant banking activities 
the principal component of our operating expenses is compensation and benefits expense 
because we were a limited liability company prior to our initial public offering in may  payments for services rendered by our managing directors prior to our initial public offering were generally accounted for as distributions of members capital or minority interest expense rather than as compensation expense 
as a result  our pre initial public offering compensation and benefits expense did not reflect a large portion of payments for services rendered by our managing directors and therefore understates our operating costs as a public company 
as a corporation  we now include all payments for services rendered by our managing directors in compensation and benefits expense 

table of contents operating expenses apart from compensation have been modest in proportion to revenues  as a result of the relatively small number of staff and related costs including travel  office space  communications  information services  depreciation and professional services that greenhill bears 
a portion of certain costs are reimbursed by clients under the terms of client engagements 
in addition  until august  barrow street capital subleased office space from us and reimbursed us for the use of other facilities and participation in our health care plans 
the following table sets forth information relating to our actual and pro forma operating expenses  which are reported net of reimbursements of certain expenses by our clients and merchant banking portfolio companies

a amounts for the years ended december  and reflect actual expenses for the entire period 
amounts for the year ended december  reflect actual expenses for the period subsequent to our initial public offering in may and pro forma expenses for the period prior to our initial public offering 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for information on the pro forma adjustments 
compensation and benefits the principal component of our operating expenses is compensation and benefits expense 
it is our policy that our total compensation and benefits  including that payable to our managing directors and senior advisors  will not exceed of total revenues each year although we retain the ability to change this policy in the future 
because we were a limited liability company prior to our initial public offering  payments for services rendered by our managing directors generally were accounted for as distributions of members capital or minority interest expense rather than as compensation expense 
as a result  our pre initial public offering compensation and benefits expense did not reflect a large portion of payments for services rendered by our managing directors and understates the expected operating costs to be incurred as a public company 
as a corporation  we include all payments for services rendered by our managing directors in compensation and benefits expense 
one factor in determining the compensation expense ratio in and was the accounting impact of the introduction into our compensation packages of equity related compensation in the form of restricted stock units 
as a public company  the compensation we pay to our employees consists of base salary and benefits  cash bonus awards and the award of restricted stock units 
base salary and benefits are paid ratably throughout the year 
cash bonuses  which are accrued each period  are discretionary and dependent upon on number of factors  including the performance of the firm 
discretionary cash bonus payments are paid annually in february following year end 
awards of restricted stock units are also discretionary and amortized to compensation expense based upon the value of the award at the time of grant during the service period over which the award vests  which is generally five years 
as 
table of contents we expense these awards  the restricted stock units recognized are recorded within stockholders equity 
in january  our employees were granted  restricted stock units in conjunction with the compensation 
versus for the year ended december   our employee compensation and benefits expenses were million  which compares to million of compensation and benefits expense for the year ended december  for the year ended december   the ratio of compensation to revenues was  which was approximately the same as for the comparable period in this represents an increase of in total compensation and benefits expense  and is principally related to the increase in revenues for the year 
as restricted stock unit awards vest over future years  it is expected that the compensation ratio will gradually increase 
versus our total compensation and benefits expense for the year ended december  was million  which reflects a compensation ratio for the year 
this compares against million of pro forma compensation and benefits expense  which reflects a compensation ratio for the year ended december  this represents an increase of in total compensation and benefits expense  and is principally related to the increase in revenues for the year and the increase in the compensation ratio resulting from the amortization charge for awards of restricted stock units 
as restricted stock unit awards vest over future years  it is expected that the compensation ratio will gradually increase 
our actual compensation and benefits expense for the year ended december  was million 
our compensation expense is generally based upon revenue and can fluctuate materially in any particular year depending upon the amount of revenue recognized as well as other factors 
accordingly  the amount of compensation expense recognized in any particular year may not be indicative of compensation expense in a future period 
non compensation expense our non compensation expense includes the costs for occupancy and rental  communications  information services  professional fees  recruiting  travel and entertainment  insurance  depreciation and other operating expenses 
reimbursable client expenses are netted against non compensation expenses 
as a public company  our costs for such items as insurance and professional fees  principally accounting and legal advice have increased 
we also expect that our non compensation costs  particularly occupancy  travel and information services costs  will increase as we grow our business and make strategic investments 
versus for the year ended december   our non compensation expenses were million  which compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of 
the increase in as compared to is related principally to expenses and provisions for legal contingencies million  increases in occupancy and other costs associated with new office space in london and new york million  losses from foreign currency movements million  and greater information services million and travel million costs primarily as a result of the growth in personnel and business development activities  offset in part by the absence of the third party fee related to fundraising for gcp ii million and the charge for uncollectible accounts million 
non compensation expenses as a percentage of revenues were for the years ended december  and  respectively 
versus for the year ended december   our non compensation expenses were million  which compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of 
the increase is related principally to a third party fee related to the fundraising for greenhill capital partners ii million  greater travel million and information services million as a result of additional personnel and business development activity  increase in 
table of contents occupancy costs million  the net write off of uncollectible accounts million and increases in professional fees primarily associated with operating as a public company million  offset in part by lower depreciation expense million primarily due to full depreciation of the airplane in and the absence of a one time transaction specific consultancy expense reflected in expenses million 
non compensation expense as a percentage of revenue in the year ended december  was 
this compares to for the year ended december  the decrease in these expenses as a percentage of revenue in as compared to reflects a small increase in actual non compensation costs spread over greater revenue 
the firm s non compensation expense as a percentage of revenue can vary as a result of a variety of factors  including fluctuation in annual revenue amounts  the amount of recruiting and business development activity  the amount of reimbursement of engagement related expenses by clients  currency movements and other factors 
accordingly  the non compensation expense as a percentage of revenue in any particular year may not be indicative of the non compensation expense as a percentage of revenue in future periods 
provision for income taxes as a result of the completion of our initial public offering in may  we are subject to federal  foreign and state corporate income taxes 
prior to our initial public offering  greenhill was a limited liability company and was generally not subject to us federal or state income taxes and its uk controlled affiliate greenhill co 
international llp  as a limited liability partnership  was generally not subject to uk income taxes 
however  greenhill was subject to local taxes on its us earnings 
in addition  certain of greenhill s non us subsidiaries have been subject to income taxes in their local jurisdictions 
versus for the year ended december   the provision for taxes was million  which reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 
this compares to a provision for taxes for the year ended december  of million based on an effective tax rate of approximately 
the increase in the provision for taxes is primarily due to the higher pre tax income 
the lower effective tax rate in as compared to results from the fact that a greater proportion of our income was earned in lower tax rate jurisdictions  as well as  lower state and local income taxes 
versus for the year ended december   our provision for taxes was million  at an effective tax rate of 
for the year ended december   the pro forma provision for taxes of million reflected an assumed tax rate of 
the pro forma provision for taxes for the year ended december  includes assumed federal  foreign  state and local income taxes as if we were a c corporation for the period january  to the date of the public offering at an assumed effective rate of combined with the actual tax provision for the period after the public offering 
the decrease in the effective tax rate in as compared to reflects the benefit of a higher proportion of investment income and uk based advisory income  which generally are taxed at lower rates than us based advisory income 
our actual effective tax rate for was reflecting our status as a c corporation for the period between our public offering and december  
actual tax expense for the year ended december  was million 
the effective tax rate can fluctuate as a result of variations in the relative amounts of advisory and merchant banking income earned in the tax jurisdictions in which the firm operates and invests 
accordingly  the effective tax rate in any particular period may not be indicative of the effective tax rate in future periods 
geographic data for a summary of the total revenues  income before minority interest and tax  net income and total assets of greenhill by geographic region  see note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our liquidity position is monitored by our management committee  which generally meets monthly 
the management committee monitors cash  other significant working capital assets and liabilities  debt  principal investment commitments and other matters relating to liquidity requirements 
as cash accumulates it is invested in short term liquid investments 
we generate cash from both our operating activities in the form of advisory and asset management fees and our merchant banking investments in the form of distributions of investment proceeds and profit overrides 
we use our cash primarily for operating purposes  compensation of our employees  payment of income taxes  investments in merchant banking funds  payment of dividends  repurchase of shares of our stock and leasehold improvements 
our cash balances generally accumulate from our operating activities during the year 
in general  we collect our accounts receivable within days except for certain restructuring transactions where collections may take longer due to court ordered holdbacks 
our liabilities typically consist of accounts payable  which are generally paid monthly  accrued compensation  which includes accrued bonuses that are paid in the first quarter of the following year to the large majority of our employees  and taxes payable 
in the first quarter of  cash bonuses of million relating to compensation were paid to our employees 
in addition  we expect to pay approximately million in early related to income taxes owed for the year ended december  a large portion of our liabilities are associated with unrealized earnings ie  recorded on our books but for which cash proceeds have not yet been received from our merchant banking investments 
at december  approximately million of our bonus accrual related to profit overrides for unrealized gains of gcp and million related to deferred tax liabilities that are deferred until the gains from the gcp investments are realized 
these amounts may increase or decrease depending on the change in the fair value of the gcp funds and are payable  subject to clawback  at the time the funds realize cash proceeds 
since our initial public offering we have used a portion of our cash reserves to repurchase shares of our common stock  pay dividends and make investments in our merchant banking funds 
our commitments to our merchant banking funds may require us to fund capital calls on short notice 
on the other hand  distributions from our merchant banking funds are generally made shortly after proceeds are received by the funds 
we are unable to predict the timing or magnitude of share repurchase opportunities  capital call requirements or distribution of investment proceeds 
our merchant banking funds typically invest in privately held companies 
the ability of our merchant banking funds to sell or dispose of the securities they own depends on a number of factors beyond the control of the funds  including general economic and sector conditions  stock market conditions  the availability of financing to potential buyers of such securities  among others 
as a result we consider our investments illiquid for the short term 
because it is not tax efficient  our foreign earnings are generally not available to fund our us working capital needs  including share purchases  dividend payments or merchant banking investments 
to increase our financial flexibility  during  we obtained from a us commercial bank an unsecured million revolving loan facility to provide for working capital needs  facilitate the funding of merchant banking investments and other general corporate purposes 
we intend to increase the facility to million during the first quarter of interest on borrowings is based on libor plus 
the revolving bank loan facility matures on august  at december   million of borrowings were outstanding on the loan facility 
as of december   we had total commitments not reflected on our balance sheet relating to future principal investments in gcp  gsavp and other merchant banking activities of million 
these commitments are expected to be drawn on from time to time and be substantially invested over a period of up to five years from the relevant commitment dates 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contractual obligations 

table of contents on december   one of our subsidiaries acquired ordinary shares of ironshore inc  a newly formed insurance company  for million 
we expect these securities to be acquired by a new merchant banking fund to be formed by us in the first half of if we are unsuccessful in raising the new fund  the firm will retain its investment in ironshore inc during  we repurchased  shares of our common stock in open market purchases at an average price of per share 
also during  we completed the purchase at a discount to market of  shares of which  shares were contracted for purchase at december  at an average price of per share from a former employee 
additionally  we are deemed to have repurchased  shares of our common stock at an average of per share in conjunction with the payment of tax liabilities in respect of stock delivered to our employees in settlement of restricted stock units 
the firm has remaining authorization to repurchase up to million of common stock in open market transactions 
we believe that the cash generated from operations and funds available from the revolving bank loan facility will be sufficient to meet our expected operating needs  commitments to our merchant banking activities  build out costs of new office space  tax obligations  share repurchases and common dividends 
in the event that our needs for liquidity should increase as we expand our business  we may consider a range of financing alternatives to meet any such needs 
cash flows cash and cash equivalents decreased by million in we generated million from operating activities  including million from net income after giving effect to the non cash items and by a net increase in working capital of million principally from the accrual of compensation expense and taxes payable and an increase in accounts receivable  offset in part by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
we used million in investing activities  including million in new investments in merchant banking funds and shares of ironshore  inc  million from the net purchase of auction rate securities  million from the build out of new office space and million in the purchase of beaufort partners limited  offset in part by million in distributions from our merchant banking investments

a portion of our financing activities were funded through net borrowings of million 
cash and cash equivalents increased by million in we generated million from operating activities  including million from net income after giving effect to the non cash items and by a net increase in working capital of million principally from the accrual of compensation expense  accounts payable and accrued expenses and taxes payable 
we generated million from investing activities  including million from the net sale of securities and million from distributions from our merchant banking investments  partially offset by million in new investments in merchant banking funds 
we used million for financing activities  including million for the payment of dividends and million for the repurchase of our common stock 
cash increased million in cash of million was provided by operating activities  including million from net income after giving effect to non cash items and a net change in working capital of million principally from an increase in accrued compensation payable offset by the payout of the prior year s minority interest in the net assets of our uk affiliate of million 
we used cash generated from operations principally to fund distributions to members of earnings prior to the initial public offering of million  dividend payments of million  and million in purchases of property and equipment  primarily for the build out of additional office space in new york

market risk we limit our investments to short term cash investments  which we believe do not face any material interest rate risk  equity price risk or other market risk and principal investments made in or on behalf of gcp  gsavp and other merchant banking funds 
we have invested our cash in short duration  highly rates fixed income investments including highly rated short term debt securities and money market funds 
changes in interest rates and other economic and market conditions could affect these investments adversely  however  we do not believe that any such changes will have a material effect on our results of operations 
our short term cash investments are primarily denominated in us dollars  uk sterling and euros  and we face modest foreign currency risk in our cash balances held in accounts outside the united states due to potential currency movements and the associated accounting requirements 
to the extent that the cash balances in local currency exceed our short term obligations  we may hedge our foreign currency exposure 
with regard to our principal investments including our portion of any profit overrides earned on such investments  we face exposure to changes in the estimated fair value of the companies in which we and our merchant banking funds invest  which historically has been volatile 
significant changes in the public equity markets may have a material effect on our results of operations 
volatility in the general equity markets would impact our operations primarily because of changes in the fair value of 
table of contents our merchant banking or principal investments that are publicly traded securities 
we have analyzed our potential exposure to general equity market risk by performing sensitivity analyses on those investments held by us and in our merchant banking funds which consist of publicly traded securities

we meet on a quarterly basis to determine the fair value of the investments held in our merchant banking portfolio and to discuss the risks associated with those investments 
the investment committee manages the risks associated with the merchant banking portfolio by closely monitoring and managing the types of investments made as well as the monetization and realization of existing investments 
in addition  the reported amounts of our revenues may be affected by movements in the rate of exchange between the euro  pound sterling and canadian dollar in which of our revenues for the year ended december  were denominated and the dollar  in which our financial statements are denominated 
we do not currently hedge against movements in these exchange rates

we do not believe we face any material risk in this respect 
critical accounting policies and estimates we believe that the following discussion addresses greenhill s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
basis of financial information the firm s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require management to make estimates and assumptions regarding future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and related footnotes  including investment valuations  compensation accruals and other matters 
we believe that the estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements are reasonable and prudent 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates
