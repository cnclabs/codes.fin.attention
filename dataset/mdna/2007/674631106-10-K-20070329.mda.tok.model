these matters are more fully discussed in note restatements  to the consolidated financial statements

we were founded in and have conducted operations within the aforementioned categories since then

prepaid expenses in any given year we introduce certain new products to our customers 
in connection therewith  we produce new collatral materials to be distributed over a period of time 
we follow the policy of amortizing these costs over a one year basis 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment are stated at cost

stock based compensation at december   the company had options outstanding under three stock based compensation plans  which are described below 
on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation cost for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  the company accounted for its stock based employee compensation related to stock options under the intrinsic value recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and the disclosure alternative prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
accordingly  the company presents pro forma information for the periods prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r and no employee compensation cost was recognized for the stock based compensation plans other than the grant date intrinsic value  if any  for the options granted prior to january  concentration of credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of accounts receivable 
our five largest customers represented approximately  and of consolidated gross revenues for the years ended december   and  and and of consolidated accounts receivable at december  and respectively 
we have had a longstanding relationship with each of these entities and have always collected open receivable balances 
however  the loss of any of these customers could have an adverse impact on our operations 
concentration of cash at various times of the year and at december   we had a concentration of cash in one bank in excess of prevailing insurance offered through the federal deposit insurance corporation at such institution 
management does not consider the excess deposits to be a significant risk 
fair value of financial instruments the carrying amount of cash approximates its fair value 
the fair value of long term debt is based on current rates at which we could borrow funds with similar remaining maturities  and the carrying amount approximates fair value 
income taxes we file consolidated federal and state income tax returns 
we have adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the temporary differences included therein are attributable to differing methods of reflecting depreciation and stock based compensation for financial statement and income tax purposes 
trademarks  trade names and patents the star brite trade name and trademark were purchased in for  the cost of such intangible assets was amortized on a straight line basis over an estimated useful life of years through december  effective january  and pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 we have determined that the carrying value of such intangible assets relating to its star brite brand does not require further amortization 
in addition  we own two patents that we believe are valuable in limited product lines  but not material to our success or competitiveness in general 
there are no capitalized costs of these two patents 
translation of canadian currency the accounts of our canadian subsidiary are translated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 which requires that foreign currency assets and liabilities be translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
results of operations are translated using the average exchange rate prevailing throughout the period 
the effects of unrealized exchange rate fluctuations on translating foreign currency assets and liabilities into us dollars are accumulated as the translation adjustment in shareholders equity 
realized gains and losses from foreign currency transactions  if any  are included in net earnings of the period

liquidity and capital resources the amount of short term borrowings outstanding at december  was million dollars 
this is a reduction of million from the december   balance of million dollars 
during the year ended december  the company focused on programs to more effectively manage working capital 
accounts receivable at december  and aggregated approximately million dollars 
however in  net sales increased million or without a comparative increase in accounts receivable 
in addition inventory levels decreased  from million dollars to million dollars  comparing december  and  a decrease of approximately  on a increase in sales 
the company also reduced its accounts payable at december  to thousand dollars from million dollars  a decrease of or thousand dollars  in addition to reducing short term borrowings  discussed above 
as a result of the above  the company improved its current ratio  to at december   compared to at december  as of december  the company was in compliance with its debt covenants 
the primary sources of our liquidity are our operations and short term borrowings from regions bank pursuant to a revolving line of credit aggregating million 
such line matures may   bears interest at the day libor plus basis points approximately at december  and is secured by our trade receivables  inventory and intangible assets 
we are required to maintain a minimum working capital of million and meet certain other financial covenants during the term of the agreement 
as of december   we were obligated under this arrangement in the amount of  in connection with the purchase and expansion of the alabama facility  we closed on industrial development bonds during the proceeds were utilized for both the repayment of certain advances used to purchase the alabama facility and to expand such facility for our future needs 
during july  we completed a second industrial development bond financing aggregating million through the city of montgomery  alabama 
such transaction funded an approximate  square foot addition to the manufacturing facility as well as the remaining machinery and equipment additions required therein 
this project was substantially completed during in order to market the industrial development bonds at favorable rates  we obtained a substitute irrevocable letter of credit for the issue and a new irrevocable letter of credit for the issue 
under such letters of credit agreements maturing on july   we are required to maintain a stipulated level of working capital  a designated maximum debt to tangible ratio  and a required debt service coverage ratio 
such letters of credit are secured by a first priority mortgage on the underlying alabama facility and equipment 
the bonds are marketed weekly at the prevailing rates for such tax exempt instruments 
during the year ended december  such bonds carried interest ranging between and annually 
interest and principal are payable quarterly 
we believe current operations are sufficient to meet these obligations 
on april  we entered into a financing obligation with regions bank whereby they advanced us  to finance equipment acquisitions at our kinpak facility 
such obligation is due in monthly installments of principal aggregating approximately  plus interest at prevailing rates 
the outstanding balance and interest rate on this obligation at december  was approximately  and the prime rate plus per annum or 
such obligation matures on april  on november   our president and ceo  peter g 
dornau indicated that he was exercising his right to convert our indebtedness to him into common stock pursuant to the terms of the subordinated revolving line of credit he entered into with the company 
our total long term debt was reduced and shareholders equity was increased by approximately  respectively 
net income and related earnings per share for the year ended december  was not materially impacted by this event 
we are involved in making sales in the canadian market and must deal with the currency fluctuations of the canadian currency 
we do not engage in currency hedging and deal with such currency risk as a pricing issue 
during the past few years  we have introduced various new products to our customers 
at times this has required us to carry greater amounts of overall inventory and has resulted in lower inventory turnover rates 
the effects of such inventory turnover have not been material to our overall operations 
we believe that all required capital to maintain such increases can continue to be provided by operations and current financing arrangements 
many of the raw materials that we use in the manufacturing process are commodities that are subject to fluctuating prices 
we react to long term increases by passing along all or a portion of such increases to our customers as it is deemed appropriate 
as of december  and through the date hereof  we did not and do not have any material commitments for capital expenditures  nor do we have any other present commitment that is likely to result in our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way 
in addition  except for our need for additional capital to finance inventory purchases  we know of no trend  additional demand  event or uncertainty that will result in  or that is reasonably likely to result in  our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way 
the cost of petroleum and related products  major components in many of our products  which were already in an increasing cost spiral  became even more unstable in the practical dynamics of our business do not afford us the same pricing flexibility with our customers  available to our suppliers 
we cannot as immediately as our suppliers pass along the price increases to our national retailers and distributors 
we effectuated a sales price increase which became effective during the fourth quarter of in addition  we have alerted customers who purchase products  which are heavily dependent on this petroleum related issue  that we will be more responsive to commodity pricing and they must be receptive to short term price swings or accept our refusal to ship at previously established pricing 
results of operations years ended december  and for the year ended december   compared to december  both revenue and profits increased principally due to the factors enumerated below 
net sales increased to million from million  an increase of million or 
this was primarily due to an increase in sales volume to a major customer west marine  partially offset by a decrease in sales to other customers 
in certain instances the company was able to pass along price increases to customers reflecting higher material costs incurred during the year 
net sales for the year also benefited from a reduction of sales allowance programs offered to customers 
as a result  sales allowances decreased from to of gross sales 
cost of sales and gross margins for the year  gross profit increased approximately million or  increasing from approximately million in  to approximately million in cost of sales decreased as a percentage of sales as a result of management actions taken during specifically  management was more proactive in passing on cost increases to customers where possible resulting from higher raw material costs from suppliers 
in addition  newly initiated manufacturing efficiencies and the increased volume produced at the kinpak plant significantly contributed to the improved gross margins 
corporate management continues its oversight relating to both our procurement cost of raw materials as well as the overall management of our manufacturing facility 
we believe that these management actions have had a major impact in the improvement of our gross margins in operating expenses for the year  operating expenses aggregated approximately million dollars  a decrease of  from the primary decrease was in the selling and administrative expenses decreasing  the decrease reflects a reduction in staff and other cost control programs implemented during the year 
in addition advertising expenses decreased as a percent of sales from of net sales in to of net sales in  reflecting management s decision to be more selective in approving advertising programs  where it was believed the company would receive a higher benefit 
these expenses were partially offset by higher interest costs of approximately  increasing to  from approximately  the higher interest cost reflects the higher level of interest rates during the year compared to operating profit 
operating profits increased to  in from an operating loss of approximately million in  an increase of million 
net income increased to approximately  in  from a net loss of approximately million in years ended december  and sales and earnings varied when comparing the year ended december  to principally due to the factors enumerated below 
net sales decreased to approximately  for the year ended december  compared to approximately  for the year ended december  management attributes such decrease significantly to our largest customer adopting a policy of reducing their inventory levels  the unusually cold weather earlier in the year in various regions of our country resulting in a delay in the start of the recreational boating season  and the hurricanes experienced during the third and fourth quarters of this year 
cost of goods sold increased to of net sales for the year ended december  compared to of net sales for the year ended december  such increase is attributed to increasing raw material costs and the impact of spreading fixed overhead items to a reduced level of sales 
advertising and promotion expenses increased approximately  or for the period when compared to comparable expenses in the same time period in the previous year 
this resulted primarily from planned increases in media and co op advertising programs for the current year 
selling and administrative expenses  as restated  increased by approximately  or for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  such change was primarily due to increased personnel costs and other normal recurring increases in operating expenses offset by the recognition compensation cost associated with the modification of certain stock options during with no comparable item in interest expense for the year ended december  increased approximately  when compared to this resulted from increasing interest rates and higher levels of borrowing under our working capital line of credit and other financing obligations 
our loss before income taxes was approximately  for the year ended december  compared to a pre tax profit  as restated of approximately  for the year ended december  our estimated benefit from income taxes amounted to approximately  for the year ended december   and reflects available tax net loss carry back provisions based on the operations of the company as well as the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities attributable to timing differences between our book and income tax methods of accounting that are anticipated to reverse during the available carryover period 
as a result of the foregoing  our net loss amounted to approximately  for the year ended december  compared to a net income  as restated of approximately  for the year ended december  contractual obligations the following table reflects our contractual obligations for the years ended december  caption

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we do not engage in derivative transactions 
we become exposed to foreign currency transactions as a result of our operations in canada and we do not hedge such exposure 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the interest rate on our bonds 
the interest rates on our bonds adjusted weekly and ranged between and during the year ended december
