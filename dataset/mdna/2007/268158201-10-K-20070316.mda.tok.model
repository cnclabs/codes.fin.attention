our colorectal cancer and hepatitis b therapy trials and our preclinical hepatitis c therapeutic program are funded by symphony dynamo  inc recent developments heplisav heplisav  our product candidate for hepatitis b prophylaxis  completed a phase trial conducted in singapore in adults years of age and older who are more difficult to immunize with conventional vaccines 
results from the final analysis of this trial showed statistically significant superiority in protective antibody response and robustness of protective effect after three vaccinations when compared to glaxosmithkline s engerix b 
we intend to focus our development activities and resources on maximizing the potential of the 
table of contents demonstrated superiority of heplisav over conventional hepatitis b vaccine in adults  and its potential in the worldwide dialysis market 
in november  we announced results from a phase trial for heplisav in an older  more difficult to immunize population in asia showing statistically significant superiority in protective antibody response and robustness of protective effect after three vaccinations when compared to glaxosmithkline s engerix b 
in december  we announced the results of a phase trial showing equivalent seroprotection from a shorter two dose vaccination schedule in subjects to years of age 
a us based phase trial in patients with end stage renal disease is ongoing 
we have planned additional trials designed to support registration activities 
in december  we initiated a pivotal phase safety and efficacy trial for heplisav in subjects to years of age in canada followed by the planned initiation of parallel trial sites in the us and europe in also in  we anticipate initiating a phase trial in the end stage renal disease population that would be conducted in europe and or canada 
tolamba tolamba amb a iss conjugate  or aic is an injectable product candidate to treat ragweed allergy 
in april  we initiated the dynavax allergic rhinitis tolamba trial  or dartt 
the dartt study was a center  placebo controlled study that enrolled ragweed allergic subjects  aged to years 
the study randomized subjects into three arms prior dosing regimen  a higher total dose regimen  and placebo 
subjects received six doses of tolamba over six weeks prior to the start of the ragweed season 
in february  we reported that the analysis of interim one year data from dartt indicated that no meaningful ragweed specific allergic disease was observed in the overall study population  making it impossible to measure the therapeutic effect of tolamba treatment 
in all three arms of the study  including the placebo arm  minimal change from baseline was observed in the total nasal symptom scores  or tnss 
in the placebo and treated groups  the change from baseline tnss was very low  not clinically significant  and substantially lower than what has been observed in prior trials 
entry criteria for the dartt study  including a clinical history of ragweed allergy and a confirmatory skin test did not reproducibly select patients with moderate to severe disease 
the same enrollment criteria were used in a subject clinical trial of tolamba in ragweed allergic children  the primary endpoint of which was improvement in allergy symptoms following the second ragweed season 
the results of the pediatric trial showed an even lower incidence of ragweed specific allergic disease in children 
given the low level of disease in the trials study populations  we believe the planned second and third year follow up analyses for dartt and the pediatric trial are unlikely to yield valuable data  and as a result  we have decided to discontinue both studies 
a pre specified regional analysis demonstrated that sites in the midwest comprising over half the dartt study population did include patients with more pronounced ragweed symptoms 
in this group  the therapeutic benefit of tolamba in reducing total nasal symptom scores was evident  as reflected in a clinically meaningful reduction of tnss in the treated patients 
the data provide a rationale for continuing to evaluate our tlr based approach for treating ragweed and other allergic diseases 
results from a two year phase clinical trial of tolamba showed that patients treated with a single six week course of tolamba prior to the season experienced a statistically significant reduction in total nasal symptom scores and other efficacy endpoints compared to placebo treated patients in the trial 
the safety profile of tolamba was favorable 
systemic side effects were indistinguishable from placebo and local injection site tenderness was minor and transient 
we are currently in the process of evaluating the feasibility of new trial designs  defining a regulatory path  and projecting the timeline and costs  including partnership opportunities  associated with advancing the tolamba program 
symphony dynamo  inc in april  we entered into a series of related agreements with symphony capital partners  lp to advance specific dynavax iss based programs for cancer therapy  hepatitis b therapy and hepatitis c therapy through certain stages of clinical development 
pursuant to the agreements  symphony dynamo  inc sdi 
table of contents agreed to invest million to fund the clinical development of these programs and we licensed to sdi our intellectual property rights related to these programs 
sdi is a wholly owned subsidiary of symphony dynamo holdings llc  or holdings  which provided million in funding to sdi at closing  and which is obligated to fund an additional million in one year following closing 
we are primarily responsible for the development of these programs 
pursuant to the agreements  we issued to holdings a five year warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share  representing a premium over the day trading range average of per share 
the warrant exercise price is subject to reduction to per share under certain circumstances 
the warrant may be exercised or surrendered for a cash payment upon consummation of an all cash merger or acquisition of dynavax  the obligation for which would be settled by the surviving entity 
in consideration for the warrant  we received an exclusive purchase option to acquire all of the programs through the purchase of all of the equity in sdi during the five year term at specified prices 
the purchase option exercise price is payable in cash or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock  at our sole discretion 
we also have an option to purchase either the hepatitis b or hepatitis c program during the first year of the agreement 
the program option is exercisable at our sole discretion at a price which is payable in cash only and will be fully creditable against the exercise price for any subsequent exercise of the purchase option 
if we do not exercise our exclusive right to purchase some or all of the programs licensed under the agreement  the intellectual property rights to the programs at the end of the development period will remain with sdi 
in cancer  we believe that the potent and multifaceted biological activities of iss offer a number of distinct approaches to cancer therapy in a wide range of tumor types 
in december  we initiated a phase dose escalation clinical trial of our cancer product candidate in combination with a standard chemotherapeutic regimen for metastatic colorectal cancer 
in march  we initiated a phase trial of our therapy for chronic hepatitis b virus hbv infection 
we anticipate that additional cancer product candidates will advance into clinical trials in solid tumors in  and our hepatitis c therapeutic product candidate is also planned to enter the clinic in iss for non hodgkin s lymphoma we have an ongoing phase study in non hodgkin s lymphoma  or nhl  of iss in combination with rituxan tm rituximab 
in december  we announced preliminary data from this phase study based on patients with histologically confirmed cd  b cell follicular nhl who had relapsed after at least one prior treatment regimen for lymphoma 
patients treated with the combination therapy showed a prolonged time to progression as compared to patients who were less responsive to the drug and to historical controls 
the combination of rituximab and our iss was well tolerated  and adverse events were minimal 
we previously reported a phase  dose escalation trial of our iss in combination with rituximab in patients with nhl in which dose dependent pharmacological activity was demonstrated without significant toxicity 
astrazeneca research collaboration and license agreement in september  we entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with astrazeneca for the discovery and development of tlr agonist based therapies for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  or copd 
the collaboration is using our proprietary second generation tlr agonist immunostimulatory sequences or iss 
under the terms of the agreement  we are collaborating with astrazeneca to identify lead tlr agonists and conduct appropriate research phase studies 
astrazeneca is responsible for any development and worldwide commercialization of products arising out of the research program 
we have the option to co promote in the united states products arising from the collaboration 
influenza vaccine in the fourth quarter of  we announced preclinical data that show our influenza flu vaccine can improve the immunogenicity of standard flu vaccines 
the data from mouse and primate models demonstrated that co administration of our flu vaccine with standard vaccine enhances the immune response of the standard 
table of contents vaccine  allows reduction of standard vaccine dosage  and provides extra layers of protection that are not strain dependent 
our flu vaccine is based on our proprietary tlr agonist based iss technology 
the preclinical work was funded in part by a research and development grant for a pandemic flu vaccine from the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases  a division of the national institutes of health 
the immune system the immune system is the body s natural defense mechanism against infectious pathogens  such as bacteria  viruses and parasites  and plays an important role in identifying and eliminating abnormal cells  such as cancer cells 
the body s first line of defense against any foreign substance is a specialized function called innate immunity  which serves as a rapid response that protects the body during the days or weeks needed for a second longer term immune response  termed adaptive immunity  to develop 
unique cells called dendritic cells have two key functions in the innate immune response 
they produce molecules called cytokines that contribute to the killing of viruses and bacteria 
in addition  they ensure that pathogens and other foreign substances are made highly visible to specialized helper t cells  called th and th cells  which coordinate the longer term adaptive immune response 
dendritic cells recognize different types of pathogens or offending substances and are able to guide the immune system to make the most appropriate type of response 
when viruses  bacteria and abnormal cells such as cancer cells are encountered  dendritic cells trigger a th response  whereas detection of a parasite infection leads dendritic cells to initiate a th response 
th and th responses last for extended periods of time in the form of th and th memory cells  conferring long term immunity 
immune system the diagram above is a visual representation of how the immune system reacts when it encounters antigen 
upon encountering antigen  a cascade of events is initiated that leads to either a th or a th immune response  as described more fully in the paragraphs above 
the th response involves the production of specific cytokines  including interferon alpha  interferon gamma and interleukin  or il  as well as the generation of killer t cells  a specialized immune cell 
these cytokines and killer t cells are believed to be the body s most potent anti infective weapons 
in addition  protective igg antibodies are generated that also help rid the body of foreign antigens and allergens 
once a population of th cells specific to a particular antigen or allergen is produced  it persists for a long period of time in the form of memory th cells  even if the antigen or allergen target is eliminated 
if another infection by the same pathogen occurs  the immune system is able to react more quickly and powerfully to the infection  because the memory th cells can reproduce immediately 
when the th response to an infection is 
table of contents insufficient  chronic disease can result 
when the th response is inappropriate  diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis can result  in part from elevated levels of th cytokines 
activation of the th response results in the production of other cytokines  il  il and il these cytokines attract inflammatory cells such as eosinophils  basophils and mast cells capable of destroying the invading organism 
in addition  the th response leads to the production of a specialized antibody  ige 
ige has the ability to recognize foreign antigens and allergens and further enhances the protective response 
an inappropriate activation of the th immune response to allergens  such as plant pollens  can lead to chronic inflammation and result in allergic rhinitis  asthma and other allergic diseases 
this inflammation is sustained by memory th cells that are reactivated upon subsequent exposures to the allergen  leading to a chronic disease 
iss and the immune system our principal product development efforts are based on a technology that uses short synthetic dna molecules called iss that stimulate a th immune response while suppressing th immune responses 
we are using a proprietary iss  a base synthetic dna molecule called iss  in our clinical development programs for ragweed allergy  hepatitis b prophylaxis  asthma and cancer 
iss contain specialized sequences that activate the innate immune system 
iss are recognized by a specialized subset of dendritic cells containing a unique receptor called toll like receptor  or tlr the interaction of tlr with iss triggers the biological events that lead to the suppression of the th immune response and the enhancement of the th immune response 
we believe iss have the following benefits iss work by changing or reprogramming the immune responses that cause disease rather than just treating the symptoms of disease 
iss influence helper t cell responses in a targeted and highly specific way by redirecting the response of only those t cells involved in a given disease 
as a result  iss do not alter the ability of the immune system to mount an appropriate response to infecting pathogens 
in addition  because tlr is found only in a specialized subset of dendritic cells  iss do not cause a generalized activation of the immune system  which might otherwise give rise to an autoimmune response 
iss  in conjunction with an allergen or antigen  establish populations of memory th cells  allowing the immune system to respond appropriately to each future encounter with a specific pathogen or allergen  leading to long lasting therapeutic effects 
we have developed a number of proprietary iss compositions and formulations that make use of the different ways in which the innate immune system responds to iss 
depending on the indication for which iss is being explored as a therapy  we use iss in different ways 
iss linked to allergens we link iss to allergens that are known to cause specific allergies 
by chemically linking iss to allergens  rather than simply mixing them  we generate a superior th response due to the fact that the iss and allergen are presented simultaneously to the same part of the immune system 
the linked molecules generate an increased th response by the immune system in the form of igg antibodies and interferon gamma 
in addition  the iss linked allergens have a highly specific and potent inhibitory effect on the th cells  thereby reprogramming the immune response away from the th response that causes specific allergies 
upon subsequent natural exposure to the allergens  the th memory response is triggered and may provide long term suppression of allergic responses 
iss linked to or combined with antigens we also link iss to antigens associated with pathogens such as viruses and bacteria to stimulate an immune response that will attack and destroy infected or abnormal cells 
iss  linked to or combined with appropriate antigens  increase the visibility of the antigen to the immune system and induce a highly specific 
table of contents and enhanced th response  including increased igg antibody production 
as with iss linked to allergens  this treatment also generates memory t cells that confer long term protection against specific pathogens 
this treatment may also have the potential for synergy with other cancer or infectious disease therapies 
iss alone we use iss alone in diseases like asthma  where a large variety of allergens may be associated with an inappropriate immune response 
iss administered alone may suppress the th inflammatory response caused by any number of allergens  modifying the underlying cause of inflammation  as well as providing symptomatic relief 
iss may also be used in conjunction with a variety of anti tumor monoclonal antibodies and chemotherapy agents as a combination therapy  with the goal of stimulating the elimination of cancer cells 
advanced iss technologies we have developed proprietary technologies that modify the molecular structure of iss to significantly increase its versatility and potency 
we are using these technologies in most of our preclinical programs and believe that they will be essential to our future product development efforts 
our advanced iss technologies include iss like compounds  which we call cics  as well as advanced iss formulations 
cics are molecules that are a mixture of nucleotide and non nucleotide components 
we have identified optimal sequences that induce particular immune responses  including potent interferon alpha induction 
cics can be tailored to have specific immunostimulatory properties and can be administered alone  or linked to allergens or antigens 
we have also developed formulations for iss and cics that can dramatically increase their potency 
these advanced formulations can be used in situations where high potency is required to see a desired clinical outcome and can decrease the dosage of iss or cics required to achieve therapeutic effect 
our primary development programs our primary development programs are hepatitis b products  allergy immunotherapy  cancer and chronic inflammation  as described below 
hepatitis b products hepatitis b prevention heplisav our hepatitis b vaccine product candidate and its benefits current hepatitis b vaccines consist of hepatitis b surface antigen combined with alum as an adjuvant 
heplisav is composed of hepatitis b surface antigen combined with iss and  unlike conventional three dose vaccines  appears to require only two immunizations over two months to achieve protective hepatitis b antibody responses in healthy young adults 
in addition  clinical studies have demonstrated that heplisav offers higher levels of immunity in the age population  which traditionally responds poorly to current vaccines 
therefore  we believe heplisav may offer an efficacy advantage versus currently available vaccines for patients that are traditionally difficult to immunize  including pre dialysis  hiv or hcv infected individuals 
our commercial strategy for heplisav is designed to target high value  high risk patient populations whose need for rapid and effective protection against hbv is urgent and who are underserved by conventional vaccines 
we are initially focusing on patients with chronic renal failure who are either about to undergo hemodialysis or are already on hemodialysis  and who are at substantial risk for hbv infection 
we also intend to focus on people with hiv and hepatitis c infections for whom co infection with hbv is a serious concern 
we believe that healthcare workers and emergency personnel  who face significant occupational risks of infection  as well as discretionary travelers  also represent important potential markets for heplisav 

table of contents clinical status results from phase and from phase trials showed that heplisav was well tolerated and induced more rapid immunity with fewer immunizations in both healthy young and older adults than glaxosmithkline s engerix b 
our phase trial investigated the effects of escalating doses of iss  from mg to mg  in each case administered with the same amount of hepatitis b surface antigen as used in conventional vaccines 
in this trial we enrolled subjects and demonstrated that all subjects who received two injections of at least mg iss with hepatitis b surface antigen achieved protective hepatitis b antibody responses 
we conducted a phase trial in canada evaluating the efficacy of two injections of heplisav hepatitis b surface antigen plus mg of iss compared to engerix b 
a total of healthy young adults were enrolled in this study  randomized to our vaccine or engerix b 
results showed that heplisav induced a rate of protective hepatitis b antibody response after one injection and protective hepatitis b antibody response in of recipients after the second injection at two months 
in contrast  subjects receiving engerix b had protective hepatitis b antibody responses after the first and second injections in and of recipients  respectively 
we completed a phase trial in singapore that evaluated the efficacy of our vaccine in older subjects ages years who have a diminished ability to respond to current commercial vaccines 
results showed superiority of heplisav compared to engerix b relative to the primary efficacy endpoint of seroprotection seroprotection in the heplisav treated group compared to in the engerix b treated group  p and relative to geometric mean concentration or gmc compared to miu ml  p 
results also showed that subjects treated with heplisav experienced more durable seroprotection 
at week  the heplisav treated group measured seroprotection and gmc of miu ml compared to and miu ml for the engerix b treated group p and p  respectively 
the primary endpoint of the trial was seroprotection following three doses  and a key secondary endpoint was gmc  a measure of the robustness of antibody response 
the safety profile of the vaccine was highly favorable 
in november  we announced results from a phase trial for heplisav in an older  more difficult to immunize population in asia showing statistically significant superiority in protective antibody response and robustness of protective effect after three vaccinations when compared to engerix b 
the data showed that after three doses  heplisav provided seroprotection to of subjects versus for engerix b p 
the greatest difference in seroprotection after three doses was seen in subjects to years of age where heplisav provided seroprotection and engerix b provided 
data for the entire study population showed that after two doses  heplisav provided seroprotection versus engerix b s 
furthermore  heplisav provided a level of immunity as measured by geometric mean concentrations of anti hbsag antibodies times higher than engerix b four weeks after the third dose 
the phase trial enrolled more than seronegative subjects  to years of age  at study sites in singapore  korea and the philippines 
one group of subjects received three doses of heplisav  the other group received three doses of engerix b 
in december  we announced the results of a phase trial showing equivalent seroprotection from a shorter two dose vaccination schedule in the younger adult population 
the data showed that seroprotection is achieved whether the second dose is administered one or two months after the first 
of all subjects were seroprotected at month three and all subjects sustained seroprotection at month eight 
heplisav was found to be safe and well tolerated 
the phase trial enrolled more than seronegative subjects  to years of age  at one study site in canada 
one group of subjects received heplisav at and month  the other group received heplisav at and months 
a us based phase trial in patients with end stage renal disease is ongoing 
we have planned additional trials designed to support registration activities 
in december  we initiated a pivotal phase safety and efficacy trial for heplisav in subjects to years of age in canada followed by the planned initiation of parallel trial sites in the us and europe in also in  we anticipate initiating a phase trial in the end stage renal disease population that would be conducted in europe and or canada 

table of contents commercial opportunity hepatitis b is a common chronic infectious disease with an estimated million chronic carriers worldwide 
prevention of hepatitis caused by hbv is central to managing the spread of the disease  particularly in regions of the world with large numbers of chronically infected individuals 
while many countries have instituted infant vaccination programs  compliance is not optimal 
moreover  there are large numbers of individuals  born prior to the implementation of these programs  who are unvaccinated and are at risk for the disease 
in addition  not all individuals respond to currently approved vaccines 
annual sales of hepatitis b vaccines are approximately billion globally 
supervax in april  we completed the acquisition of rhein biotech gmbh  which we refer to as dynavax europe 
as a result  we acquired a hepatitis b vaccine called supervax that has been tested in more than subjects and has demonstrated safety and seroprotection when administered on a two dose schedule 
supervax was launched in argentina in december and is approved for marketing and sales through a third party partner 
we intend to continue registration activities for supervax as a two dose vaccine for adolescents for commercialization through partners in select countries outside of north america and europe 
current hepatitis b vaccines and their limitations current hepatitis b vaccines consist of a three dose immunization regimen administered over six months 
if completed  current hepatitis b vaccination confers protective hepatitis b antibody responses to approximately of healthy young adults 
however  the protective hepatitis b antibody responses achieved by conventional vaccines is lower for persons who are immunocompromised 
additionally  there is an inversely proportional relationship between age and the degree to which current vaccines confer protective hepatitis b antibody responses the older you are  the less effective current vaccines are 
compliance with the immunization regimen is also a significant issue  as many patients fail to receive all three doses 
according to a survey of us adolescents and adults published by the centers for disease control  of those who received the first dose of vaccine  only received the second dose of vaccine and only received the third 
we believe that compliance rates in other countries are similar or worse 
for healthy young adults  protective hepatitis b antibody responses after the first dose are reported to be between and and improve to only to after the second dose 
consequently  an unacceptably large number of individuals who start the immunization series remain susceptible to infection 
poor field efficacy is of particular concern in regions with high hepatitis b prevalence and constitutes a major public health issue 
hepatitis b therapy benefits of our approach to hepatitis b therapy our hepatitis b therapeutic candidate may provide a more effective alternative for the elimination of infection in chronic carriers  in conjunction with existing antiviral therapies 
our immunotherapy is expected to induce a potent immune response against virus infected cells in the liver and has the potential to eradicate the infection 
clinical status in march  we initiated a phase trial of our therapy for chronic hbv infection 
we intend to enroll healthy subjects to evaluate the safety of the therapy at two dosing schedules 
the therapy combines the surface and core antigen of hbv manufactured at dynavax europe 
the trial is funded by sdi and we anticipate results from the trial in the second half of commercial opportunity hepatitis b infection is a major cause of acute and chronic viral hepatitis  with morbidities ranging from asymptomatic infection to liver failure  cancer and death 
there is a large population chronically infected with 
table of contents hepatitis b  including an estimated one million patients in the us  two million in europe  nine million in japan and three hundred fifty million in the rest of the world 
in many countries in southeast asia and the pacific basin  hbv endemicity is as high as of the population 
currently available hepatitis b therapies and their limitations currently available therapies for chronic hepatitis b infection include interferon alpha and antiviral drugs 
interferon alpha has been shown to normalize liver enzyme function in approximately of individuals treated 
the approved antiviral drugs  which work by inhibiting viral replication  reduce hepatitis b viral load approximately  fold and normalize liver enzymes in to of patients 
however  in most cases the hepatitis b virus reappears when the antiviral drugs are discontinued 
both interferon alpha and antiviral drugs are expensive and may induce significant side effects 
in addition  patients typically become resistant to antiviral drugs as early as one year after initiating treatment  potentially rendering them ineffective as long term therapies 
allergy immunotherapy ragweed allergy tolamba for ragweed allergy and its benefits tolamba consists of iss linked to the purified major allergen of ragweed called amb a tolamba may target the underlying cause of seasonal allergic rhinitis caused by ragweed and offers a six week treatment regimen potentially capable of providing long lasting therapeutic results 
the linking of iss to amb a ensures that both iss and ragweed allergen are presented simultaneously to the same immune cells  producing a highly specific and potent inhibitory effect 
preclinical data suggest that th cells responsible for inflammation associated with ragweed allergy are suppressed  leading to reprogramming of the immune response away from the th response and toward a th memory response so that  upon subsequent natural exposure to the ragweed allergen  long term immunity is achieved 
clinical status over the last several years  tolamba has been tested in fifteen clinical trials in the us  france and canada  and more than  tolamba injections have been administered to more than  patients 
in these trials  tolamba was shown to be safe and well tolerated 
in april  we initiated the dynavax allergic rhinitis tolamba trial  or dartt 
the dartt study was a center  placebo controlled study that enrolled ragweed allergic subjects  aged to years 
the study randomized subjects into three arms prior dosing regimen  a higher total dose regimen  and placebo 
subjects received six doses of tolamba over six weeks prior to the start of the ragweed season 
in february  we reported that the analysis of interim one year data from dartt indicated that no meaningful ragweed specific allergic disease was observed in the overall study population  making it impossible to measure the therapeutic effect of tolamba treatment 
in all three arms of the study  including the placebo arm  minimal change from baseline was observed in the tnss 
in the placebo and treated groups  the change from baseline tnss was very low  not clinically significant  and substantially lower than what has been observed in prior trials 
entry criteria for the dartt study  including a clinical history of ragweed allergy and a confirmatory skin test did not reproducibly select patients with moderate to severe disease 
the same enrollment criteria were used in a subject clinical trial of tolamba in ragweed allergic children  the primary endpoint of which was improvement in allergy symptoms following the second ragweed season 
the results of the pediatric trial showed an even lower incidence of ragweed specific allergic disease in children 
given the low level of disease in the trials study populations  we believe the planned second and third year follow up analyses for dartt and the pediatric trial are unlikely to yield valuable data  and as a result  we have decided to discontinue both studies 
a pre specified regional analysis demonstrated that sites in the midwest comprising over half the dartt study population did include patients with more pronounced ragweed symptoms 
in this group  the therapeutic 
table of contents benefit of tolamba in reducing total nasal symptom scores was evident  as reflected in a clinically meaningful reduction of tnss in the treated patients 
the data provide a rationale for continuing to evaluate our tlr based approach for treating ragweed and other allergic diseases 
results from a two year phase clinical trial of tolamba showed that patients treated with a single six week course of tolamba prior to the season experienced a statistically significant reduction in total nasal symptom scores and other efficacy endpoints compared to placebo treated patients in the trial 
the safety profile of tolamba was favorable 
systemic side effects were indistinguishable from placebo and local injection site tenderness was minor and transient 
we are currently in the process of evaluating the feasibility of new trial designs  defining a regulatory path  and projecting the timeline and costs  including partnership opportunities  associated with advancing the tolamba program 
commercial opportunity medical management of seasonal allergic rhinitis is a multibillion dollar global market 
in the us alone  approximately million people suffer from allergic rhinitis 
the direct costs of prescription interventions for allergic rhinitis in the us were billion in ragweed is the single most common seasonal allergen  affecting up to of those with allergic rhinitis  or million americans 
in addition  of those who suffer from allergic rhinitis progress to asthma  leading to increased morbidity and disease management costs 
we believe that a significant market opportunity exists for tolamba in the treatment of ragweed allergic individuals currently undergoing conventional immunotherapy or using multiple prescription or over the counter otc medications 
in addition  the product may also play a role in earlier stage disease  potentially preventing the allergic march from allergic rhinitis to asthma 
current allergy treatments and their limitations drug treatments many individuals turn to prescription and otc pharmacotherapies such as antihistamines  corticosteroids  anti leukotriene agents and decongestants to manage their allergy symptoms 
although currently available pharmacotherapies may provide temporary symptomatic relief  they can be inconvenient to use and can cause side effects 
most importantly  these pharmacotherapies need to be administered chronically and do not modify the underlying disease state 
allergy shots immunotherapy allergy shots  or immunotherapy  are employed to alter the underlying immune mechanisms that cause allergic rhinitis 
patients are recommended for allergy immunotherapy only after attempts to reduce allergic symptoms by drugs or limiting exposure to the allergen have been deemed inadequate 
conventional immunotherapy is a gradual immunizing process in which increasing individualized concentrations of pollen extracts are mixed by the allergist and administered to induce increased tolerance to natural allergen exposure 
the treatment regimen generally consists of weekly injections over the course of six months to a year  during which the dosing is gradually built up to a therapeutic level so as not to induce a severe allergic reaction 
once a therapeutic dosing level is reached  individuals then receive bi weekly or monthly injections to build and maintain immunity over another two to four years 
a patient typically receives between and injections over the course of treatment 
adverse reactions to conventional allergy immunotherapy are common and can range from minor swelling at the injection site to systemic reactions  and  in extremely rare instances  death 
other major drawbacks from the patients perspective include the inconvenience of repeated visits to doctors offices for each injection  the time lag between the initiation of the regimen and the reduction of symptoms  and the total number of injections required to achieve a therapeutic effect 
consequently  patient compliance is a significant issue 
other allergy immunotherapy candidates we may produce similar iss allergen linked product candidates for the treatment of other major allergies 
each of grass  birch and cedar induced seasonal allergic rhinitis is caused by an allergic immune system response to identified and characterized allergens 
consequently  product candidates for each can be produced in a manner similar to tolamba 
for example  the major grass allergens  lol p and ph p  and the 
table of contents major cedar tree allergens  cry j and cry j  can be linked to iss 
we believe our approach may provide distinct advantages over conventional immunotherapy for these allergies  including a potentially favorable safety profile  significantly shorter dosing regimen and long term therapeutic benefits 
we believe that our additional allergy products may present the same advantages over symptomatic interventions as described for tolamba 
as a result of these advantages and by providing a broader set of allergy immunotherapies  we may ultimately achieve an expansion into the large group of patients that currently choose pharmacotherapies over existing immunotherapies 
peanut allergy iss for peanut allergy and its benefits we believe that iss linked with a major peanut allergen  ara h  may be able to suppress the th response and reduce or eliminate the allergic reaction without inducing anaphylaxis during the course of immunotherapy 
our anticipated advantage in this area is the potentially increased safety that may be achieved by linking iss to the allergen 
by using iss to block recognition of the allergen by ige and therefore prevent subsequent histamine release  we may be able to administer enough of the iss linked allergen to safely reprogram the immune response without inducing a dangerous allergic reaction 
we believe the resulting creation of memory th cells may provide long term protection against an allergic response due to accidental exposure to peanuts 
preclinical status we have developed a peanut allergy product candidate that consists of iss linked to a major peanut allergen  ara h we have demonstrated in mice that peanut allergen linked to iss induces much higher levels of th induced igg antibodies and lower levels of ige than natural peanut allergen 
iss linked ara h also induces much higher levels of interferon gamma and much lower levels of il than unmodified ara h in mice 
immunization with our product candidate has also been shown to protect peanut allergic animals from anaphylaxis and death following exposure to peanut allergen 
in addition  we have demonstrated that iss linked ara h has significantly reduced allergic response as measured by in vitro histamine release assays using blood cells from peanut allergic patients 
commercial opportunity peanut allergy accounts for the majority of severe food related allergic reactions 
approximately million people in the us have a potentially life threatening allergy to peanuts and the incidence is growing rapidly 
there are an estimated to deaths from severe peanut allergy in the us each year 
current peanut allergy treatments and their limitations there are currently no products available that treat peanut allergy 
people allergic to peanuts must take extreme avoidance measures  carefully monitoring their exposure to peanuts and peanut by products 
emergency response following peanut exposure and the onset of allergic symptoms primarily consists of the administration of epinephrine to treat anaphylaxis 
our peanut allergy immunotherapy is designed to allow patients to tolerate exposure to higher levels of peanut products without experiencing severe reactions 
cancer therapy benefits of our approach to cancer therapy we are developing iss and second generation tlr agonists as a potential therapy for cancer 
tlr plays a central role in immune regulation and has multiple actions that indicate a potentially significant role in cancer therapy 
these include production of interferons ifn and other cytokines such as tnf and il and activation of macrophages and nk cells 

table of contents iss has the potential to become a versatile cancer therapy that could be used broadly 
extensive study in preclinical model systems has shown positive indications that iss may offer several benefits 
iss can be used in different ways depending on patient tumor profiles  either as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy and or monoclonal antibodies 
iss may also have the potential be used to treat the full spectrum of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies due to the central role of tlr in immune regulation 
iss also has an attractive safety profile and is expected to offer fewer side effects as compared to currently available cancer therapies  increasing the likelihood of broad use 
this has been demonstrated in phase and phase studies in nhl patients conducted by dynavax and its collaborators 
clinical status in december  we initiated a phase dose escalation clinical trial of our tlr agonist in combination with a standard chemotherapeutic regimen for metastatic colorectal cancer 
the enrollment target of the trial is patients  all of whom will have been previously treated for colorectal cancer but had a recurrence of the disease 
the trial  which will be conducted at three centers in the united states  is designed to identify the optimum dose and to yield safety and tolerability data for escalating doses of our tlr agonist administered with irinotecan and cetuximab 
we anticipate that the trial  funded by sdi  will be completed in the first half of we plan to use the data to design a larger phase multi center  randomized controlled trial in metastatic colorectal cancer  which we anticipate initiating in an ongoing phase trial funded by the national institutes of health is evaluating the use of iss in combination with rituximab as a treatment for patients with non hodgkin s lymphoma 
in december  we announced preliminary data from the study which enrolled follicular lymphoma patients who had relapsed after at least one prior treatment 
patients treated with the combination therapy showed a prolonged time to progression as compared to patients who were less responsive to the drug and to historical controls 
the combination of rituximab and iss was well tolerated  and adverse events were minimal 
we previously reported a phase  dose escalation trial of iss in combination with rituximab in patients with non hodgkin s lymphoma 
in this trial  dose dependent pharmacological activity was demonstrated without significant toxicity 
commercial opportunity cancer remains one of the areas of greatest unmet medical need in medicine today 
annually  over million people are diagnosed with cancer and over  people die of the disease  making cancer the second leading cause of death in the us current therapies for cancer include surgery  chemotherapy and radiation as well as targeted agents such as antibodies and hormonal therapies 
surgery and radiation are limited to the site of the initial tumor  chemotherapy causes severe side effects and has limited effect  with high rates of recurrence 
major unmet medical needs exist for new cancer treatments that offer higher rates of efficacy with fewer side effects and that can be used alone or in combination with other therapies 
iss has the potential to become a versatile cancer therapy that could be used broadly  in multiple tumor types  alone or in combination with established standards of care 
iss has an excellent safety profile and is administered via simple subcutaneous administration  an improvement over most chemotherapy and monoclonal antibody approaches that require iv infusion 
chronic inflammation asthma inhaled iss for asthma and its benefits in most people  asthma is an inflammatory airway disease caused by multiple allergens 
as a result  an approach relying on the linkage of iss to a large number of allergens would be technically and commercially challenging 
to address this issue  we have formulated iss for pulmonary delivery with no linked allergen  relying on natural exposure to multiple allergens that may produce specific long term immunity 
once the immune response to asthma causing allergens has been reprogrammed to a th response  it may be possible to 
table of contents reduce administrations of iss to longer periodic intervals or only as needed 
in addition  based on preclinical data  we believe that this therapy may lead to reversal of airway remodeling caused by asthma 
astrazeneca research collaboration and license agreement in september  we entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with astrazeneca for the discovery and development of tlr agonist based therapies for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  or copd 
the collaboration is using our proprietary second generation tlr agonist immunostimulatory sequences or iss 
under the terms of the agreement  we are collaborating with astrazeneca to identify lead tlr agonists and conduct appropriate research phase studies 
astrazeneca is responsible for any development and worldwide commercialization of products arising out of the research program 
we have the option to co promote in the united states products arising from the collaboration 
additional programs in addition to our primary product portfolio  we are pursuing earlier stage programs in next generation vaccines and autoimmune disorders  as described below 
next generation vaccines influenza vaccine human viral influenza is an acute respiratory disease of global dimension with high morbidity and mortality in annual epidemics 
in the us  there are an estimated  viral flu associated deaths per year 
pandemics occur infrequently  on average every years  with high rates of infection resulting in increased mortality 
the last pandemic occurred in  and virologists anticipate that a new pandemic strain could emerge any time 
current flu vaccines are directed against specific surface antigen proteins 
these proteins vary significantly each year  requiring the vaccine to be reconfigured and administered annually 
our approach links advanced iss to conserved flu antigens 
we believe that iss linked conserved antigens added to conventional vaccine will not only increase antibody responses capable of blocking viral infections but also confer protective immunity against divergent flu strains 
in the fourth quarter of  we announced preclinical data that show our flu vaccine can improve the immunogenicity of standard flu vaccines 
the data from mouse and primate models demonstrated that co administration of our flu vaccine with standard vaccine enhances the immune response of the standard vaccine  allows reduction of standard vaccine dosage  and provides extra layers of protection that are not strain dependent 
in the third quarter of we were awarded a million grant over three and a half years to fund research and development of an advanced pandemic flu vaccine under an niaid program for biodefense administered by the national institutes of health 
anthrax vaccine we are using our advanced iss technology to develop an improved anthrax vaccine that we expect will be well tolerated and provide protective immunity after one or two immunizations 
the only available anthrax vaccine  anthrax vaccine adsorbed  or ava  was approved in the us in and has been used extensively by the military 
the vaccine has been reported to cause relatively high rates of local and systemic adverse reactions 
in addition  the administration of ava requires six subcutaneous injections over months with subsequent annual boosters 
our vaccine candidate will be composed of recombinant anthrax protective antigen  or rpa  combined with advanced iss enhanced by a proprietary formulation 
the use of advanced iss in this formulation should enhance both the speed and magnitude of the antibody response developed against rpa compared to ava and other rpa based products in development 
preclinical experiments have demonstrated that rpa combined with our advanced iss formulations has generated significantly higher toxin neutralizing antibody responses compared to rpa alone or rpa combined with the standard vaccine adjuvant  alum in mouse and monkey models 
in addition  the rpa combined with advanced iss formulations has provided protection from respiratory anthrax spore challenge in mouse  guinea pig  and rabbit models 
in the third quarter of  the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases  or niaid  awarded us a 
table of contents million grant over three and a half years to fund research and development of an advanced anthrax vaccine as part of its biodefense program 
autoimmune disorders we have pioneered a new approach to treating autoimmune disease based upon a class of oligonucleotides  named immunoregulatory sequences irs  that specifically inhibit the tlr induced inflammatory response implicated in disease progression 
we are exploring development of an irs based treatment for autoimmune disease  including systemic lupus erythematosis sle or lupus 
based upon this initial research  in the fourth quarter of  the alliance for lupus research alr awarded us a million grant over two years to explore new treatment approaches for sle based on our irs technology 
intellectual property our intellectual property portfolio can be divided into our main technology areas iss  vaccines using dna and irs 
we have entered into exclusive  worldwide license agreements with the regents of the university of california for technology and related patent rights in these technology areas 
iss technology we have issued us and foreign patents  pending us patent applications  and pending foreign applications that seek worldwide coverage of compositions and methods using iss technology 
some of these patents and applications have been exclusively licensed worldwide from the regents of the university of california 
among others  we hold issued us patents covering iss as a composition of matter  the use of iss alone to treat asthma  and iss linked to allergens and viral or tumor antigens 
vaccines using dna we have issued us and foreign patents and pending us and foreign patent applications covering methods and compositions for vaccines using dna and methods for their use 
we hold an exclusive  worldwide license from the regents of the university of california for patents and patent applications relating to vaccines using dna  and we have the right to grant sublicenses to third parties 
effective january  we entered into a cross licensing agreement with vical  inc that grants each company exclusive  worldwide rights to combine the other firm s patented technology for dna immunization with its own for selected indications 
irs including immunoinhibitory sequences we have issued us and foreign patents and pending us and foreign patent applications providing worldwide rights to certain compositions and methods using irs including immunoinhibitory sequences 
we hold exclusive  worldwide licenses to these patents and patent applications held by the regents of the university of california 
under the terms of our license agreements with the regents of the university of california  we are required to pay license fees  make milestone payments and pay royalties on net sales resulting from successful products originating from the licensed technologies 
we may terminate these agreements in whole or in part on days advance notice 
the regents of the university of california may terminate these agreements if we are in breach for failure to make royalty payments  meet diligence requirements  produce required reports or fund internal research and we do not cure such breach within days after being notified of the breach 
otherwise  the agreements generally continue in effect until the last patent claiming a product licensed under the agreement or its manufacture or use expires  or in the absence of patents  until the date the last patent application claiming a licensed product is abandoned 
our commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties 
a number of pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies  including coley pharmaceutical group  or coley  as well as universities and research institutions may have filed patent applications or may have been granted patents that cover technologies similar to the technologies owned or licensed to us 
we cannot determine with certainty whether patents or patent applications of other parties may materially affect our ability to make  use or sell any products 
the existence of third party patent applications and patents could significantly reduce the coverage of the patents owned by or licensed to us and limit our 
table of contents ability to obtain meaningful patent protection 
in addition  other parties may duplicate  design around or independently develop similar or alternative technologies to ours or our licensors 
if another party controls patents or patent applications covering our products  we may not be able to obtain the rights we need to those patents or patent applications in order to commercialize our products 
we have developed second generation technology that we believe reduces many of these risks 
litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope or validity of another party s proprietary rights 
us patent office interference proceedings may be necessary if we and another party both claim to have invented the same subject matter 
coley has issued us patent claims  as well as patent claims pending with the us patent and trademark office  that  if held to be valid  could require us to obtain a license in order to commercialize one or more of our formulations of iss in the united states 
we may not prevail in any of these actions or proceedings and an adverse outcome in a court or patent office could subject us to significant liabilities  require disputed rights to be licensed from other parties  or require us to cease using some of our technology 
our policy is to require each of our employees  consultants and advisors to enter into an agreement before beginning their employment  consulting or advisory relationship with us that in general provides that the individuals must keep confidential and not disclose to other parties any of our confidential information developed or learned by the individuals during the course of their relationship with us except in limited circumstances 
these agreements also generally provide that we own all inventions conceived by the individuals in the course of rendering their employment or services to us 
manufacturing we rely on a number of third parties and our facility in d sseldorf  germany for the multiple steps involved in the manufacturing process of our product candidates  including  for example  iss  a key component material that is necessary for our product candidates  the combination of the antigens and iss  and the fill and finish 
the process for manufacturing oligonucleotides such as iss is well established and uses commercially available equipment and raw materials 
to date  we have manufactured small quantities of our oligonucleotide formulations for research purposes 
we have relied on a single supplier to produce our iss for clinical trials 
heplisav is composed of hepatitis b surface antigen combined with iss 
we currently utilize our facility in d sseldorf  germany to manufacture heplisav 
we may enter into manufacturing agreements with one or more commercial scale contract manufacturers to produce additional supplies of heplisav as required for new clinical trials and commercialization  or we may have to establish internal commercial scale manufacturing capability for heplisav  incurring increased capital and operating costs  delays in the commercial development of heplisav and higher manufacturing costs than we have experienced to date 
tolamba consists of iss linked to amb a  the principal ragweed allergen  which is purified from ragweed pollen purchased on an as needed basis from commercial suppliers of ragweed pollen 
if we are unable to purchase ragweed pollen from commercial suppliers  we may be required to contract directly with collectors of ragweed pollen which may in turn subject us to unknown pricing and supply risks 
as we develop product candidates addressing other allergies  we may face similar supply risks 
in the past  tolamba was produced for us by a single contract manufacturer 
our existing supplies of tolamba are sufficient for us to conduct our current clinical trials 
we may enter into manufacturing agreements with one or more new commercial manufacturers to produce additional supplies of tolamba if required to advance the program toward commercialization 
marketing we have no sales  marketing or distribution capability 
we intend to seek global or regional partners to help us market certain product candidates 
we are inclined to license commercial rights to larger pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies with appropriate marketing and distribution capabilities  except in instances 
table of contents where it may prove feasible to build a small direct sales organization targeting a narrow specialty or therapeutic area 
competition the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies  intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products 
many of our competitors  including biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  academic institutions and other research organizations  are actively engaged in the discovery  research and development of products that could compete directly or indirectly with our products under development 
heplisav  if approved and commercialized  will compete directly with existing  three injection vaccine products produced by merck co  inc  or merck  glaxosmithkline plc  or gsk  and crucell nv  among others 
there are also two injection hepatitis b vaccine products in clinical development  including a vaccine being developed by gsk which has been approved for marketing in the european union 
in addition  heplisav will compete against a number of multivalent vaccines that simultaneously protect against hepatitis b in addition to other diseases 
our hepatitis b immunotherapy  if developed  approved and commercialized  may compete directly with existing hepatitis b therapeutic products including antiviral drugs and interferon alpha manufactured by roche group  schering plough corporation  gilead sciences  inc  gsk and other companies 
tolamba if approved and commercialized  will compete directly with conventional allergy immunotherapy 
conventional allergy immunotherapy products are mixed by allergists and customized for individual patients from commercially available plant material extracts 
because conventional immunotherapies are customized on an individual patient basis  they are not marketed or sold as fda approved pharmaceutical products 
other companies such as alk abello schering plough corporation  allergy therapeutics plc  curalogic and cytos biotechnology are developing enhanced allergy immunotherapeutic products formulated for injection  oral and sublingual delivery 
a number of companies  including gsk  merck  and astrazeneca  produce pharmaceutical products  such as antihistamines  corticosteroids and anti leukotriene agents  which manage allergy symptoms 
we consider these pharmaceutical products to be indirect competition for tolamba because although they are targeting the same disease  they do not attempt to treat the underlying cause of the disease 
our tlr agonist therapy for cancer  if approved and commercialized  will compete directly with other immune therapies such as those in development by coley pfizer  inc and idera pharmaceuticals  inc 
in addition  our cancer therapy may compete directly or indirectly with cytotoxic therapies and biologics in development from other parties  including but not limited to amgen  bristol myers squibb  genentech  schering plough corporation  and pfizer  inc standards of care can evolve rapidly in oncology and our ability to develop our therapies to be compatible with evolving standards of care will be critical 
our iss asthma product candidate would indirectly compete with existing asthma therapies  including corticosteroids  leukotriene inhibitors and ige monoclonal antibodies  including those produced by novartis  astrazeneca  schering plough corporation and gsk 
we consider these existing therapies to be indirect competition because they only attempt to address the symptoms of the disease and  unlike our product candidate  do not attempt to address the underlying cause of the disease 
we are also aware of a preclinical inhaled product  which may target the underlying cause of asthma  rather than just the symptoms  which is being developed by sanofi aventis under a collaboration agreement with coley 
this product  if approved and commercialized  may compete directly with our asthma product candidate 
many of the entities developing and marketing these competing products have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development  manufacturing  preclinical testing  conducting clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing than us 
smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors  particularly for collaborative agreements with large  established companies and access to capital 
these entities may also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel  as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to  or necessary for  our programs 

table of contents regulatory considerations the advertising  labeling  storage  record keeping  safety  efficacy  research  development  testing  manufacture  promotion  marketing and distribution of our potential products are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the us and other countries 
in the us  pharmaceutical and biological products are subject to rigorous review by the fda under the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act  the public health service act and other federal statutes and regulations 
the steps ordinarily required by the fda before a new drug or biologic may be marketed in the us are similar to steps required in most other countries and include but are not limited to the following completion of preclinical laboratory tests  preclinical trials and formulation studies  submission to the fda of an investigational new drug application  or ind  for a new drug or biologic which must become effective before clinical trials may begin  performance of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug or biologic for each proposed indication  the submission of a new drug application  or nda  or a biologics license application  or bla  to the fda  and fda review and approval of the nda or bla before any commercial marketing  sale or shipment of the drug 
if we do not comply with applicable requirements  us regulatory authorities may fine us  require that we recall our products  seize our products  require that we totally or partially suspend the production of our products  refuse to approve our marketing applications  criminally prosecute us  and or revoke previously granted marketing authorizations 
to secure fda approval  we must submit extensive non clinical and clinical data  manufacturing information  and other supporting information to the fda for each indication to establish a product candidate s safety and efficacy 
the number of preclinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for fda and foreign regulatory agency approvals varies depending on the product candidate  the disease or condition for which the product candidate is in development and regulations applicable to any particular drug candidate 
data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval or clearance 
further  the results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of results obtained in later clinical trials 
the approval process takes many years  requires the expenditures of substantial resources  involves post marketing surveillance and may involve requirements for additional post marketing studies 
the fda may also require post marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products or place conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial applications of these products 
the fda may withdraw product approvals if we do not continue to comply with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing 
delays experienced during the governmental approval process may materially reduce the period during which we will have exclusive rights to exploit patented products or technologies 
delays can occur at any stage of drug development and as result of many factors  certain of which are not under our control  including but not limited to the following lack of efficacy  or incomplete or inconclusive results from clinical trials  unforeseen safety issues  failure by investigators to adhere to protocol requirements  including patient enrollment criteria  slower than expected rate of patient recruitment  failure by subjects to comply with trial protocol requirements  inability to follow patients adequately after treatment  
table of contents inability to qualify and enter into arrangements with third parties to manufacture sufficient quality and quantities of materials for use in clinical trials  failure by a contract research organization to fulfill contractual obligations  and adverse changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development or the period of review of any application for regulatory approval or clearance 
non clinical studies involve laboratory evaluation of product characteristics and animal studies to assess the initial efficacy and safety of the product 
the fda  under its good laboratory practices regulations  regulates non clinical studies 
violations of these regulations can  in some cases  lead to invalidation of those studies  requiring these studies to be replicated 
the results of the non clinical tests  together with manufacturing information and analytical data  are submitted to the fda as part of an investigational new drug application  which must be approved by the fda before we can commence clinical investigations in humans 
unless the fda objects to an investigational new drug application  the investigational new drug application will become effective days following its receipt by the fda 
clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to humans under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator 
we must conduct our clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice under protocols submitted to the fda as part of the investigational new drug application 
in addition  each clinical trial must be approved and conducted under the auspices of an investigational review board and with patient informed consent 
the investigational review board will consider  among other things  ethical factors  the safety of human subjects and the possibility of liability of the institution conducting the trial 
the stages of the fda regulatory process include research and preclinical studies and clinical trials in three sequential phases that may overlap 
research and preclinical studies do not involve the introduction of a product candidate in human subjects 
these activities involve identification of potential product candidates  modification of promising candidates to optimize their biological activity  as well as preclinical studies to assess safety and effectiveness in animals 
in clinical trials  the product candidate is administered to humans 
phase clinical trials typically involve the administration of a product candidate into a small group of healthy human subjects 
these trials are the first attempt to evaluate a drug s safety  determine a safe dose range and identify side effects 
during phase trials  the product candidate is introduced into patients who suffer from the medical condition that the product candidate is intended to treat 
phase studies are designed to evaluate whether a product candidate shows evidence of effectiveness  to further evaluate dosage  and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks 
when phase evaluations demonstrate that a product candidate appears to be both safe and effective  phase trials are undertaken to confirm a product candidate s effectiveness and to test for safety in an expanded patient population 
if the results of phase trials appear to confirm effectiveness and safety  the data gathered in all phases of clinical trials form the basis for an application for fda regulatory approval of the product candidate 
we and all of our contract manufacturers are required to comply with the applicable fda current good manufacturing practice gmp regulations 
manufacturers of biologics also must comply with fda s general biological product standards 
failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements subjects the manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action  such as suspension of manufacturing  seizure of product or voluntary recall of a product 
good manufacturing practice regulations require quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation 
prior to granting product approval  the fda must determine that our or our third party contractor s manufacturing facilities meet good manufacturing practice requirements before we can use them in the commercial manufacture of our products 
in addition  our facilities are subject to periodic inspections by the fda for continued compliance with good manufacturing practice requirements during clinical development as well as following product approval 
adverse experiences with the product must be reported to the fda and could result in the imposition of market restriction through labeling changes or in product removal 
outside the us  our ability to market a product is contingent upon receiving marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities 
the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials  marketing authorization  pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country 

table of contents at present  foreign marketing authorizations may be applied for at a national level  although within the european union registration procedures are mandatory for biotechnology and some other drugs and are available to companies wishing to market a product in more than one european union member state 
the regulatory authority generally will grant marketing authorization if it is satisfied that we have presented it with adequate evidence of safety  quality and efficacy 
we are also subject to various federal  state and local laws  regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions  laboratory and manufacturing practices  the experimental use of animals and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances  including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents  used in connection with our research 
we cannot accurately predict the extent of government regulation that might result from any future legislation or administrative action 
employees as of february   we had full time employees  including phds  phds and others with advanced degrees 
of the employees  were dedicated to research and development activities 
none of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement  and we believe our relations with our employees are good

risk factors 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements concerning our future products  product candidates  development plans  expenses  revenues  liquidity and cash needs  as well as our commercialization plans and strategies 
these forward looking statements are based on current expectations and we assume no obligation to update this information 
numerous factors could cause our actual results to differ significantly from the results described in these forward looking statements  including the following risk factors 
we have incurred substantial losses since inception and do not have any commercial products that generate significant revenue 
we have experienced significant operating losses in each year since our inception 
our accumulated deficit was million as of december  to date  our revenue has resulted from collaboration agreements  services and license fees from customers of dynavax europe  and government and private agency grants 
the grants are subject to annual review based on the achievement of milestones and other factors and will terminate in we anticipate that we will incur substantial additional operating losses for the foreseeable future as the result of our investment in research and development activities 
we do not have any products that generate significant revenue 
clinical trials for certain of our product candidates are ongoing 
these and our other product candidates may never be commercialized  and we may never achieve profitability 
our ability to generate revenue depends upon demonstrating in clinical trials that our product candidates are safe and effective  in particular  in the current and planned trials for our product candidates  obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates  and entering into and maintaining successful collaborative relationships 

table of contents if we are unable to generate significant revenues or achieve profitability  we may be required to reduce or discontinue our current and planned operations or raise additional capital on less favorable terms 
if we are unable to secure additional funding  we will have to reduce or discontinue operations 
we believe our existing capital resources will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
because of the significant time and resources it will take to develop and commercialize our product candidates  we will require substantial additional capital resources in order to continue our operations  and any such funding may not allow us to continue operations as currently planned 
we expect capital outlays and operating expenditures to increase over the next several years as we expand our operations  and any change in plans may increase these outlays and expenditures 
we may be unable to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms  or at all and we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate some or all of our programs  or discontinue our operations 
the success of our tlr product candidates depends on achieving regulatory approval 
failure to obtain regulatory approvals could require us to discontinue operations 
none of our tlr product candidates has been approved for sale 
any product candidate we develop is subject to extensive regulation by federal  state and local governmental authorities in the united states  including the fda  and by foreign regulatory agencies 
our success is primarily dependent on our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our most advanced tlr product candidates 
approval processes in the united states and in other countries are uncertain  take many years and require the expenditure of substantial resources 
we will need to demonstrate in clinical trials that a product candidate is safe and effective before we can obtain the necessary approvals from the fda and foreign regulatory agencies 
if we identify any safety issues associated with our product candidates  we may be restricted from initiating further trials for those products 
moreover  we may not see sufficient signs of efficacy in those studies 
the fda or foreign regulatory agencies may require us to conduct additional clinical trials prior to approval 
many new drug candidates  including many drug candidates that have completed phase clinical trials  have shown promising results in early clinical trials and subsequently failed to establish sufficient safety and efficacy to obtain regulatory approval 
despite the time and money expended  regulatory approvals are uncertain 
failure to successfully complete clinical trials and show that our products are safe and effective would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our clinical trials may be extended  suspended  delayed or terminated at any time 
even short delays in the commencement and progress of our trials may lead to substantial delays in the regulatory approval process for our product candidates  which will impair our ability to generate revenues 
we may extend  suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time for various reasons  including regulatory actions by the fda or foreign regulatory agencies  actions by institutional review boards  failure to comply with good clinical practice requirements  concerns regarding health risks to test subjects or inadequate supply of the product candidate 
in addition  our ability to conduct clinical trials for some of our product candidates is limited due to the seasonal nature 
even a small delay in a trial for any product candidate could require us to delay commencement of the trial until the target population is available for testing  which could result in a delay of an entire year 
for example  our decision to discontinue the dartt and pediatric studies of tolamba will have a significant impact on the timing and potential cost for potential approval of tolamba in the treatment of ragweed allergies if further development efforts are initiated 
our registration and commercial timelines depend on results of the current and planned clinical trials and further discussions with the fda 
any extension  suspension  termination or unanticipated delays of our clinical trials could adversely affect our ability to timely and successfully commercialize or market these product candidates  
table of contents result in significant additional costs  potentially diminish any competitive advantages for those products  adversely affect our ability to enter into collaborations  receive milestone payments or royalties from potential collaborators  cause us to abandon the development of the affected product candidate  or limit our ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we receive regulatory approval for our product candidates  we will be subject to ongoing fda and foreign regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review 
any regulatory approvals that we receive for our product candidates are likely to contain requirements for post marketing follow up studies  which may be costly 
product approvals  once granted  may be modified based on data from subsequent studies or long term use 
as a result  limitations on labeling indications or marketing claims  or withdrawal from the market may be required if problems occur after commercialization 
in addition  we or our contract manufacturers will be required to adhere to federal regulations setting forth current good manufacturing practice 
the regulations require that our product candidates be manufactured and our records maintained in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing  testing and quality control activities 
furthermore  we or our contract manufacturers must pass a pre approval inspection of manufacturing facilities by the fda and foreign regulatory agencies before obtaining marketing approval and will be subject to periodic inspection by the fda and corresponding foreign regulatory agencies under reciprocal agreements with the fda 
further  to the extent that we contract with third parties for the manufacture of our products  our ability to control third party compliance with fda requirements will be limited to contractual remedies and rights of inspection 
failure to comply with regulatory requirements could prevent or delay marketing approval or require the expenditure of money or other resources to correct 
failure to comply with applicable requirements may also result in warning letters  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal of the government to renew marketing applications and criminal prosecution  any of which could be harmful to our ability to generate revenues and our stock price 
our product candidates in clinical trials rely on a single lead iss compound  iss  and most of our earlier stage programs rely on iss based technology 
serious adverse safety data relating to either iss or other iss based technology may require us to reduce the scope of or discontinue our operations 
our product candidates in clinical trials are based on our iss compound  and substantially all of our research and development programs use iss based technology 
if any of our product candidates in clinical trials produce serious adverse safety data  we may be required to delay or discontinue all of our clinical trials 
in addition  as all of our clinical product candidates contain iss  a common safety risk across therapeutic areas may hinder our ability to enter into potential collaborations and if adverse safety data are found to apply to our iss based technology as a whole  we may be required to significantly reduce or discontinue our operations 
we rely on third parties and our facility in d sseldorf  germany to supply materials necessary to manufacture our clinical product candidates for our clinical trials 
loss of these suppliers or key employees in d sseldorf  or failure to timely replace them may delay our clinical trials and research and development efforts and may result in additional costs  which could preclude us from manufacturing our product candidates on commercially reasonable terms 
we rely on a number of third parties and our facility in d sseldorf for the multiple steps involved in the manufacturing process of our product candidates  including  for example  iss  a key component material that is necessary for our product candidates  the combination of the antigens and iss  and the fill and finish 

table of contents termination or interruption of these relationships may occur due to circumstances that are outside of our control  resulting in higher cost or delays in our product development efforts 
we and these third parties are required to comply with applicable fda current good manufacturing practice regulations and other international regulatory requirements 
if one of these parties fails to maintain compliance with these regulations  the production of our product candidates could be interrupted  resulting in delays and additional costs 
additionally  these third parties and our manufacturing facility must pass a pre approval inspection before we can obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates 
we have relied on a single supplier to produce our iss for clinical trials 
to date  we have manufactured only small quantities of iss ourselves for research purposes 
if we were unable to maintain or replace our existing source for iss  we would have to establish internal iss manufacturing capability which would result in increased capital and operating costs and delays in developing and commercializing our product candidates 
we or other third parties may not be able to produce iss at a cost  quantity and quality that are available from our current third party supplier 
we currently utilize our facility in d sseldorf to manufacture heplisav 
we may enter into manufacturing agreements with one or more commercial scale contract manufacturers to produce additional supplies of heplisav as required for new clinical trials and commercialization  or we may have to establish internal commercial scale manufacturing capability for heplisav  incurring increased capital and operating costs  delays in the commercial development of heplisav and higher manufacturing costs than we have experienced to date 
we rely on contract research organizations to conduct our clinical trials 
if these third parties do not fulfill their contractual obligations or meet expected deadlines  our planned clinical trials may be delayed and we may fail to obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to commercialize our product candidates 
we rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials 
if these third parties do not perform their obligations or meet expected deadlines our planned clinical trials may be extended  delayed or terminated 
any extension  delay or termination of our clinical trials would delay our ability to commercialize our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 
if any products we develop are not accepted by the market or if regulatory agencies limit our labeling indications or marketing claims  we may be unable to generate significant revenues  if any 
even if we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates and are able to successfully commercialize them  our products may not gain market acceptance among physicians  patients  health care payors and the medical community 
the fda or other regulatory agencies could limit the labeling indication for which our product candidates may be marketed or could otherwise limit marketing efforts for our products 
if we are unable to successfully market any approved product candidates  or marketing efforts are restricted by regulatory limits  our ability to generate revenues could be significantly impaired 
we intend to seek partners for purposes of commercialization of heplisav in selected markets worldwide 
marketing challenges vary by market and could limit or delay acceptance in any particular country 
we believe that market acceptance of heplisav will depend on our ability to offer increased efficacy and improved ease of use as compared to existing or potential new hepatitis b vaccine products 
a key part of our business strategy is to establish collaborative relationships to commercialize and fund development of our product candidates 
we may not succeed in establishing and maintaining collaborative relationships  which may significantly limit our ability to develop and commercialize our products successfully  if at all 
we will need to establish collaborative relationships to obtain domestic and international sales  marketing and distribution capabilities for our product candidates 
we also intend to enter into collaborative relationships to provide funding to support our research and development programs 
the process of establishing collaborative relationships is difficult  time consuming and involves significant uncertainty 
moreover  even if we do 
table of contents establish collaborative relationships  our collaborators may seek to renegotiate or terminate their relationships with us due to unsatisfactory clinical results  a change in business strategy  a change of control or other reasons 
if any collaborator fails to fulfill its responsibilities in a timely manner  or at all  our research  clinical development or commercialization efforts related to that collaboration could be delayed or terminated  or it may be necessary for us to assume responsibility for expenses or activities that would otherwise have been the responsibility of our collaborator 
if we are unable to establish and maintain collaborative relationships on acceptable terms  we may have to delay or discontinue further development of one or more of our product candidates  undertake development and commercialization activities at our own expense or find alternative sources of capital 
many of our competitors have greater financial resources and expertise than we do 
if we are unable to successfully compete with existing or potential competitors despite these disadvantages we may be unable to generate revenues and our business will be harmed 
we compete with pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies  academic institutions and research organizations  in developing therapies to treat or prevent infectious diseases  allergy  asthma and cancer  as well as those focusing more generally on the immune system 
competitors may develop more effective  more affordable or more convenient products or may achieve earlier patent protection or commercialization of their products 
these competitive products may render our product candidates obsolete or limit our ability to generate revenues from our product candidates 
many of the companies developing competing technologies and products have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development  manufacturing  preclinical and clinical testing  obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing than we do 
existing and potential competitors may also compete with us for qualified scientific and management personnel  as well as for technology that would be advantageous to our business 
if we are unable to compete successfully  we may not be able to obtain financing  enter into collaborative arrangements  sell our product candidates or generate revenues 
we depend on key employees in a competitive market for skilled personnel  and the loss of the services of any of our key employees would affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates and achieve our objectives 
we are highly dependent on the principal members of our management  operations and scientific staff  including our chief executive officer  dr 
dino dina 
we experience intense competition for qualified personnel 
our future success also depends in part on the continued service of our executive management team  key scientific and management personnel and our ability to recruit  train and retain essential scientific personnel for our drug discovery and development programs  including those who will be responsible for overseeing our preclinical testing and clinical trials as well as for the establishment of collaborations with other companies 
if we lose the services of any key personnel  our research and product development goals  including the identification and establishment of key collaborations  operations and marketing efforts could be delayed or curtailed 
we may develop  seek regulatory approval for and market our product candidates outside the united states  requiring a significant commitment of resources 
failure to successfully manage our international operations could result in significant unanticipated costs and delays in regulatory approval or commercialization of our product candidates 
we may introduce certain of our product candidates  notably heplisav  in various markets outside the united states 
developing  seeking regulatory approval for and marketing our product candidates outside the 
table of contents united states could impose substantial burdens on our resources and divert management s attention from domestic operations 
international operations are subject to risk  including the difficulty of managing geographically distant operations  including recruiting and retaining qualified employees  locating adequate facilities and establishing useful business support relationships in the local community  compliance with varying international regulatory requirements  laws and treaties  securing international distribution  marketing and sales capabilities  adequate protection of our intellectual property rights  legal uncertainties and potential timing delays associated with tariffs  export licenses and other trade barriers  adverse tax consequences  the fluctuation of conversion rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar  and geopolitical risks 
if we are unable to successfully manage our international operations  we may incur significant unanticipated costs and delays in regulatory approval or commercialization of our product candidates  which would impair our ability to generate revenues 
we recently acquired rhein biotech gmbh and any difficulties from integrating rhein s business into ours could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition 
in april  we acquired rhein biotech gmbh 
through this acquisition  we gained ownership of a european union eu gmp certified vaccine manufacturing facility in d sseldorf  germany  certain vaccine and other commercial programs  a management team and personnel with specialized expertise in process development and vaccine manufacturing 
integrating rhein s operations  technology and personnel with our operations and personnel is a complex process 
the successful integration of dynavax and rhein requires  among other things  ongoing coordination of various integration efforts  relating to our personnel system  technologies and commercial programs 
we may not be able to rapidly or efficiently integrate rhein s business and technology into ours and the expected benefits of the combination may not materialize 
our ability to successfully integrate rhein involves numerous risks  including difficulties in integrating the operations  technologies  products and personnel of rhein  including achieving compliance with the requirements under section of the sarbanes oxley act of by the end of  difficulties in successfully utilizing rhein s manufacturing capabilities to produce materials for our existing product candidates in lieu of purchasing such materials from third party vendors  diversion of management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  potential difficulties in integrating different projects  difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions  insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with the acquisition  and potential loss of key employees of rhein 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate rhein and its technology and personnel into our business 
we rely on our licenses from the regents of the university of california 
impairment of these licenses or our inability to maintain them would severely harm our business 
our current research and development efforts depend upon our license arrangements with the regents of the university of california  or uc 
our dependence on these licenses subjects us to numerous risks  such as disputes regarding the creation or use of intellectual property by us and uc  or scientific collaborators 

table of contents additionally  our agreements with uc generally contain diligence or milestone based termination provisions 
our failure to meet any obligations pursuant to these provisions could allow uc to terminate our agreements or convert exclusive to non exclusive licenses 
in addition  our license agreements with uc may be terminated or may expire by their terms  and we may not be able to maintain the exclusivity of these licenses 
if we cannot maintain licenses that are advantageous or necessary to the development or the commercialization of our product candidates  we may be required to expend significant time and resources to develop or license similar technology 
if third parties successfully assert that we have infringed their patents and proprietary rights or challenge the validity of our patents and proprietary rights  we may become involved in intellectual property disputes and litigation that would be costly  time consuming  and delay or prevent development or commercialization of our product candidates 
we may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on claims that our product candidates or proprietary technologies infringe their intellectual property rights  or we may be required to enter into litigation to enforce patents issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope or validity of our or another party s proprietary rights  including a challenge as to the validity of our issued and pending claims 
if we become involved in any litigation  interference or other administrative proceedings related to our intellectual property or the intellectual property of others  we will incur substantial additional expenses and it will divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
two of our potential competitors relative to heplisav  merck and gsk  are exclusive licensees of broad patents covering hepatitis b surface antigen 
in addition  the institute pasteur also owns or has exclusive licenses to patents covering hepatitis b surface antigen 
while some of these patents have expired or will soon expire outside of the united states  they remain in force in the united states and are likely to be in force when we commercialize heplisav or a similar product in the united states 
to the extent we are able to commercialize heplisav in the united states while these patents are issued  merck and or gsk or the institute pasteur may bring claims against us 
if we are unsuccessful in defending or prosecuting our issued and pending claims or in defending potential claims against us  for example  as may arise to the extent we were to commercialize heplisav or any similar product candidate in the united states  we could be required to pay substantial damages and we may be unable to commercialize our product candidates or use our proprietary technologies unless we obtain a license from these or other third parties if a license is available at all 
a license may require us to pay substantial fees or royalties  require us to grant a cross license to our technology or may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  we may be required to redesign our technology so it does not infringe a third party s patents  which may not be possible or could require substantial funds and time 
any of these outcomes could require us to change our business strategy and could materially impact our business and operations 
another of our potential competitors  coley  has issued us patent claims  as well as patent claims pending with the us patent and trademark office  or pto that may be asserted against our iss products 
we may need to obtain a license to one or more of these claims held by coley by paying fees or royalties or offering rights to our own proprietary technologies in order to commercialize one or more of our formulations of iss in the us such a license may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all  which could preclude or limit our ability to commercialize our products 
if the combination of patents  trade secrets and contractual provisions that we rely on to protect our intellectual property is inadequate  the value of our product candidates will decrease 
our success depends on our ability to obtain and protect commercially valuable patents or the rights to patents both domestically and abroad  operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others  and prevent others from successfully challenging or infringing our proprietary rights 

table of contents we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use only to the extent that these rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
we try to protect our proprietary rights by filing and prosecuting united states and foreign patent applications 
however  in certain cases such protection may be limited  depending in part on existing patents held by third parties  which may only allow us to obtain relatively narrow patent protection 
in the united states  legal standards relating to the validity and scope of patent claims in the biopharmaceutical field can be highly uncertain  are still evolving and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved 
the biopharmaceutical patent environment outside the united states is even more uncertain 
we may be particularly affected by this uncertainty since several of our product candidates may initially address market opportunities outside the united states 
for example  we expect to market heplisav  if approved  in various foreign countries with high incidences of hepatitis b  including canada  europe and selected markets in asia  where we may only be able to obtain limited patent protection 
the risks and uncertainties that we face with respect to our patents and other proprietary rights include the following we might not receive an issued patent for any of our patent applications or for any patent applications that we have exclusively licensed  the pending patent applications we have filed or to which we have exclusive rights may take longer than we expect to result in issued patents  the claims of any patents that are issued may not provide meaningful protection or may not be valid or enforceable  we might not be able to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable  the patents licensed or issued to us or our collaborators may not provide a competitive advantage  patents issued to other parties may limit our intellectual property protection or harm our ability to do business  other parties may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate our technologies and commercialize discoveries that we attempt to patent  and other parties may design around technologies we have licensed  patented or developed 
we also rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests in proprietary know how that is not patentable and for processes for which patents are difficult to enforce 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to protect our trade secrets adequately 
any disclosure of confidential data in the public domain or to third parties could allow our competitors to learn our trade secrets 
if we are unable to adequately obtain or enforce proprietary rights we may be unable to commercialize our products  enter into collaborations  generate revenues or maintain any advantage we may have with respect to existing or potential competitors 
we have licensed some of our development and commercialization rights to certain of our development programs in connection with our symphony dynamo funding arrangement and will not receive any future royalties or revenues with respect to this intellectual property unless we exercise an option to repurchase the programs in the future 
we may not obtain sufficient clinical data in order to determine whether we should exercise this option prior to the expiration of the development period  and even if we decide to exercise  we may not have the financial resources to exercise this option in a timely manner 
in  we granted an exclusive license to the intellectual property for certain iss compounds for cancer  hepatitis b and hepatitis c therapeutics to symphony dynamo  inc  or sdi  in consideration for a commitment from symphony capital partners  lp and its co investors to provide million of committed capital to advance these programs 
as part of the arrangement  we received an option granting us the exclusive right  but not the obligation  to acquire certain or all of the programs at specified points in time at specified prices during the term of the five year development period 
the development programs under the arrangement are jointly managed by sdi and us  and there can be no assurance that we will agree on various decisions that will enable us to successfully develop the potential products  or even if we are in agreement on the 
table of contents development plans  that the development efforts will result in sufficient clinical data to make a fully informed decision with respect to the exercise of our option 
if we do not exercise the purchase option prior to its expiration  then our rights in and with respect to the sdi programs will terminate and we will no longer have rights to any of the programs licensed to sdi under the arrangement 
if we elect to exercise the purchase option  we will be required to make a substantial payment  which at our election may be paid partially in shares of our common stock 
as a result  in order to exercise the option  we will be required to make a substantial payment of cash and possibly issue a substantial number of shares of our common stock 
we do not currently have the resources to exercise the option and we may be required to enter into a financing arrangement or license arrangement with one or more third parties  or some combination of these in order to exercise the option  even if we paid a portion of the purchase price with our common stock 
there can be no assurance that any financing or licensing arrangement will be available or even if available  that the terms would be favorable to us and our stockholders 
in addition  the exercise of the purchase option will likely require us to record a significant charge to earnings and may adversely impact future operating results 
we face product liability exposure  which  if not covered by insurance  could result in significant financial liability 
while we have not experienced any product liability claims to date  the use of any of our product candidates in clinical trials and the sale of any approved products will subject us to potential product liability claims and may raise questions about a product s safety and efficacy 
as a result  we could experience a delay in our ability to commercialize one or more of our product candidates or reduced sales of any approved product candidates 
in addition  a product liability claim may exceed the limits of our insurance policies and exhaust our internal resources 
we have obtained limited product liability insurance coverage in the amount of million for each occurrence for clinical trials with umbrella coverage of an additional million 
this coverage may not be adequate or may not continue to be available in sufficient amounts  at an acceptable cost or at all 
we also may not be able to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any product approved for marketing in the future 
a product liability claim  product recalls or other claims  as well as any claims for uninsured liabilities or in excess of insured liabilities  would divert our management s attention from our business and could result in significant financial liability 
we face uncertainty related to coverage  pricing and reimbursement and the practices of third party payors  which may make it difficult or impossible to sell our product candidates on commercially reasonable terms 
in both domestic and foreign markets  our ability to achieve profitability will depend in part on the negotiation of a favorable price or the availability of appropriate reimbursement from third party payors 
existing laws affecting the pricing and coverage of pharmaceuticals and other medical products by government programs and other third party payors may change before any of our product candidates are approved for marketing 
in addition  third party payors are increasingly challenging the price and cost effectiveness of medical products and services 
because we intend to offer products  if approved  that involve new technologies and new approaches to treating disease  the willingness of third party payors to reimburse for our products is particularly uncertain 
we will have to charge a price for our products that is sufficiently high to enable us to recover our considerable investment in product development 
adequate third party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to achieve profitability and could harm our future prospects and reduce our stock price 
we use hazardous materials in our business 
any claims or liabilities relating to improper handling  storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly to resolve 
our research and product development activities involve the controlled storage  use and disposal of hazardous and radioactive materials and biological waste 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these materials and certain waste products 
we are currently in compliance with all government permits that are required for the storage  use 
table of contents and disposal of these materials 
however  we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury to persons or property from these materials 
in the event of an accident related to hazardous materials  we could be held liable for damages  cleanup costs or penalized with fines  and this liability could exceed the limits of our insurance policies and exhaust our internal resources 
we may have to incur significant costs to comply with future environmental laws and regulations 
our stock price is subject to volatility  and your investment may suffer a decline in value 
the market prices for securities of biopharmaceutical companies have in the past been  and are likely to continue in the future to be  very volatile 
the market price of our common stock is subject to substantial volatility depending upon many factors  many of which are beyond our control  including progress or results of any of our clinical trials or regulatory efforts  in particular any announcements regarding the progress or results of our planned trials  our ability to establish collaborations for the development and commercialization of our product candidates  our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations  technological innovations  new commercial products or drug discovery efforts and preclinical and clinical activities by us or our competitors  changes in our intellectual property portfolio or developments or disputes concerning the proprietary rights of our products or product candidates  our ability to obtain component materials and successfully enter into manufacturing relationships for our product candidates or establish manufacturing capacity on our own  our ability to enter into collaborations  maintenance of our existing exclusive licensing agreements with the regents of the university of california  changes in government regulations  general economic conditions  industry announcements  issuance of new or changed securities analysts reports or recommendations  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial and operating results  and volume of trading in our common stock one or more of these factors could cause a decline in the price of our common stock 
in addition  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities 
this risk is especially relevant for us because we have experienced greater than average stock price volatility  as have other biotechnology companies in recent years 
we may in the future be the target of similar litigation 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs  and divert management s attention and resources  which could harm our business  operating results and financial conditions 
anti takeover provisions of our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law may prevent or frustrate a change in control  even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders  which could affect our stock price adversely and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may delay or prevent a change in control  discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common stock and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting or other rights of the holders of our common stock 
these provisions include authorizing our board of directors to issue additional preferred stock with voting rights to be determined by the board of directors  
table of contents limiting the persons who can call special meetings of stockholders  prohibiting stockholder actions by written consent  creating a classified board of directors pursuant to which our directors are elected for staggered three year terms  providing that a supermajority vote of our stockholders is required for amendment to certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  and establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
in addition  we are subject to the provisions of the delaware corporation law that  in general  prohibit any business combination with a beneficial owner of or more of our common stock for five years unless the holder s acquisition of our stock was approved in advance by our board of directors 
we will continue to implement additional financial and accounting systems  procedures or controls as we grow our business and organization and to satisfy new reporting requirements 
we are required to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of and the related rules and regulations of the sec  including expanded disclosures and accelerated reporting requirements and more complex accounting rules 
compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  or section  and other requirements may increase our costs and require additional management resources 
we may need to continue to implement additional finance and accounting systems  procedures and controls as we grow our business and organization and to comply with new reporting requirements 
specifically  with the rhein acquisition  our foreign operations will be part of our operations for section compliance 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain a favorable assessment as to the adequacy of our internal control reporting 
if we are unable to maintain an unqualified attestation as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting  investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial reporting which could harm our business and could impact the price of our common stock
