in fiscal  increased sales resulted in an increase in payroll expenses 
in fiscal and  the increase of the minimum wage in new york and washington  dc resulted in an increase in payroll expenses 
we continually evaluate our payroll expenses as they relate to sales 
we typically incur significant pre opening expenses in connection with our new restaurants that are expensed as incurred 
furthermore  it is not uncommon that such restaurants experience operating losses during the early months of operation 
in fiscal  we converted our bar  luna lounge  at the resorts atlantic city hotel and casino in atlantic city  new jersey  into a restaurant  gallagher s burger bar  expanded our operations at the foxwoods resort casino by opening the grill at two trees in the two trees inn  a facility owned by the mashantucket pequot tribal nation and a part of the foxwoods resort casino  in ledyard  connecticut  began construction of a mexican restaurant and lounge  yolos  at the rethemed planet hollywood casino in las vegas  nevada  and began operating the durgin park restaurant and the black horse tavern in boston  massachusetts

we experienced  in pre opening and early operating losses at our yolos facility in fiscal also during fiscal  we entered into an agreement to design and lease a food court at the to be constructed mgm grand casino at the foxwoods resort casino 
the obligation to pay rent for this facility is not effective until the food court opens for business 
we anticipate the food court will open during our third quarter of the fiscal year 
all pre opening expenses will be borne by outside investors who will invest in a limited liability company established to develop  construct  operate and manage the food court 
we will be the managing member of this limited liability company and  through this limited liability company  we will lease and manage the operations of the food court in exchange for a monthly management fee equal to five percent of the gross receipts of the food court 
neither we nor any of our subsidiaries will contribute any capital to this limited liability company 
none of the obligations of this limited liability company will be guaranteed by us and investors in this limited liability company will have no recourse against us or any of our assets 
in fiscal  we established operations in atlantic city  new jersey by opening a bar  luna lounge  and a separate restaurant  a gallagher s steakhouse  in the resorts atlantic city hotel and casino 
we experienced  in pre opening and early operating losses at these facilities in fiscal further during fiscal  we established operations at the foxwoods resort casino in ledyard  connecticut by opening a restaurant  the fifth street cafe  in its newly expanded poker room in march and a fast casual restaurant  lucky seven  in the bingo hall in may all pre opening expenses were borne by outside investors who invested in a limited liability company established to develop  construct  operate and manage these facilities 
we did not open any new restaurants and no pre opening expenses and early operating losses were incurred during fiscal general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of total revenue  were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal during the fiscal year ended september   we managed one consolidated restaurant we did not own el rio grande and also managed our tampa and hollywood florida food court operations and our foxwoods operations 
we managed two restaurants we did not own the saloon and el rio grande and also managed our tampa and hollywood florida food court operations and our foxwoods operations at september  we managed two restaurants we did not own the saloon and el rio grande and also managed the tampa and hollywood florida food court operations at october  due to adoption of new accounting pronouncements   in sales of el rio grande were included in consolidated sales for fiscal sales of el rio grande  which are not included in consolidated sales during fiscal and  were  and  respectively 
our lease of the saloon was converted into a management agreement effective as of august   whereby we received a management fee of  per month regardless of the results of operations of this restaurant 
this restaurant closed effective july  during fiscal  we entered into agreements to manage fast food restaurants located in the hard rock casinos in hollywood and tampa  florida 
sales from these operations totaled  during the fiscal year   during the fiscal year and  during the fiscal year

interest expense was  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal interest income was  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal during fiscal we began an investment program utilizing our large cash balances 
investments are made in government securities and investment quality corporate instruments 
other income  which generally consists of purchasing service fees and other income at various restaurants  was   and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
income taxes the provision for income taxes reflects federal income taxes calculated on a consolidated basis and state and local income taxes calculated by each new york subsidiary on a non consolidated basis 
most of the restaurants we own or manage are owned or managed by a separate subsidiary 
for state and local income tax purposes  the losses incurred by a subsidiary may only be used to offset that subsidiary s income  with the exception of the restaurants operating in the district of columbia 
accordingly  our overall effective tax rate has varied depending on the level of losses incurred at individual subsidiaries 
our overall effective tax rate in the future will be affected by factors such as the level of losses incurred at our new york facilities  which cannot be consolidated for state and local tax purposes  pre tax income earned outside of new york city and the utilization of state and local net operating loss carry forwards 
nevada has no state income tax and other states in which we operate have income tax rates substantially lower in comparison to new york 
in order to utilize more effectively tax loss carry forwards at restaurants that were unprofitable  we have merged certain profitable subsidiaries with certain loss subsidiaries 
the revenue reconciliation act of provides tax credits to us for fica taxes paid on tip income of restaurant service personnel 
the net benefit to us was  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal during fiscal  we and the internal revenue service finalized the adjustments to our federal income tax returns for fiscal years through this settlement did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
our tax return for the fiscal year ended september  is currently under audit by the internal revenue service 
our tax returns for the fiscal years ended september  and october  are currently under audit by new york state 
we expect no material adjustments will result from these examinations 
liquidity and capital resources our primary source of capital has been cash provided by operations and funds available from our main bank  bank leumi usa 
we have  from time to time  also utilized equipment financing in connection with the construction of a restaurant and seller financing in connection with the acquisition of a restaurant 
we utilize capital primarily to fund the cost of developing and opening new restaurants  acquiring existing restaurants owned by others and remodeling existing restaurants we own 
the net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal was  cash was used for the replacement of fixed assets at existing restaurants  converting our bar  luna lounge  at the resorts atlantic city hotel and casino in atlantic city  new jersey  into a restaurant  gallagher s burger bar  opening the grill at two trees in the two trees inn  a facility owned by the mashantucket pequot tribal nation and a part of the foxwoods resort casino  in ledyard  connecticut  purchasing the durgin park restaurant and the black horse tavern in boston  massachusetts from the previous owner for  in cash and a  five year promissory note bearing interest at a rate of per year  and the construction of yolos  a mexican restaurant  at the planet hollywood resort and casino formerly known as the aladdin resort and casino in las vegas  nevada

a quarterly cash dividend in the amount of per share was declared on october  subsequent to october   quarterly cash dividends in the amount of per share were declared on january  april  july  october  december  and april  we declared an increase in our quarterly cash dividend to per share on may  and a subsequent quarterly cash dividend reflecting this increased amount was declared on october  in addition  we declared a special cash dividend in the amount of per share on december  prior to this  we had not paid any cash dividends since our inception 
we intend to continue to pay such quarterly cash dividend for the foreseeable future  however  the payment of future dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and is based on future earnings  cash flow  financial condition  capital requirements  changes in us taxation and other relevant factors

none of the obligations of this limited liability company will be guaranteed by us and investors in this limited liability company will have no recourse against us or any of our assets 
the opening of a new restaurant is invariably accompanied by substantial pre opening expenses and early operating losses associated with the training of personnel  excess kitchen costs  costs of supervision and other expenses during the pre opening period and during a post opening shake out period until operations can be considered to be functioning normally 
the amount of such pre opening expenses and early operating losses can generally be expected to depend upon the size and complexity of the facility being opened 
we incurred  in pre opening expenses in fiscal our restaurants generally do not achieve substantial increases in revenue from year to year  which we consider to be typical of the restaurant industry 
to achieve significant increases in revenue or to replace revenue of restaurants that lose customer favor or which close because of lease expirations or other reasons  we would have to open additional restaurant facilities or expand existing restaurants 
there can be no assurance that a restaurant will be successful after it is opened  particularly since in many instances we do not operate our new restaurants under a trade name currently used by us  thereby requiring new restaurants to establish their own identity 
apart from these agreements  we are not currently committed to any projects 
we may take advantage of opportunities we consider to be favorable  when they occur  depending upon the availability of financing and other factors 
recent restaurant dispositions and charges we entered into a sale and leaseback agreement with ge capital in november to refinance the purchase of various restaurant equipment at our food and beverage facilities at desert passage  the retail complex at the aladdin resort casino in las vegas  nevada 
in  the operations at the aladdin were abandoned 
the lease matured in november and  in connection therewith  we made an unprovided for lump sum payment of  due under this lease 
this lump sum payment was included in discontinued operations for the first quarter of fiscal our bar nightclub facility venus  located at the venetian casino resort  experienced a steady decline in sales and we felt that a new concept was needed at this location 
during the first quarter of  this bar nightclub facility was closed for re concepting and re opened as vivid on february  total conversion costs were approximately  sales at the new bar nightclub facility subsequently failed to reach a level sufficient to achieve the results we required and we have identified a buyer for this facility 
as of december   we classified the assets and liabilities of this bar nightclub facility as held for sale in accordance with sfas no 
based on the fact that the facility has met the criteria under sfas no 
based on the offers made for this facility  we recorded an impairment charge of  during the first fiscal quarter of an additional impairment charge of  was recorded during the fourth fiscal quarter of as a result of the sale of the facility 
we recorded operating losses of  and  respectively  during the fiscal years ended september  and september  the impairment charges and operating losses are included in discontinued operations 
effective august   our lease for the saloon at the neonopolis center at fremont street was converted into a management agreement whereby we received a management fee of  per month regardless of the results of operations of this restaurant 
in june  the owner of the neonopolis center at fremont street sold the building to a new entity who  on june   exercised its option to terminate the management agreement upon thirty days written notice to us 
on july   the landlord for the vico s burrito s fast food facility at the venetian casino resort  general growth properties  notified us that the landlord was exercising an option granted to it pursuant to the lease for the facility to terminate the lease in exchange for the landlord providing us with the unamortized portion of the non removable improvements located in the facility 
on august   we and our landlord for this facility entered into a letter agreement pursuant to which the landlord agreed to pay us  for the unamortized portion of the non removable improvements located in the facility 
during fiscal  the landlord for our metropolitan caf and one of our columbus bakery facilities notified us that he was planning on demolishing the building where these facilities are located and  therefore  would not be renewing these leases at the end of their term 
the leases at these facilities terminated on october  also during fiscal  we were approached by the venetian casino resort who indicated that  due to the expansion of the grand canal shoppes  our lutece and tsunami locations  as well as a portion of our vivid location  in the grand canal shoppes were desired by other tenants 
the venetian casino resort offered to purchase these locations from us for an aggregate of  after evaluating the offer  we determined that such offer made it advantageous for us to redeploy these assets 
effective december   our subsidiaries that leased each of our lutece  tsunami and vivid locations at the venetian resort hotel casino in las vegas  nevada  entered into an agreement to sell lutece  tsunami and a portion of the vivid location used by lutece as a prep kitchen to venetian casino resort  llc for an aggregate of  our lutece location closed on december  and our tsunami location closed on january  we realized a gain of   after taxes  or per share on the sale of these facilities 
we recorded operating income of  for the fiscal year ended september  the gain on sale and income are included in discontinued operations 
as a result of the above mentioned sales or closures  we allocated  and  of goodwill to these restaurants and reduced goodwill by these amounts in fiscal and  respectively 
critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
 published by the sec  recommends that all companies include a discussion of critical accounting policies used in the preparation of their financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
while all these significant accounting policies impact our financial condition and results of operations  we view certain of these policies as critical 
policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and estimates 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
we believe that given current facts and circumstances  it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would cause a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows for the periods presented in this report 
below are listed certain policies that management believes are critical use of estimates the preparation of financial statements requires the application of certain accounting policies  which may require us to make estimates and assumptions of future events 
in the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements  we estimate the appropriate carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  which are not readily apparent from other sources 
the primary estimates underlying our financial statements include allowances for potential bad debts on accounts and notes receivable  the useful lives and recoverability of its assets  such as property and intangibles  fair values of financial instruments and share based compensation  the realizable value of its tax assets and other matters 
management bases its estimates on certain assumptions  which they believe are reasonable in the circumstances and actual results could differ from those estimates 
long lived assets we annually assess any impairment in value of long lived assets to be held and used 
we evaluate the possibility of impairment by comparing anticipated undiscounted cash flows to the carrying amount of the related long lived assets 
if such cash flows are less than carrying value we then reduce the asset to its fair value 
fair value is generally calculated using discounted cash flows 
various factors such as sales growth and operating margins and proceeds from a sale are part of this analysis 
future results could differ from our projections with a resulting adjustment to income in such period 
leases we are obligated under various lease agreements for certain restaurants 
we recognize rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term  including option periods as described below 
within the provisions of certain leases there are escalations in payments over the base lease term  as well as renewal periods 
the effects of the escalations have been reflected in rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term  which includes option periods when it is deemed to be reasonably assured that we would incur an economic penalty for not exercising the option 
percentage rent expense is generally based upon sales levels and is expensed as incurred 
certain leases include both base rent and percentage rent 
we record rent expense on these leases based upon reasonably assured sales levels 
the consolidated financial statements reflect the same lease terms for amortizing leasehold improvements as were used in calculating straight line rent expense for each restaurant 
our judgments may produce materially different amounts of amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different lease terms were used 
deferred income tax valuation allowance we provide such allowance due to uncertainty that some of the deferred tax amounts may not be realized 
certain items  such as state and local tax loss carry forwards  are dependent on future earnings or the availability of tax strategies 
future results could require an increase or decrease in the valuation allowance and a resulting adjustment to income in such period 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets during  the fasb issued fas  which requires that for us  effective september   goodwill  including the goodwill included in the carrying value of investments accounted for using the equity method of accounting  and certain other intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite useful life  cease amortizing 
fas requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets be assessed for impairment using fair value measurement techniques 
specifically  goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit the company is being treated as one reporting unit with its net book value or carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the impairment test for other intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
determining the fair value of the reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including unrecognized intangible assets under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
similarly  estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of other intangible assets 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
to assist in the process of determining goodwill impairment  we obtain appraisals from independent valuation firms 
in addition to the use of independent valuation firms  we perform internal valuation analyses and consider other market information that is publicly available 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and market comparisons and recent transactions 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows including timing  discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  perpetual growth rate  determination of appropriate market comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables 
based on the above policy no impairment charges were recorded during the fiscal years ended  and share based compensation effective october  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r  and related interpretations and began expensing the grant date fair value of employee stock options 
prior to october   the company applied accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for its stock option plans 
accordingly  prior to october   no compensation expense has been recognized in net income for employee stock options  as options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
upon adoption of sfas r  the company elected to value employee stock options using the black scholes option valuation method that uses assumptions that relate to the expected volatility of the company s common stock  the expected dividend yield of our stock  the expected life of the options and the risk free interest rate 
the assumptions used for the options granted on december   which were unvested at the time of the adoption of sfas r  included a risk free interest rate of  volatility of  a dividend yield of and an expected life of three years 
the company adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method and therefore has not restated prior periods 
under this transition method  compensation cost associated with employee stock options recognized during fiscal includes amortization related to the remaining unvested portion of stock awards granted prior to october    options were granted during fiscal no options were granted during fiscal year recently issued accounting standards the financial accounting standards board fasb has recently issued the following accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no
