operating segment overview starbucks has three reportable operating segments united states  international and cpg 
the united states and international segments both include company operated retail stores  licensed retail stores and foodservice operations 
the united states segment has been operating significantly longer than the international segment and has developed deeper awareness of  and attachment to  the starbucks brand and stores among its customer base 
as a result  the united states segment has significantly more stores  and higher total revenues than the international segment 
average sales per store are also higher in the united states due to various factors including length of time in market and local income levels 
further  certain market costs  particularly occupancy costs  are lower in the united states segment compared to the average for the international segment  which comprises a more diverse group of operations 
as a result of the relative strength of the brand in the united states segment  the number of stores  the higher unit volumes  and the lower market costs  the united states segment has a higher operating margin than the less developed international segment 
the company s international store base continues to increase rapidly and starbucks is achieving a growing contribution from established international markets while at the same time investing in emerging markets  such as china  brazil and russia 
the company s newer international markets require a more extensive support organization  relative to the current levels of revenue and operating income 
the cpg segment includes the company s grocery and warehouse club business as well as branded products operations worldwide 
the cpg segment operates primarily through joint ventures and licensing arrangements with large consumer products business partners  most significantly the north american coffee partnership with the pepsi cola company for distribution of ready to drink beverages  and with kraft foods inc for distribution of packaged coffees and teas 
this operating model allows the cpg segment to leverage the business partners existing infrastructures and to extend the starbucks brand in an efficient way 
most of the customer revenues from the ready to drink and packaged coffee channels are recognized as revenues by the joint venture or licensed business partner  not by the cpg segment  and the proportionate share of the results of the company s joint ventures are included on a net basis in income from equity investees on the consolidated statements of earnings 
as a result  the cpg segment reflects relatively lower revenues  a modest cost structure  and a resulting higher operating margin  compared to the company s other two reporting segments  which consist primarily of retail stores 
expenses pertaining to corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments 
these unallocated corporate expenses include certain general and administrative expenses  related depreciation and amortization expenses and amounts included in net interest and other income on the consolidated statements of earnings

the umbrella risk management policy governs the 
table of contents hedging instruments the business may use and limits the dollar risk to net earnings 
the company also monitors and limits the amount of associated counterparty credit risk 
additionally  this policy restricts  among other things  the amount of market based risk the company will tolerate before implementing approved hedging strategies and prohibits speculative trading activity 
in general  hedge instruments do not have maturities in excess of five years 
the sensitivity analyses performed below provide only a limited  point in time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed 
the actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses 
commodity price risk the company purchases commodity inputs  including coffee and dairy products that are used in its operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact its financial results 
in addition to fixed priced contracts and price to be fixed contracts for coffee purchases  the company may enter into commodity hedges to manage commodity price risk using financial derivative instruments 
the company performed a sensitivity analysis based on a change in the underlying commodity prices of its commodity hedges  as of the end of fiscal  and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments 
foreign currency exchange risk the majority of the company s revenue  expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  because a portion of the company s operations consists of activities outside of the united states  the company has transactions in other currencies  primarily the canadian dollar  british pound sterling  euro  and japanese yen 
as a result  starbucks may engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments to hedge revenues  inventory purchases  assets  and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
as of september   the company had forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges under statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted  to hedge portions of anticipated international revenue streams and inventory purchases 
in addition  starbucks had forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify as accounting hedges of its net investment in starbucks japan  as well as the company s net investments in its canadian  uk  and chinese subsidiaries  to minimize foreign currency exposure 
these contracts expire within months 
the company also had forward foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes free standing derivatives  but which largely offset the financial impact of translating certain foreign currency denominated payables and receivables 
increases or decreases in the fair value of these hedges are generally offset by corresponding decreases or increases in the us dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated payables and receivables ie hedged items that would occur within the hedging period 
the following table summarizes the potential impact to the company s future net earnings and other comprehensive income oci from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due in turn to a change in the value of the us dollar as compared to the level of foreign exchange rates

the trading securities approximate a portion of the company s liability under the mdcp 
a corresponding liability is included in accrued compensation and related costs on the consolidated balance sheets 
these investments are 
table of contents recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in net interest and other income in the consolidated statements of earnings 
the offsetting changes in the mdcp liability are recorded in general and administrative expenses 
the company performed a sensitivity analysis based on a change in the underlying equity prices of its investments  as of the end of fiscal  and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments 
interest rate risk the company utilizes short and long term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage the effect of interest rate changes on its existing debt as well as the anticipated issuance of new debt 
at the end of fiscal years and  the company did not have any interest rate hedge agreements outstanding 
during the fiscal fourth quarter of  the company had treasury interest rate contracts in place to mitigate a portion of the interest rate risk associated with the million senior notes issued in august these contracts were dedesignated and settled at closing of the debt offering 
the following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates on the fair value of the company s debt in millions september  change in fair value basis point increase in basis point decrease in fair value underlying rate underlying rate debt the company s available for sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of fixed income instruments 
the primary objectives of these investments are to preserve capital and liquidity 
available for sale securities are investment grade and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the company does not hedge the interest rate exposure on its available for sale securities 
the company performed a sensitivity analysis based on a basis point change in the underlying interest rate of its available for sale securities  as of the end of fiscal  and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments 
seasonality and quarterly results the company s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations  including fluctuations resulting from the holiday season 
the company s cash flows from operations are considerably higher in the fiscal first quarter than the remainder of the year 
this is largely driven by cash received as starbucks cards are purchased and loaded during the holiday season 
since revenues from the starbucks card are recognized upon redemption and not when purchased  seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings are much less pronounced 
quarterly results are affected by the timing of the opening of new stores  and the company s growth may conceal the impact of other seasonal influences 
for these reasons  results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 
application of critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
starbucks considers its policies on impairment of long lived assets  stock based compensation  operating leases  self insurance reserves and income taxes to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing its consolidated financial statements 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long lived assets may be impaired  an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying values of the assets to projected future cash flows  in addition to other quantitative and qualitative analyses 
for goodwill and other intangible assets  impairment tests are performed annually and more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate goodwill carrying values exceed estimated reporting unit fair values and if indefinite useful lives are no longer appropriate for the company s trademarks 
upon indication that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable  the company recognizes an impairment loss as a charge against current operations 
property  plant and equipment assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows when assessing impairment 
cash flows for retail assets are identified at the individual store level 
long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value  less estimated costs to sell 
judgments made by the company related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and the ability of the company to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets  changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 
as the company assesses the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of its long lived assets  these factors could cause the company to realize material impairment charges 
stock based compensation starbucks accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment 
the company uses the black scholes merton option pricing model which requires the input of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated volatility of the company s common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures 
changes in the subjective assumptions could materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation  however based on an analysis using changes in certain assumptions that could be reasonably possible in the near term  management believes the effect on the expense recognized for fiscal would not have been material 
operating leases starbucks leases retail stores  roasting and distribution facilities and office space under operating leases 
the company provides for an estimate of asset retirement obligation aro expense at the lease inception date for operating leases with requirements to remove leasehold improvements at the end of the lease term 
estimating aros involves subjective assumptions regarding both the amount and timing of actual future retirement costs 
future actual costs could differ significantly from amounts initially estimated 
in addition  the large number of operating leases and the significant number of international markets in which the company has operating leases adds administrative complexity to the calculation of aro expense  as well as to the other technical accounting requirements of operating leases such as contingent rent 
self insurance reserves the company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms  including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool  to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation  healthcare benefits  general liability  property insurance  director and officers liability insurance and vehicle liability 
liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the company are not discounted and are estimated  in part  by considering historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
income taxes starbucks accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement 
table of contents carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals  deferred tax assets and liabilities 
these include establishing a valuation allowance related to the realizability of certain deferred tax assets  and contingent tax liabilities provided for the possibility of unfavorable outcomes in certain tax positions 
although the company believes that its estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with the accounting and reporting for uncertainty in income tax positions 
this interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and the company will adopt the new requirements in its first fiscal quarter of the cumulative effect of adopting fin will be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption 
the company expects that the effect of adopting fin will result in an immaterial adjustment to fiscal year opening retained earnings 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
early adoption is permitted 
starbucks must adopt these new requirements no later than its first fiscal quarter of starbucks has not yet determined the effect on the company s consolidated financial statements  if any  upon adoption of sfas  or if it will adopt the requirements prior to the first fiscal quarter of in september  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
the intent of sab is to reduce diversity in practice for the method companies use to quantify financial statement misstatements  including the effect of prior year uncorrected errors 
sab establishes an approach that requires quantification of financial statement errors using both an income statement and cumulative balance sheet approach 
sab was effective for annual financial statements for fiscal years ending after november   and the company adopted the new requirements in fiscal with no impact to its consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   or starbucks first fiscal quarter of early adoption is permitted 
starbucks has not yet determined if it will elect to apply any of the provisions of sfas or what the effect of adoption of the statement would have  if any  on its consolidated financial statements
