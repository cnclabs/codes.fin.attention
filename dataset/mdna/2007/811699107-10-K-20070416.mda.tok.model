item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis together with our consolidated financial statements  related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion and other parts of this annual report contain forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by such forward looking information due to competitive factors and other factors discussed at item a 
risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a leading developer  manufacturer and marketer of digital video systems and services including the management  aggregation  licensing  storage  and distribution of video  television  gaming and advertisement content to cable system operators  telecommunications companies and broadcast television companies 
we have three reportable segments broadband  broadcast and services 
the broadband segment includes hardware  software and systems  such as our digital advertising and video on demand products that digitally manage  store and distribute digital video for cable system operators and telecommunications companies 
the broadcast segment includes products for the storage  archival  on air playback of advertising and other video programming for the broadcast television industry 
our hardware  software and systems product revenues are comprised of sales originating from our broadband and broadcast segments 
the services segment is comprised of revenue related to professional services  media content services  installation  training  project management  product maintenance and technical support for the above products 
we have experienced fluctuations in our product revenues from quarter to quarter due to the timing of the receipt of customer orders and the shipment of those orders 
the factors that impact the timing of the receipt of customer orders include among other factors the customer s receipt of authorized signatures on their purchase orders  the budgetary approvals within the customer s company for capital purchases  and the ability to process the purchase order within the customer s organization in a timely manner 
factors that may impact the shipment of customer orders include the availability of material and labor to produce the product  the time required to produce and test the product before delivery  and the customer s required delivery date 
the delay in the timing of receipt and shipment of any one customer order can result in significant fluctuations in our revenue reported on a quarterly basis 
our operating results are significantly influenced by a number of factors  including the mix of products sold and services provided  pricing  costs of materials used in our products and the expansion of our operations during the fiscal year 
we price our products and services based upon our costs and consideration of the prices of competitive products and services in the marketplace 
the costs of our products primarily consist of the costs of components and subassemblies that have generally declined from product introduction to product maturity 
as a result of the growth of our business  our operating expenses have historically increased in the areas of research and development  selling and marketing  customer service and support and administration 
in the current state of the economy  we currently expect that our broadband and broadcast customers may still have limited capital spending budgets as we believe they are dependent on advertising revenues to fund their capital equipment purchases 
accordingly  we expect our financial results to vary from quarter to quarter  and our historical financial results are not necessarily indicative of future performance 
in light of the higher proportion of our international business due  in part  to our acquisitions of the european based businesses from liberate technologies and odg in fiscal  we expect movements in foreign currency exchange rates to have a greater impact on our operating results and the equity section of our balance sheet in the future 
our ability to continue to generate revenues within the markets that our products are sold and to generate cash from operations and net income is dependent on several factors which include market acceptance of the products and services offered by our customers and increased subscriber usage and demand for these products and services  selection by our customers of our products and services versus the products and services being offered by our competitors  our ability to introduce new products to the market in a timely manner and to meet the demands of the market for new products and product enhancements  our ability to maintain gross margins from the sale of our products and services at a level that will provide us with cash to fund our operations given the pricing pressures within the market and the costs of materials and labor to manufacture our products  and our ability to control operating costs given the fluctuations that we have experienced with revenues from quarter to quarter 
effective february   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
in accordance with that transition method  we have not restated prior periods for the effect of compensation expense calculated under sfas r 
we have continued to use the black scholes pricing model as the most appropriate method for determining the estimated fair value of all applicable awards 
compensation expense for all share based equity awards is being recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award 
during fiscal  total share based compensation was million  compared to  in fiscal which only included share based compensation for restricted stock awards 
on january   the company accelerated the vesting of certain unvested stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than per share that were previously awarded to its employees  including its executive officers and non employee directors  under the company s equity compensation plans 
this decision was the principal reason for the lower stock based compensation expense recorded in fiscal compared to the pro forma expense of million and million for the years ended january  and  respectively 
as of january   the unrecognized stock based compensation related to the unvested stock options was million net of estimated forfeitures 
total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for any future changes in estimated changes in forfeitures 
this cost will be recognized over an estimated weighted average amortization period of years 
in fiscal  our total revenues increased to million compared to a decrease in fiscal over fiscal the increase in revenues is attributable to a increase in product revenues to million in fiscal as compared to a decrease in fiscal over fiscal and a increase in service revenues to million in fiscal as compared to a increase in fiscal over fiscal the product revenue increase in fiscal was primarily attributable to higher revenues from video on demand  with total sales of million recorded in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the product revenue increase in fiscal was primarily attributable to a million increase in our video on demand software development revenues in the broadband segment associated with the comcast agreement executed in july and a full year of revenues from the middleware software contracts acquired from liberate technologies in july in addition  video on demand systems revenues increased by million reflecting an increase in demand by north american cable system operators 
our advertising product revenues within the broadband segment decreased by to million in fiscal compared to an increase of in fiscal over fiscal the decrease in advertising product revenues is due to decreased order activity for customer replacement of analog advertising insertion systems with digital systems 
we expect video on demand product revenues will increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal based upon our customers continued expansion of these systems and software in key regional domestic markets  the success of certain telephony companies in entering the video on demand market  and the continued deployment of video on demand systems and software to new customers in asia  europe and south america during fiscal our broadcast product revenues increased by to million in fiscal compared to a decrease of in fiscal over fiscal we expect sales of broadcast products to increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal based on the expected introduction of enhancements to our existing broadcast products 
services revenues increased million or in fiscal compared with a increase in fiscal over fiscal primarily due to a full year of odg s media content services  or million  recognized in fiscal in comparison to only four months  or million  recognized in fiscal from the date of seachange s acquisition of odg in september in addition  million of the increase is attributable to the increase in video on demand product maintenance contracts and other technical support services from a growing installed base of vod systems 
we expect services revenues will increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal  due to an anticipated increase in the installed base of our video on demand systems and increased revenue at odg tied to the expansion of its business beyond the uk 
gross profit increased percentage points to in fiscal from in fiscal in comparison to a four percentage point increase in fiscal over fiscal increased total revenues and increased revenues from higher margin software development contracts each contributed to the increase in gross profit 
our services gross profit was in fiscal compared to in fiscal we believe that competitive pressures will continue and our ability to maintain or improve gross margin will be dependent upon maintaining or increasing current levels of revenues and achieving technological advances that will further reduce material costs of sales 
we expect service margins to decrease over the next several quarters due to increased headcount related costs to service increased installed base of systems  our new products expected to be introduced in fiscal and additional costs at odg as it expands its operations beyond the uk our operating expenses increased million or in fiscal over fiscal in comparison to a million or increase in fiscal over fiscal this increase is principally attributable to a full year of odg operating expenses in fiscal year as compared with four months in fiscal year  the hiring of additional employees to support new middleware product initiatives  a full year of amortization of intangibles for the liberate and odg acquisitions from the second and third quarters of fiscal  respectively  and stock compensation expense of million relating to adoption of fas r 
we expect operating expenses to continue to increase in fiscal in support of increased business activity 
equity income in earnings of affiliates was million in fiscal in comparison to  in fiscal reflecting million from our investment in filmflex in fiscal compared to a loss of approximately  in fiscal the results of our operations in fiscal were a net loss of million or per share as compared to net loss of million or per share in fiscal the primary contributors to our million increase in cash in fiscal year were net sales and maturities of marketable securities  proceeds from the issuance of common stock relating to stock options and employee stock purchases  partially offset by our net loss adjusted for non cash depreciation  amortization and stock compensation expense  the cash payment made to c cor incorporated as successor to ncube corp 
in settlement of the now resolved patent infringement litigation  capital expenditures  contingent consideration cash payment for fiscal made to the sellers of odg and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
we believe there are significant uncertainties about our ability to be profitable in fiscal these uncertainties include the timing and magnitude of orders from new customers located primarily outside the united states and the timing and magnitude of orders from our largest us customer who has represented and of our total revenues in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in addition  it is uncertain as to the extent to which our broadcast product enhancements will be accepted in its targeted markets 
there also continues to be pricing pressures from our competitors across all our product lines 
revenues for fiscal year are also dependent upon the timely introduction and customer acceptance of new products within each of our product families 
summary of critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these items are regularly monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
we believe that the accounting policies described below are critical to understanding our business  results of operations and financial condition because they involve significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires a judgment or accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain  and if different estimates that could have been used  or if changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed the development  selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and our audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
other significant accounting policies  primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed below  are also critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements 
the notes to our consolidated financial statements contain additional information related to our accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with this discussion 
principles of consolidation 
the company consolidates the financial statements of its wholly owned subsidiaries and all inter company accounts are properly eliminated in consolidation 
seachange also holds minority investments in the capital stock of certain private companies having product offerings or customer relationships that have strategic importance 
the company evaluates its equity and debt investments and other contractual relationships with affiliate companies in order to determine whether the guidelines of fasb interpretation fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  as revised under fin r should be applied in the financial statements 
fin r addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities that possess certain characteristics 
the company has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary for any variable interest entities as of january  the company s investments in affiliates include investments accounted for under the cost method and the equity method of accounting 
the investments that represent less than a ownership interest of the common shares of the affiliate are carried at cost 
under the equity method of accounting  which generally applies to investments that represent to ownership of the common shares of the affiliate  seachange s proportionate ownership share of the earnings or losses of the affiliate are included in equity income loss in earnings of affiliates in the consolidated statement of operations 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts 
the accounting related to revenue recognition is complex and affected by interpretations of the rules and an understanding of industry practices 
as a result  revenue recognition accounting rules require us to make significant judgments 
our judgment is required in assessing the probability of collection  which is generally based on evaluation of customer specific information  historical collection experience and economic market conditions 
revenues from sales of hardware  software and systems that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software are recognized when title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  there is evidence of an arrangement  fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is considered probable 
customers are billed for installation  training  project management and at least one year of product maintenance and technical support at the time of the product sale 
revenue from these activities are deferred at the time of the product sale and recognized ratably over the period these services are performed 
revenue from ongoing product maintenance and technical support agreements are recognized ratably over the period of the related agreements 
revenue from software development contracts that include significant modification or customization  including software product enhancements  is recognized based on the percentage of completion contract accounting method using labor efforts expended in relation to estimates of total labor efforts to complete the contract 
for contracts  where some level of profit is assured but the company is only able to estimate ranges of amounts of total contract revenue and total contract cost  the company uses the lowest probable level of profits in accounting for the contract revenues and costs 
accounting for contract amendments and customer change orders are included in contract accounting when executed 
revenue from shipping and handling costs and other out of pocket expenses reimbursed by customers are included in revenues and cost of revenues 
our share of intercompany profits associated with sales and services provided to affiliated companies are eliminated in consolidation in proportion to our equity ownership 
our transactions frequently involve the sales of hardware  software  systems and services in multiple element arrangements 
revenues under multiple element arrangements are recorded based on the residual method of accounting 
under this method  the total arrangement value is allocated first to undelivered elements  based on their fair values  with the remainder being allocated to the delivered elements 
the amounts allocated to undelivered elements  which may include project management  training  installation  maintenance and technical support and hardware and software components  are based upon the price charged when these elements are sold separately and unaccompanied by the other elements 
the amount allocated to installation  training and project management revenue is based upon standard hourly billing rates and the estimated time required to complete the service 
these services are not essential to the functionality of systems as these services do not alter the equipment s capabilities  are available from other vendors and the systems are standard products 
for multiple element arrangements that include software development with significant modification or customization and systems sales where vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value does not exist for the undelivered elements of the arrangement other than maintenance and technical support  percentage of completion accounting is applied for revenue recognition purposes to the entire arrangement with the exception of maintenance and technical support 
where fair value of undelivered service elements has not been established  the total arrangement value is recognized over the period during which the services are performed 
for transactions in which consideration  including equity instruments  is given to a customer  seachange accounts for the value of this consideration as an adjustment to revenue 
we must apply judgment in determining all elements of the arrangement and in determining the fair value for each element 
we recognize revenue for product and services only in those situations where collection from the customer is probable 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of customers financial condition but generally does not require collateral 
for some international customers  the company requires an irrevocable letter of credit to be issued by the customer before the purchase order is accepted 
the company monitors payments from customers and assesses any collection issues 
the company maintains allowances for specific doubtful accounts and other risk categories of accounts based on estimates of losses resulting from the inability of the company s customers to make required payments and records these allowances as a charge to general and administrative expenses 
the company bases its allowances for doubtful accounts on historical collections and write off experience  current trends  credit assessments  and other analysis of specific customer situations 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowances established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
if the financial condition of our customers were to change  additional allowances may be required or established allowances may be considered unnecessary 
judgment is required in making these determinations and our failure to accurately estimate the losses for doubtful accounts and ensure that payments are received on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any taxes assessed by a governmental authority related to revenue producing transactions eg sales or value added taxes are reported on a net basis and excluded from revenues 
inventories and reserves for obsolescence 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
cost is determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
inventories consist primarily of components  subassemblies and finished products held for sale 
all of our hardware components are purchased from outside vendors 
we depend upon certain vendors for the manufacture of significant components for all of our products 
if these vendors were to become unwilling or unable to manufacture these products in required volumes  we would have to identify and qualify acceptable alternative vendors 
the inability to develop alternative sources  if required in the future  could result in delays or reductions in product shipments and thereby adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our manufacturing  finance and operations personnel monitor quarterly the inventories to determine that the carrying value is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
we record charges to reduce inventory to its net realizable value when an impairment is identified through the quarterly management review process 
obsolete inventory  consisting of on hand components  subassemblies and finished products  is written down to its estimated net realizable value  if less than cost 
the obsolescence evaluation is based upon assumptions and estimates about future demand and possible alternative uses and involves significant judgments 
in fiscal and  we recorded inventory write downs of  and  investments in affiliates 
investments in affiliates include equity investments accounted for under the cost method or the equity method of accounting 
for investments that represent less than a ownership interest of the affiliate  the investments are carried at cost 
under the equity method of accounting  which generally applies to investments that represent to ownership of the common stock of the affiliate  our proportionate ownership share of the earnings or losses of the affiliate is recorded as equity income loss in earnings of affiliates in our consolidated statement of operations 
we are required to exercise judgment in determining whether an investment is more accurately reflected using the cost or equity method 
we periodically review indicators of the fair value of our investments in affiliates in order to assess whether available facts or circumstances  both internally and externally  may suggest an other than temporary decline in the value of the investment 
the carrying value of an investment in an affiliate may be affected by the affiliate s ability to obtain adequate funding and execute its business plans  general market conditions  industry considerations specific to the affiliate s business  and other factors 
the inability of an affiliate to obtain future funding or successfully execute its business plan could adversely affect our equity earnings of the affiliate in the periods affected by those events 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the affiliates could result in equity losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments in affiliates that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
we record an impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
accounting for acquisitions 
we have completed business acquisitions that resulted in goodwill and other intangible asset balances 
our accounting for acquisitions involves judgments and estimates primarily  but not limited to the estimates of fair values of certain acquired intangible assets which may involve projections of future revenues and cash flows  of acquired tangible acquired assets  of assumed liabilities and contingencies  and the estimated useful lives of acquired long lived assets  and the accounting for income taxes in purchase accounting 
the values we record for goodwill and other intangible assets represent fair values primarily calculated by using a discounted cash flow valuation method 
such valuations depend upon significant estimates and assumptions that are derived from information obtained from the management of the acquired businesses and our business plans for the acquired businesses or intellectual property 
these estimates and assumptions used in the initial valuation of goodwill and intangible assets include  but are not limited to future expected cash flows from product sales  customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to complete any in process research and development projects and commercialize viable products and estimated cash flows from sales of such products  the acquired companies brand awareness and market position  assumptions about the period of time over which we will continue to use the acquired products or services  and discount rates 
these estimates and assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate because unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
if estimates and assumptions used to initially value goodwill and intangible assets prove to be inaccurate  ongoing reviews of the carrying values of such goodwill and intangible assets  as discussed below  may indicate impairment which will require us to record an impairment charge in the period in which we identify the impairment 
changes in assumptions and estimates related to acquisitions could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
valuation of goodwill and other long lived assets 
other long lived assets include million of property and equipment  million of intangible assets and million of purchased software for resale as of january  goodwill  of million as of january   was acquired primarily through the purchases of odg and liberate 
whereas  the intangible assets have been subject to amortization since acquisition  the software  which was acquired in fiscal and fiscal  began amortization in the first half of fiscal we review goodwill for impairment annually and periodically review both goodwill and intangibles for the existence of facts or circumstances  both internal and external  which may suggest an asset is not recoverable that is  the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the asset s use and eventual disposition 
factors we consider important that could trigger the impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decrease in the market value of the long lived asset  significant adverse change to the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used or in its physical condition  significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  significant decline in our technological value as compared to the market  and a reduction in our market capitalization relative to net book value 
if such circumstances exist  we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to determine if impairment exists based upon estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and comparing that value to the carrying value of the assets 
if the carrying value of the asset is greater than the estimated future undiscounted cash flows  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 
we determine the estimated fair value of the assets on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the current business model 
in determining expected future cash flows  assets are grouped at the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable and independent of cash flows from other asset groups 
our cash flow projections contain management s best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
we believe there is no impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets as of january  accounting for income taxes 
we record income taxes using the asset and liability method 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we evaluate the weight of all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
we will record a valuation allowance if the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets in the future is reduced based on an evaluation of objective verifiable evidence 
significant management judgment is required in determining our income tax expense benefit  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
we have established a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets due to indications that they may not be fully realized 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable is subject to change based on future events  including generating sufficient pre tax income in future periods 
we maintained a full valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets primarily due to the significant historical pre tax losses and the significant ongoing uncertainties surrounding the ability of the us entity  seachange international  inc  to generate pre tax income for fiscal and thereafter 
in addition  seachange maintains a valuation allowance for the full amount of certain foreign tax assets 
at january   the valuation allowance was million 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we established reserves for uncertain tax positions that reflect our best estimate of the transactions and deductions that we may be unable to sustain or that we may be willing to concede as part of a broader tax settlement 
we are subject to undergoing routine tax examinations by federal  state  and foreign jurisdictions 
tax authorities may challenge certain transactions and deductions we reported on our income tax returns 
we do not expect the outcome of these examinations  either individually or in the aggregate  to have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
accounting for contingencies 
we are subject to certain claims and litigation  including proceedings under government laws and regulations and commercial disputes relating to our operations  including ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business 
we review and determine which liabilities  if any arising from these claims and litigations could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
loss contingency liabilities are recorded for these contingencies based on careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside counsel when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
in fiscal  we recorded charges of million associated with an unfavorable jury verdict in connection with the litigation with ncube  million of this amount was for accrued settlement costs 
our reserve at january   fully covered the settlement costs including interest accrued through that date 
on april  the us district court granted ncube s motions for damages  attorneys fees  costs and interest of million which was fully paid to c cor incorporated on april  as the successor in interest to ncube 
foreign currency translation 
we have determined that the functional currency of all but one of our foreign subsidiaries is the us dollar 
where the us dollar is designated as the functional currency of an entity  we translate that entity s monetary assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies into us dollars the functional and reporting currency at current exchange rates  as of each balance sheet date 
nonmonetary assets eg  inventories  property  plant  and equipment and intangible assets and related income statement accounts eg  cost of sales  depreciation  amortization of intangible assets are translated at historical exchange rates between the functional currency the us dollar and the local currency 
revenue and other expense items are translated using average exchange rates during the fiscal period 
translation adjustments and transactions gains and losses on foreign currency transactions  and any unrealized gains and losses on short term inter company transactions are included in income 
for the single foreign subsidiary where the local currency is designated as the functional currency  we translate its assets and liabilities into us dollars the reporting currency at current exchange rates as of each balance sheet date 
revenue and expense items are translated using average exchange rates during the period 
cumulative translation adjustments are presented as a separate component of stockholders equity 
exchange gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and unrealized gains and losses on short term inter company transactions are included in income 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital or incurring debt 
other than our equity investment in casa systems and filmflex see note included in the consolidated financial statements and liquidity and capital resources  we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of our capital resources 
fiscal year ended january  compared to the fiscal year ended january  product revenues 
our product revenues consist of sales of hardware  software and systems from our broadband and broadcast segments 
year ended january  broadband revenues video on demand revenues advertising revenues total broadband revenues broadcast revenues total product revenues our total product revenues increased to million in the fiscal year ended january  from million in the fiscal year ended january  revenues from the broadband segment  which accounted for of product revenues in fiscal and of product revenues in fiscal  increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal advertising product revenues were million for the fiscal year ended january  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended january  video on demand product revenues increased to million for the fiscal year ended january  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended january  the significant increase in video on demand product revenues between years related to a million increase in software development revenue in connection with the vod purchase agreement with comcast signed during the quarter ended july   and software development revenue derived from the middleware contracts acquired from liberate technologies in july the remaining million increase in video on demand product revenues stemmed from increased video on demand systems revenue tied to higher demand for our products from north american cable systems operators 
the increase in video on demand product revenue was partially offset by a decrease in revenues from our advertising products due to lower order activity related to customer conversion from analog to digital advertising insertion systems 
broadcast product revenues were million in the fiscal year ended january  compared to million in the fiscal year ended january   representing a increase 
the increase in broadcast revenues is due primarily to a million order from the us government recorded in the second quarter of fiscal partially offset by lower year over year order activity for the remainder of this operating segment 
we expect future revenue growth  if any  to come principally from our video on demand products as telecommunications companies  both in north america and internationally  begin to deploy video on demand systems  north american cable companies continue to expand their existing deployments of video on demand systems  and we expand our existing product line of video on demand products with new hardware and software products and services 
services revenues 
our services revenues consist of fees for installation  training  project management  product maintenance and technical support  software development  and movie content services 
our services revenues increased to million in the year ended january  from million in the year ended january  the growth in services revenue is primarily attributable to a full year of odg s media content services  or million  recognized in fiscal in comparison to only four months  or million  recognized in fiscal from the date of seachange s acquisition of odg in september in addition  million of the increase in services revenues between years is attributable to the increase in video on demand product maintenance contracts and other technical support services from a growing installed base of vod systems 
revenues from services are expected to continue to grow from our expanding installed base of products and additional service offerings 
for the fiscal year ended january   two customers each accounted for more than and collectively  accounted for of our total revenues  and one customer accounted for more than of our total revenues for the year ended january  revenues from these customers were primarily in the broadband segment 
we believe that a significant amount of our revenues will continue to be derived from a limited number of customers 
international products and services revenues accounted for approximately and of total revenues in the fiscal years ended january  and  respectively 
customers in the us and united kingdom each accounted for more than and collectively accounted for and of total revenue in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
revenues from european customers increased to million from million in the fiscal years ended january  and january   respectively 
the increase in european revenues was primarily attributable to uk customers that generated million in revenues in the fiscal year ended january  the increase in revenues from the united kingdom is primarily due to the service revenues from the video content services provided by odg for the full fiscal year in comparison to four months from the acquisition date in fiscal in addition  the middleware software development revenues included a full year in fiscal from the contracts acquired from liberate technologies in comparison to six months from the acquisition date in fiscal we expect that international products and services revenues will remain a significant portion of our business in the future 
since substantially all of our product sales are made in united states dollars usd  we have not experienced  nor do we expect to experience in the near term  any material impact from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations 
with the acquisition of odg  which has designated the great britain pound gbp as its functional currency  their service sales  primarily payable in gbp  provide a natural hedge for payments in local currency 
thus  we do not expect to experience  nor have we experienced any material impact on our results from fluctuations in foreign currency transactions from odg operations 
however  since the odg operation is translated to usd for reporting purposes  translation gains and losses  as a result of foreign currency rate fluctuations  are recorded in the equity section of our balance sheet 
we continue to expect exposure in fluctuations in the usd gbp exchange rate in the equity section of our balance sheet in the future 
product gross profit 
costs of product revenues consist primarily of the cost of purchased material components and subassemblies  labor and overhead costs relating to the final assembly and testing of complete systems  and related expenses and labor and overhead costs related to software development contracts 
costs of product revenues increased to million  or of the related product revenues in the fiscal year ended january  as compared to million or of related product revenues  in the fiscal year ended january  in fiscal  the increase in the costs of product revenues primarily reflects the increased revenues 
costs of product revenues as a percentage of revenues decreased due to the increased revenues from higher margin software development contracts 
product gross profit for the broadband segment increased to of related revenues in fiscal from of related revenues in fiscal the increase in broadband gross profit percentages is primarily due to increased revenues from higher margin software development contracts 
product gross profit for the broadcast segment was up from of related product revenues in fiscal to of related product revenues in fiscal services gross profit 
cost of services revenues consist primarily of labor  materials and overhead relating to the installation  training  product maintenance and technical support  software development  project management and costs associated with providing video content services 
costs of services revenues increased from million or of services revenues in the year ended january  to million or of services revenues in the year ended january   primarily due to a full year of odg costs of services in fiscal year as compared with four months in fiscal year we expect that service gross profit percentage will decrease over the next several quarters due to increased headcount related costs to service our increased installed base of systems  our new products expected to be introduced in fiscal and additional costs at odg as it expands its operations beyond the uk research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of the compensation of development personnel  depreciation of development and test equipment and an allocation of related facilities expenses 
research and development expenses increased from million  or of total revenues  in the fiscal year ended january  to million  or of total revenues  in the fiscal year ended january  primarily due to million in increased salaries and benefits attributable to the hiring of additional development engineers primarily to support middleware products and stock compensation expense of million due to adoption of fas r 
we expect that research and development expenses will continue to increase in fiscal year as we continue our development of our new products and enhancements 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation expenses  including sales commissions  travel expenses and certain promotional expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased from million or of total revenues in the fiscal year ended january  to million  or of total revenues  in the fiscal year ended january  this increase is primarily due to million in increased salaries and benefits attributable to the hiring of additional sales and marketing employees  increased commissions of approximately  due to higher revenues  and stock compensation expense of approximately  due to adoption of fas r 
we expect selling and marketing expenses to increase in fiscal as we continue to expand our product offerings and increase our selling presence in overseas markets 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the compensation of executive  finance  human resource and administrative personnel  legal and accounting services and an allocation of related facilities expenses 
in the fiscal year ended january   general and administrative expenses of million  or of total revenues  increased from million  or of total revenues  in the fiscal year ended january  due to million attributable to a full year of odg general and administrative expense in fiscal year as compared with four months in fiscal year  million due to the hiring of additional general and administrative employees  million due to stock compensation expense  an increase in the bad debt provision of approximately  in fiscal in comparison with net bad debt recoveries of approximately  in fiscal  all partially offset by a reduction in professional fees of approximately  some of which related to fiscal acquisitions 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization expense consists of the amortization of acquired intangible assets which are operating expenses and not considered costs of revenues 
amortization of intangible assets was million in the fiscal year ended january  and million in the fiscal year ended in january  the increase in amortization expense is attributable to the acquisitions of liberate and odg in the second and third quarters of fiscal  respectively 
the table below classifies the amortization expense by its source category  sales and marketing or general and administrative expense 
amounts in thousands for the year ended january  for the year ended january  sales and marketing expense general and administrative expense amortization expense an additional  and  of amortization expense related to acquired technology was charged to cost of sales for the years ended january  and  respectively 
interest income and interest expense 
interest income was million in the fiscal year ended january  and million in the fiscal year ended january  interest expense was  for the fiscal year ended january  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended january  the decrease in interest income is primarily due to the decrease in marketable securities during the fiscal year ended january  in comparison to the fiscal year ended january  impairment on investment in affiliate 
impairment on investment in affiliate was a loss of  in the fiscal year ended january  due to the impairment of a small investment in an affiliate company and none in the fiscal year ended january  equity income in earnings of affiliates 
equity income in earnings of affiliates was million in the fiscal year ended january  compared with  in the fiscal year ended january  the equity income in earnings of affiliates consists of our proportionate ownership share of the net income loss under the equity method of accounting 
for fiscal  the equity income in earnings of affiliates consisted of our proportionate ownership share of the earnings of filmflex 
for fiscal  the equity income in earnings of affiliates consisted of our proportionate ownership share of the earnings of odg until we purchased of the company in september as part of the odg acquisition  we increased our ownership interest to in filmflex for which we recorded our proportionate ownership share of its net income or loss from the acquisition date 
the year over year increase in earnings from our investment in filmflex was million offset by the loss of approximately  from odg in fiscal prior to our acquisition of the remaining interest in odg 
income tax benefit 
our effective tax rate and income tax benefit was or million and or million for fiscal years ended january  and  respectively 
for the fiscal year  the income tax benefit was primarily attributable to  of net operating losses generated during the current fiscal year that are expected to be carried back to recover taxes paid in prior years and the change in estimate of the prior year s tax provision relating to the tax benefit booked for the fiscal federal loss carryback versus the actual cash refund received of  at january  and january   we provided a valuation allowance for the full amount of net deferred tax assets recorded in the united states due to the uncertainty of realization of those assets as a result of the current fiscal year s pre tax losses and uncertainties related to our ability to generate pre tax income for fiscal and thereafter 
in addition  seachange maintains a valuation allowance for the full amount of certain foreign tax assets 
we will continue to assess the need for the valuation allowance at each balance sheet date based on all available evidence 
if we determine that we can generate sufficient future pre tax income  some portion or all of the valuation allowance would be reversed and a corresponding increase in net income would be recognized 
fiscal year ended january  compared to the fiscal year ended january  product revenues 
our product revenue consists of sales of hardware  software and systems from our broadband and broadcast segments 
year ended january  broadband revenues video on demand revenues advertising revenues total broadband revenues broadcast revenues total product revenues our total product revenues decreased to million in the fiscal year ended january  from million in the fiscal year ended january  revenues from the broadband segment  which accounted for of total revenues in fiscal and of total revenues in fiscal  decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal advertising product revenues were million for the fiscal year ended january  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended january  video on demand product revenues  excluding software development revenues  decreased to million for the fiscal year ended january  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended january  revenues from video on demand product for the fiscal year ended january  were increased by million for the adjustment recorded in connection with the final agreement with comcast see note to financial statements concerning incentive common stock purchase warrants 
the decrease in broadband revenues reflects a decline in demand by us cable operators  including a significant decline in revenues from our largest us customer and price decreases partially offset by increased revenues from the initial deployment of video on demand systems in europe and the new middleware software revenues of million from customer contracts acquired from liberate technologies 
this decrease was also partially offset by an increase in revenues from our advertising products due to an increase in demand for digital advertising systems  reflecting cable operators replacement of the analog technology with digital technology 
broadcast product revenues were million in the fiscal year ended january  compared to million in the fiscal year ended january  the decrease in broadcast revenues during the fiscal year ended january  was primarily attributable to the delay in the introduction and initial customer acceptance of the new products 
services revenues 
our services revenues consist of fees for installation  training  project management  product maintenance and technical support  software development  and movie content services 
our services revenues increased to million in the year ended january  from million in the year ended january  this increase in service revenues primarily resulted from the annual renewals of product maintenance and technical support service contracts from our expanding installed base of products and million of revenues from odg s video content services recorded since the acquisition of odg in september software development and professional services revenues from our wholly owned subsidiary  digital video arts  increased to million in the fiscal year ended january  from million in the fiscal year ended january  for the fiscal years ended january  and  one customer accounted for more than of our total revenues 
this customer accounted for and of revenues in the fiscal years ended january  and  respectively 
revenue from this customer was primarily in the broadband segment 
international products and services revenues accounted for approximately and of total revenues in the fiscal years ended january  and  respectively 
both us and united kingdom customers accounted for more than of total revenue in fiscal the us was the only country to account for more than of total revenues in fiscal revenues from european customers increased from million to million in the fiscal years ended january  and january   respectively 
the increase in european revenues was primarily attributable to uk customers 
the increase in revenues from the united kingdom is primarily due to the expansion of the video on demand system deployments by united kingdom cable operators  software revenues generated from our uk customer contracts recently acquired from liberate technologies  and the service revenues from the video content services provided by on demand group since its acquisition 
product gross profit 
costs of product revenues consist primarily of the cost of purchased material components and subassemblies  labor and overhead relating to the final assembly and testing of complete systems and related expenses 
costs of product revenues decreased to million  or of related product revenues  in the fiscal year ended january  as compared to million  or of related product revenues  in the fiscal year ended january  in the fiscal  the decrease in the costs of product revenues primarily reflects the decrease of the video on demand systems revenue 
product gross profit for the broadband segment decreased from of related revenues in fiscal to of related revenues in fiscal the decrease in broadband gross profit percentages is primarily due to lower video on demand product revenues offset in part by an increase in software revenues from customer contracts recently acquired from liberate technologies 
product gross profit for the broadcast segment was down from of related product revenues in fiscal year to of related product revenues in fiscal the decrease in gross profit percentage is primarily due to lower revenues  higher discounts on certain broadcast orders as a result of competitive pressures and the additional cost of sales necessary to enhance the performance of certain systems 
services gross profit 
cost of services revenues consist primarily of labor  materials and overhead relating to the installation  training  product maintenance and technical support  software development  project management provided by us and costs associated with providing video content services 
costs of services revenues increased from million or of services revenues in the year ended january  to million or of services revenues in the year ended january   primarily due to additional costs of services generated as a result of the acquisition of odg in september the increase in services gross profit was primarily due higher revenue levels and a relatively fixed cost base and the added margin generated from the on demand group revenues recognized since the acquisition in september research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of the compensation of development personnel  depreciation of development and test equipment and an allocation of related facilities expenses 
research and development expenses increased from million  or of total revenues  in the fiscal year ended january  to million  or of total revenues  in the fiscal year ended january  primarily due to the hiring of additional development engineers to support new product initiatives million and additional development costs incurred by odg  after its acquisition date 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation expenses  including sales commissions  travel expenses and certain promotional expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased from million or of total revenues  in the fiscal year ended january  to million  or of total revenues  in the fiscal year ended january  this increase is primarily due to increased tradeshow and travel expenses related to increased direct sales efforts partially offset by reduced sales commissions on lower revenues 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the compensation of executive  finance  human resource and administrative personnel  legal and accounting services and an allocation of related facilities expenses 
in the fiscal year ended january   general and administrative expenses of million  or of total revenues  increased from million  or of total revenues  in the fiscal year ended january  due to million of higher accounting and consulting fees associated with the company s acquisitions and investments in affiliates and compliance with sarbanes oxley legislation  million to further develop operations on a world wide basis and particularly in china  and  additional general and administrative expenses incurred by odg after the acquisition date 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reversed charges related to the retirement agreement for our chief financial officer due to the execution of a management transition agreement which continues his employment through january  with no retirement benefits 
the fiscal year general and administrative expenses differ from the amount reported in our earnings release  issued march   by an additional  of interest expense recorded in connection with our patent infringement litigation accrual 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangible assets was million in the fiscal year ended january  and million in the fiscal year ended in january  this increase in amortization of intangibles is primarily due to the acquisitions of intangible assets acquired from liberate technologies non north american business in july and from the step acquisition of odg in september interest income and interest expense 
interest income was million in the fiscal year ended january  and million in the fiscal year ended january  in fiscal  we recorded an  adjustment  net of taxes to reduce interest income to properly account for the amortization of market premiums and discounts on acquired marketable securities 
equity income loss in earnings of affiliates 
equity income in earning of affiliates was  in the fiscal year ended january  and equity loss in earnings of affiliates was  in the fiscal year ended january  for fiscal  the equity income in earnings of affiliates consisted of our proportionate ownership share of the earnings of odg until we purchased of the company in september as part of the odg acquisition  we also increased our ownership interest to in filmflex for which we recorded our proportionate ownership share of its net loss since the acquisition date 
for fiscal  the equity loss in earnings of affiliates consisted of our proportionate ownership share of the net loss of odg under the equity method of accounting 
income tax expense benefit 
our effective tax rate was and for fiscal years ended january  and  respectively 
for the fiscal year ended january   we recorded a million income tax benefit that is primarily attributable to operating losses generated during the current fiscal year that are expected to be carried back to recover prior year taxes paid 
at january   we provided a valuation allowance for the full amount of net deferred tax assets recorded in the united states due to the uncertainty of realization of those assets as a result of the current fiscal year s pre tax losses and uncertainties related to our ability to generate pre tax income for fiscal and thereafter 
in addition  seachange maintains a valuation allowance for the full amount of certain foreign tax assets 
we have experienced a significant decline in product revenues since the fourth quarter of fiscal  which was primarily attributable to a decline in video on demand systems revenues that subsequently resulted in lower gross margins and net losses 
we will continue to assess the need for the valuation allowance at each balance sheet date based on all available evidence 
if we determine that we can generate sufficient future pre tax income  some portion or all of the valuation allowance would be reversed and a corresponding increase in net income would be recognized 
income tax expense for fiscal year included a million benefit primarily related to the implementation of a tax law change relating to the tax treatment of deferred revenues which resulted in the realization of an associated deferred tax asset and a corresponding valuation allowance release as seachange began to follow the same method for both book and tax purposes for recognizing revenue for maintenance service contracts 
seachange had an effective income tax rate of for the year ended january  before recording the adjustment discussed above 
quarterly results of operations the following table presents unaudited financial information for the quarterly periods in the fiscal years ended january  and january  the results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of future quarterly results  and we believe that period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
three months ended april  july  october  january  april  july  october  january  in thousands  except per share amounts revenue gross profit operating expenses net income loss earnings loss per share basic earnings loss per share diluted we have experienced significant variations in revenues  expenses and operating results from quarter to quarter and such variations are likely to continue 
a significant portion of our revenues have been generated from a limited number of customers  and it is difficult to predict the timing of future orders and shipments to these and other customers 
customers can cancel or reschedule shipments  and development or production difficulties could delay shipments 
during the fiscal quarterly periods outlined above  we experienced increases in our revenues compared to the quarterly periods in fiscal primarily related to the increase in software development revenues in fiscal in connection with the vod purchase agreement signed with comcast in july of  the increase in video on demand systems revenue related to increased demand for our products from north american cable system operators and the full year impact of the odg acquisition and liberate middleware contracts in fiscal we have also experienced significant variations in our quarterly product gross profit 
changes in pricing policies  the product mix  the timing and significance of new product introductions and product enhancements  and fluctuations in the number of systems affects manufacturing efficiencies and  accordingly  gross profits 
quarterly services gross profits have historically fluctuated significantly because installation and training service revenue varies by quarter while the related costs are relatively consistent by quarter 
gross profits for fiscal were higher than quarterly gross profits for fiscal principally due to higher revenues for the reasons cited above and a greater mix of higher margin software development revenue 
in addition  our gross profit for the quarter ended january  reflected the impact of approximately million of fiscal year sales discounts in connection with the month extension of a middleware development contract 
during the quarterly periods outlined above  we generally experienced sequential increases in our operating expenses with the exception of the third quarter of fiscal when operating expenses decreased due to the start of the reclassification to cost of goods sold of software development expenses related to the comcast agreement 
operating expenses  also vary somewhat with the number  timing and significance of new product and product enhancement introductions by us and our competitors  increased competition  the gain or loss of significant customers  the hiring of new personnel  the acquisition of businesses  and general economic conditions 
our selling and marketing costs fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of commissions related to our revenues  large tradeshows that take place in the first and third quarter of the year and significant promotional costs that are incurred for new product introductions 
all of the above factors are difficult for us to forecast  and these or other factors may have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations for one quarter or a series of quarters 
only a small portion of our expenses vary with revenues in the short term and there would likely be a material adverse effect on our operating results if future revenues are lower than expectations 
based upon all of the forgoing  we believe that quarterly revenues and operating results are likely to vary significantly in the future and that period to period comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily with the proceeds from sales of our common stock and cash flows generated from operations 
during fiscal  cash and cash equivalents increased million from million at january  to million at january  largely due to cash provided by certain operating  investing  and financing activities partially offset by our net loss 
working capital increased to million at january  from million at january  net cash provided by operating activities was  for the fiscal year ended january  compared to net cash used in operating activities of million for the fiscal year ended january  the net cash used for operating activities in the fiscal year ended january  was the result of a net loss of million and the million cash payment made to c cor incorporated as successor to ncube corp 
in settlement of the now resolved patent infringement litigation  which was offset by the non cash depreciation and amortization of intangible assets of million  stock compensation expense of million and the changes in certain operating assets and liabilities 
significant changes in operating assets and liabilities that provided cash included an income tax refund that reduced income taxes receivable by million  and an increase in deferred revenues of million 
the significant changes in assets and liabilities that used cash from operations included an increase in inventories of million  primarily due to inventory acquired and subsequently reclassified to fixed assets for use as research and development equipment  and a reduction in income taxes payable 
the share based compensation of million in fiscal increased from  in fiscal and million in fiscal due to the adoption of sfas r beginning february  it is typical for us to experience fluctuations in our monthly operating results primarily due to the timing of receiving customer orders and the related shipment of these customer orders 
as a result of these monthly fluctuations  we may experience significant increases or decreases in our inventories as a result of the timing of the procurement of components for anticipated orders for both our product segments and increases or decreases in our accounts receivable balances and customer deposits as a result of the timing of receiving customer orders during the period and of customer payments 
we expect that the video on demand products within the broadband segment will continue to require a significant amount of cash to fund future product development and additional capital expenditures for engineering equipment  quality systems and customer services test systems to meet higher forecasted revenue levels 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the fiscal year ended january  and net cash used in investing activities was million for the fiscal year ended january  investment activity for fiscal consisted primarily of million net maturities and sales of marketable securities partially offset by capital expenditures of million and the million contingent consideration cash payment made to the former shareholders of odg 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the fiscal year ended january  compared to million for the fiscal year ended january  in fiscal and fiscal  the cash provided by financing activities was comprised of proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we renewed our revolving line of credit with citizens bank a subsidiary of the royal bank of scotland group plc through june   for the committed amount of million 
loans made under this revolving line of credit bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the bank s prime rate which was on january  borrowings under this line of credit are collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
the loan agreement requires that we provide citizens bank with certain periodic financial reports and comply with certain financial ratios including a minimum level of earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation and amortization on a trailing twelve month basis  when amounts are outstanding under the loan agreement 
as of january   we were not in compliance with the financial covenants but obtained a waiver from the bank for the quarter ended january  there are currently no amounts outstanding under the revolving line of credit 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we purchased of the outstanding capital stock of the on demand group limited odg  a company incorporated under the laws of the united kingdom 
as a result of this purchase  we owned of odg at january  under the terms of the purchase agreement  we acquired the outstanding shares in odg we did not previously own in exchange for approximately million in cash consideration  including transaction costs of  the purchase agreement also provides for additional contingent consideration if odg meets certain annual performance goals related to net income over three measurement periods ending january  we may pay up to a maximum aggregate contingent consideration of million based on the exchange rate in effect at january   including up to payable in shares of our common stock  par value per share  with the remainder payable in cash provided that the performance goals are met 
the contingent consideration is comprised of three installments  each to be made annually  beginning with the year ending january   for an annual baseline amount of million  million and million  respectively based on the exchange rate in effect at january   june  and january   respectively 
these amounts are subject to upward and downward adjustment based on the actual net income related performance of odg  as clarified in the agreement  during these periods  provided that the aggregate maximum contingent consideration payable is the sum of these baseline amounts plus a maximum of million based on the exchange rate in effect at january  
the contingent consideration will be recorded as an additional cost of the purchase and recognized as goodwill if the performance measures are met by odg and it becomes payable 
on january   the first earnout measurement period ended  and we recorded million usd equivalent of additional purchase price as goodwill based upon odg s net income for the initial annual performance period ended january  in may  the company paid million usd equivalent at the current exchange rate to satisfy this obligation 
on june   seachange and the former stockholders of odg amended the original purchase agreement to provide for the acceleration of the second installment of contingent consideration for the year ended january  in exchange for the issuance to the sellers of  shares of seachange s common stock having a fair market value of million as of the date of the amendment 
consequently  the company recorded an additional million of goodwill to reflect the accelerated second installment of contingent consideration 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we acquired substantially all of the assets of liberate technologies business outside of north america 
at the time of the transaction  liberate technologies was a leading provider of software for digital cable systems 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  we acquired certain customer contracts  patents and other intellectual property  and assumed certain limited liabilities related to liberate s business outside of north america in exchange for approximately million in cash consideration 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we purchased for million real property located at nagog park drive in acton  massachusetts 
the building on the property is approximately  square feet  and this site is our new corporate headquarters 
all operations and personnel currently that were located at the facility in maynard  massachusetts were relocated to the new property in acton  massachusetts in february in the first quarter of fiscal  we entered into a stock purchase agreement with insite one  inc insite  an off site medical imaging and data services company 
as part of the agreement  we invested million for million shares of cumulative convertible preferred stock of insite representing approximately of the total capital stock of the insite 
the preferred shares are convertible to common stock based upon defined conversion factors subject to adjustment as defined in the agreement 
in fiscal  we converted a note receivable of  related to an insite one system sale to equity 
in january  we executed a secured loan agreement with casa systems  inc casa  a massachusetts development stage company that specializes in video on demand products within the telecommunications and television markets 
the original total loan commitment was million and  was drawn at the end of fiscal year during the first quarter of fiscal  we increased the total loan commitment to million  and casa drew down the remaining million 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we invested million in convertible preferred stock  which may convert to a ownership interest  in casa systems  inc casa  a massachusetts development stage company that specializes in video on demand products within the telecommunications and television markets 
a portion of the purchase price was satisfied by our surrender and cancellation of the million in principal plus accrued interest outstanding pursuant to the secured loan agreement with casa 
the remainder of the purchase price was paid in cash 
the investment was made for shares of casa s convertible preferred stock  convertible at our option into shares of casa s common stock on a one to one basis 
at the time of the investment  we also entered into agreements with casa  its stockholders and its optionholders which grant us the right of first refusal on the issuance of additional shares of casa securities or transfers of stock or options by holders 
in addition  we had a call option exercisable until january  to purchase all of the outstanding stock and options not owned by us for an aggregate price of million 
the company did not exercise this option 
in fiscal  seachange acquired all of the outstanding stock of zq interactive  ltd  a company incorporated in the british virgin islands with its principal office in shanghai  china 
according to the terms of the purchase agreement  million was paid to the sellers at the signing of the purchase agreement and the remaining million was to be paid to the sellers in two equal annual installments of  on the first and second anniversary dates of the signing of the purchase agreement 
the final installment of  was paid in july the following table reflects our current and contingent contractual obligations to make potential future payments as of january  in thousands payment due by period s total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years purchase obligations acquisition commitments studio content minimum guarantees non cancelable lease obligations total the purchase obligations and studio content minimum guarantees include open  non cancelable purchase commitments from our suppliers 
the acquisition commitments primarily include estimated maximum additional contingent consideration obligations in the event odg achieves specified annual performance thresholds in the future 
we believe that existing funds combined with available borrowings under the revolving line of credit and cash provided by future operating activities are adequate to satisfy our working capital  potential acquisitions and capital expenditure requirements and other contractual obligations for the foreseeable future  including at least the next months 
effects of inflation our management believes that financial results have not been significantly impacted by inflation and price changes

sfas no

the company does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on its financial statements 
in september  the sec staff released staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab was issued in order to eliminate the diversity of practice surrounding how public companies quantify financial statement misstatements 
traditionally  there have been two widely recognized methods for quantifying the effects of financial statement misstatements the roll over method and the iron curtain method 
the roll over method focuses primarily on the impact of a misstatement on the income statement  including the reversing effect of prior year misstatements  but its use can lead to the accumulation of misstatements in the balance sheet 
the iron curtain method focuses primarily on the effect of correcting the period end balance sheet with less emphasis on the reversing effects of prior year errors on the income statement 
the company previously used the roll over method for quantifying identified financial statement misstatements 
in sab  the sec staff established an approach that requires quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effect of the misstatements on each of the company s financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures 
this model is commonly referred to as a dual approach because it requires quantification of errors under both the iron curtain and the roll over methods 
sab permits public companies to initially apply its provisions either by i restating prior financial statements as if the dual approach had always been used or ii recording the cumulative effect of initially applying the dual approach as adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the year of adoption  february  for the company  with an offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings 
the company elected to record the effects of applying sab using the cumulative effect transition method 
the company identified two errors  quantified them under the roll over method and concluded they were immaterial  individually and in the aggregate 
inventory was increased by  to reflect labor and overhead costs that had  in the past  been treated as period costs and had not been capitalized as a component of inventory 
accumulated other comprehensive income loss was decreased by  to reflect a realized gain which should have been recognized in fiscal to record the initial application of sab  seachange recorded a  adjustment to decrease accumulated deficit at february  in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we face exposure to financial market risks  including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
our primary exposure has historically been associated with product sales arrangements denominated in the local currency where the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary is the us dollar as most of our revenues are in us dollars and operating expenses in europe and asia 
in light of the higher proportion of our international businesses due  in part  to the recent acquisitions of european based business from liberate technologies and odg  we expect the risk of any adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates to have a greater impact on our operating results in the future 
historically  we have not hedged specific currency exposures as gains and losses on foreign currency transactions have not been material to date 
at january  and january   we had outstanding related to variable rate us dollar denominated debt 
as there were no amounts outstanding at january  and related to variable rate debt  there was no interest rate exposure 
the carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheet of cash and cash equivalents  short term marketable securities  trade receivables and trade payables approximate fair value at january  due to the short maturities of these instruments 
we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types  and maturities 
our cash and marketable securities include cash equivalents  which we consider to be investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less 
given the short maturities and investment grade quality of the portfolio holdings at january   a sharp rise in interest rates should not have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
additionally  our long term marketable investments  which are carried at the lower of cost or market  have fixed interest rates  and therefore are not subject to any interest rate exposure 
as a result  we do not currently hedge these market risk exposures 
at january   we had million in short term marketable securities and million in long term marketable securities
