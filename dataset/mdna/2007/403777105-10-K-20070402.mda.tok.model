the company also operates two on line stores at www 
gymboree 
com and www 
janieandjack 
com 
on october   the board of directors authorized the company to proceed with the closure of its women s division janeville  stores  as a result of the division s inability to achieve the level of financial performance expected by management and the desire to focus existing resources on other opportunities 
all janeville stores were closed in the fourth quarter of fiscal the results of operations for the janeville division have been presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements for all periods presented 
the company s net sales for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal and million in fiscal net income totaled million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal comparable store net sales which include on line stores  based on a week period  increased during fiscal versus  during fiscal versus  and during fiscal versus the company expects that future increases in net sales and net income will be dependent on  among other factors  its ability to attract new customers through strategies such as direct mail campaigns and cross brand marketing  maintain existing customers longer in the core gymboree division through appropriate size expansions  continue to reduce product costs while maintaining high quality standards  and expand its two newer growth concepts  janie and jack and gymboree outlet 
the company s long term growth will depend on the development and implementation of newer retail concepts  such as janie and jack and gymboree outlet  as well as continued investment in its core retail brand  gymboree 
as such  the company expects to continue to devote time and effort to evaluating  developing  and testing new concepts when it perceives opportunities in the marketplace 
such efforts inevitably require significant management attention at all phases of the process and  for those concepts that the company 
table of contents determines to launch  significant capital expenditures and losses during the early years of operation 
in fiscal  the company plans to open a minimum of stores in a new concept in the children s apparel space 
the company anticipates that losses related to this new concept will reduce net income by approximately per diluted share in fiscal during  the company also plans to open approximately new gymboree stores  new gymboree outlet stores and new janie and jack shops 
the company also plans to remodel  relocate or expand approximately gymboree stores 
the company s year end is on the saturday closest to january fiscal  which included weeks  ended on february  fiscal and  which included weeks each  ended on january  and january   respectively 
management estimates that the rd week of fiscal contributed approximately per diluted share to income from continuing operations 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those accounting policies and estimates that management believes are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
share based compensation 
in fiscal  the company adopted sfas no 
r  share based compensation sfas r using the modified prospective transition method and began accounting for stock based compensation using a fair valued based recognition method 
under the provisions of sfas r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is expensed ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  expected term and forfeiture rates 
the company develops its estimates based on historical data and market information  which can change significantly over time 
the company uses the black scholes option valuation model to value employee share based awards 
the company estimates stock price volatility based on an average historical volatility of its stock 
expected term and forfeiture rate assumptions are also derived from historical data  giving consideration to expectations of future employee behavior 
the company recognizes compensation expense using the straight line amortization method 
had the company used alternative valuation methodologies or assumptions  the amount expensed for share based awards could be significantly different 
inventory valuation 
the company reviews its inventory levels in order to identify slow moving merchandise and broken assortments items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes and reduces prices to sell that merchandise 
the company takes a physical count of inventories in all stores and its retail distribution center once a year  and in some stores twice a year 
the company performs cycle counts of inventory for its on line stores throughout the year 
the company records an inventory shrink adjustment upon physical counts and also provides for estimated shrink adjustments for the period between the last physical inventory count and each balance sheet date 
our inventory shrink estimate can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shrink trends 
asset impairment 
the company reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the undiscounted future cash flows from the long lived assets are less than the carrying value  the company recognizes a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the assets 
decisions to close a store or facility can also result in accelerated depreciation over the revised useful life 
for locations to be closed which are under long term leases  the company records a charge for lease buyout expense or the difference between its rent and 
table of contents the rate at which it expects to be able to sublease the properties and related cost  as appropriate 
most closures occur upon the lease expiration 
the company s estimate of future cash flows is based on experience  knowledge and occasionally third party advice or market data 
however  these estimates can be affected by factors that are difficult to predict such as future store profitability  real estate demand and economic conditions 
workers compensation 
the company is partially self insured for workers compensation insurance 
the company records a liability based on claims filed and an actuarially determined amount of claims incurred  but not yet reported 
any actuarial projection of losses concerning the company s liability is subject to a high degree of variability due to external factors including future inflation rates  litigation trends  legal interpretations  benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns 
if the actual amount of claims filed exceeds estimates  reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional accruals may be required in future periods

the bank is the sole owner of the accounts issued under the program and absorbs all losses associated with non payment by the cardholder and any fraudulent usage of the accounts by third parties 
the company is responsible for redeeming the incentives  including the issuance of any gift cards 
the bank pays fees to the company based on the number of credit card accounts opened and card usage and makes certain guaranteed minimum annual payments 
visa usa inc also pays fees to the company based on card usage 
cardholder incentives are funded from the fees paid by the bank to the company 
the company recognizes revenues related to the agreements as follows new account fees are recognized as retail revenues on a straight line basis over the estimated life of the credit card relationship  currently estimated to be years 
credit card usage fees are recognized as retail revenues as actual credit card usage occurs 
minimum guaranteed annual payments  which exceed amounts earned based on the number of accounts opened and card usage  are recognized as retail revenues on a straight line basis over the estimated life of the credit card relationship  currently estimated to be years 
rewards earned are recorded as gift card liabilities and recognized as retail revenues when the gift cards are redeemed 
revenue recognition

a liability is recorded for all gymbucks earned  but not redeemed within an accounting period

the 
table of contents company maintains valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax provision in the period of change 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted  the company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history  expected future earnings  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
the company is subject to periodic audits by the internal revenue service  and other taxing authorities 
these audits may challenge certain of the company s tax positions  such as the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of taxable income to the various tax jurisdictions 
loss and gain contingencies are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and may require significant management judgment in estimating final outcomes 
actual results could materially differ from these estimates and could significantly affect the effective tax rate and cash flows in future years
