overview we are a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company marketing two fda approved products with our national primary care sales force a cardiovascular product  antara fenofibrate capsules and a fluoroquinolone antibiotic  factive gemifloxacin mesylate tablets 
antara is approved by the fda to treat hypercholesterolemia high blood cholesterol and hypertriglyceridemia high triglycerides in combination with a healthy diet 
our national sales force began marketing antara in late august the market for fenofibrate products was approximately billion in and the us market for treating dyslipidemias was approximately billion in in connection with our acquisition of antara  we were assigned the us rights to antara under an exclusive license from ethypharm us factive is approved for the treatment of community acquired pneumonia  or cap  of mild to moderate severity and acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis  or aecb 
we license the rights to gemifloxacin  the active ingredient in factive tablets  from lg life sciences 
we launched factive in the us market in september additionally  we have a novel  late stage antibiotic candidate  ramoplanin  under investigation for the treatment of clostridium difficile associated disease and have begun exploring partnering and other strategic opportunities for the continued development of ramoplanin 
our strategy is to identify new products to acquire  in license or co promote for the us market place in order to leverage our existing commercial infrastructure 
we have incurred significant operating losses in the past 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to incur additional operating losses due to the implementation of manufacturing  distribution  marketing and sales capabilities 
antara antara is a once daily formulation of fenofibrate approved for use in combination with a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol to reduce elevated low density lipoprotein cholesterol ldl or bad cholesterol  triglyceride and apolipoprotein b free floating fats in the blood levels  and to increase high density lipoprotein 
table of contents cholesterol hdl or good cholesterol in adult patients with high cholesterol or an abnormal concentration of lipids in the blood 
fenofibrate products work primarily to lower triglycerides and increase hdl cholesterol  which makes the drug an attractive alternative for those patients whose ldl cholesterol is well controlled 
antara received fda approval in november we began marketing antara in mg and mg doses in august on august   we acquired rights to antara in the us from reliant pharmaceuticals inc for million plus a million payment for antara inventory  exclusive of estimated transaction costs 
under the terms of our acquisition of antara  we assumed certain of reliant s liabilities related to antara  including obligations to make certain royalty and milestone payments on sales of antara  and we were assigned rights to an exclusive license to the rights to antara from ethypharm sa in order to maintain the exclusivity of our rights  we must achieve minimum annual sales in the us until february or pay amounts to ethypharm to compensate for any shortfall 
in addition  a sales based milestone was met which resulted in the company paying  to ethypharm in the fourth quarter of we recorded this milestone payment as a liability in accordance with purchase accounting 
the license term expires in february and  absent notice of termination by either party  automatically renews for additional two year periods 
under the terms of the agreement  at our option  ethypharm is obligated to either manufacture and deliver to us finished fenofibrate product or deliver api to us for encapsulation and packaging

ramoplanin we have a novel  late stage investigational antibiotic candidate  ramoplanin  under investigation for the treatment of clostridium difficile associated disease  or cdad 
in october  we in licensed ramoplanin from vicuron pharmaceuticals inc vicuron  now a wholly owned subsidiary of pfizer inc  and on february   acquired worldwide rights from vicuron  assuming full rights to the manufacturing  development and commercialization of ramoplanin 
we agreed with the fda to a special protocol assessment spa regarding the specific components of a phase iii program that  if completed successfully  would support regulatory approval for the indication 
with the acquisition of antara  we have made the strategic decision to concentrate our financial resources on building our primary care business in the united states and are currently seeking to out license  co develop or sell our rights to ramoplanin 
critical accounting policies estimates we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k 
our preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our critical accounting policies include the following 
table of contents revenue recognition our principal source of revenue is the sale of factive tablets and antara capsules 
in the second quarter of  we began recognizing co promotion revenue in connection with our co promotion agreement with auxilium pharmaceuticals  inc auxilium  which terminated on august  other historical sources of revenue include biopharmaceutical alliances and royalties from our divested genomic services business 
in future periods  we expect our revenues derived from biopharmaceutical alliances will continue to decrease  however product revenues will continue to increase based on anticipated increased volume of prescriptions of factive tablets and antara capsules 
although antara revenue results are anticipated to be relatively steady throughout our fiscal year  we expect demand for factive to be highest from december to march as the incidence of respiratory tract infections  including cap and aecb  tends to increase during the winter months 
in addition  fluctuations in the severity of the annual respiratory tract infection season may cause our product sales to vary from year to year 
due to these seasonal fluctuations in demand for factive  our results in any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results for any other quarter or for the entire year 
product sales we follow the provisions of staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition a replacement of sab sab no 
and recognize revenue from product sales upon delivery of product to wholesalers  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  title to product and associated risk of loss has passed to the wholesaler and collectability of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
all revenues from product sales are recorded net of applicable allowances for sales returns  rebates  special promotional programs  and discounts 
for arrangements where the risk of loss has not passed to wholesalers or pharmacies  we defer the recognition of revenue by recording deferred revenue until such time that risk of loss has passed 
the cost of factive and antara associated with amounts recorded as deferred revenue is recorded in inventory until such time as risk of loss has passed 
co promotion revenue amounts earned under our previous co promotion agreement with auxilium from the sale of testim gel  a product developed by auxilium  are classified as co promotion revenue in our consolidated statements of operations 
auxilium was obligated to pay us a co promotion fee based on a specified percentage of the gross profit from testim sales attributable to primary care physicians in the us that exceeded specified cumulative sales threshold  determined on an annual basis 
the specific percentage was based upon testim sales levels attributable to primary care physicians and the marketing expenses incurred by us in connection with the promotion of testim under the co promotion agreement 
such co promotion revenue was earned when testim units were dispensed through patient prescriptions 
there is no cost of goods sold associated with co promotion revenue  and the selling and marketing expenses incurred with respect to the co promotion arrangement are classified as selling and marketing expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
on august   we mutually agreed with auxilium to conclude this co promotion arrangement and agreed with auxilium to share profits from primary care sales  as provided for under the co promotion agreement  through august  as part of the termination of the co promotion agreement  we received  from auxilium as additional compensation for commercialization efforts by our sales force through august   which has been recognized as revenue during the year ended december  biopharmaceutical other revenue prior to our merger with genesoft pharmaceuticals  inc in  we pursued biopharmaceutical revenues through alliance partnerships with pharmaceutical companies and through government grants 
biopharmaceutical revenues have consisted of government research grants and license fees  contract research  and milestone 
table of contents payments from alliances with pharmaceutical companies 
we also maintained a genomic services business 
we have now shifted our focus to the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products 
the declining revenues and associated expenses for the genomics services business have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements 
other revenues consist of sublicensing revenues related to factive 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sab no 
and emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf no 

in accordance with eitf no 
 the up front license payments related to various license agreements will be recognized as revenue over the term of our continuing obligations under the arrangements which range from eighteen months to twenty four months 
in addition  on august   we announced that we received notice from pfizer mexico that factive was approved by the ministry of health in mexico to be marketed as factive for the treatment of community acquired pneumonia  acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and acute bacterial sinusitis which generated a milestone payment recognized as revenue during the year ended december  we expense incremental direct costs associated with sublicense agreements in the period in which the expense is incurred 
sales rebates  discounts and incentives in the us  we sell factive and antara to pharmaceutical wholesalers for further distribution through pharmacies to the ultimate consumers of the product 
when we deliver our product  we reduce the amount of gross revenue recognized from such product sales based primarily on estimates of four categories of discounts and allowances that suggest that all or part of the revenue should not be recognized at the time of the delivery product returns  cash discounts  rebates  and special promotional programs 
product returns factors that are considered in our estimate of future factive and antara product returns include an analysis of the amount of product in the wholesaler and pharmacy channel  review of consumer consumption data as reported by external information management companies  return rates for similar competitive antibiotic products that have a similar shelf life and are sold in the same distribution channel  the remaining time to expiration of our product  and our forecast of future sales of our product 
consistent with industry practice  we offer contractual return rights that allow our customers to return product within six months prior to and twelve months subsequent to the expiration date of our product 
factive tablets and antara capsules each have a month expiration period from the date of manufacturing 
at december  and december   our product return reserve was approximately  and  respectively 
this reserve is evaluated on a quarterly basis  assessing each of the factors described above  and adjusted accordingly 
based on the factors noted above  we believe our estimate of product returns is reasonable  and changes  if any  from this estimate would not have a material impact to our financial statements 
cash discounts our standard invoice includes a contractual cash discount  net days terms 
based on historical experience  we estimate that most of our customers deduct a discount from their balance 
the cash discount reserve is presented as an allowance against trade receivables in the consolidated balance sheet 
as of december  and  the balance of the cash discounts reserve was approximately  and  respectively 
rebates the liability for managed care and medicaid rebates is calculated based on historical and current rebate redemption and utilization rates contractually submitted by each state 
as of december  and  the 
table of contents balance of the accrual for managed care and medicaid rebates for antara and factive in total was approximately  and  respectively 
considering the estimates made by us  as well as estimates prepared by third party utilization reports that are used in evaluating the required liability balance  we believe our estimates are reasonable 
as of december   the significant change to our estimates in the periods presented is primarily attributable to the acquisition of the antara product line 
special promotional programs we have from time to time  offered certain promotional incentives to our customers for both factive and antara and may continue this practice in the future 
such programs include sample cards to end consumers  certain product incentives to pharmacy customers  and other sales stocking allowances 
examples of programs utilized to date follow sample card program for factive during the first and second quarters of  we initiated three sample card programs whereby we offered an incentive to patients in the form of a free full course sample card for factive 
we have accounted for these programs in accordance with eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer eitf no 

for the first sample card program  we were able to develop a reasonable and reliable estimate of the amount of expected reimbursement claims based on actual claims submitted by and processed by a third party claims processing organization 
for the second and third sample card programs  the estimate of expected reimbursement claims was based on the historical actual reimbursement claims for the similar completed programs that we conducted in the first and second quarters of the first program expired on march   the second program expired on june  and the third program expired on september  there is no liability as of december  for these sample card programs 
voucher rebate program for factive in  we initiated six voucher rebate programs whereby we offered mail in rebates and point of sale rebates to retail consumers 
we have accounted for these programs in accordance with eitf no 
the liabilities we recorded for these voucher rebate programs were estimated based upon the historical rebate redemption rates for the similar completed programs that commenced in the first quarter of and the fourth quarter of the first program expired on june   the second and third programs expired on august   the fourth program expired on september   the fifth program expired on december  and the sixth program expires on april  as of december  and  the balance of the liabilities for these voucher programs totaled approximately  and  respectively 
voucher rebate program for antara during the third and fourth quarter of  we initiated two voucher rebate programs whereby we offered a point of sale rebate to retail consumers 
we have accounted for this program in accordance with eitf no 
the liabilities we recorded for these voucher rebate programs were estimated based upon the historical rebate redemption rates for the similar completed programs by other pharmaceutical companies 
this first program expired on december  and the second program expires on july  as of december   the balance of the liabilities for these voucher programs totaled approximately  clinical trial expense accrual our clinical development trials related to factive and ramoplanin are primarily performed by outside parties 
at the end of each accounting period  we estimate both the total cost and time period of the trials and the percent completed as of that accounting date 
we also adjust these estimates when final invoices are received 

table of contents for the fiscal years ended december  and  we adjusted our accrual for clinical trial expenditures to reflect its most current estimate of liabilities outstanding to third parties 
however  the possibility exists that the timing or cost of the clinical trials might be longer or shorter and cost more or less than estimated and that the associated financial adjustments would be reflected in future periods 
accounts receivable trade accounts receivable consists of amounts due from wholesalers for the purchase of factive and antara 
ongoing credit evaluations of customers are performed and collateral is generally not required 
as of december  and  we reserved approximately  and  respectively  for bad debts related to the sale of factive or antara 
we continuously review all customer accounts to determine if an allowance for uncollectible accounts is necessary 
we currently provide substantially all of our distributors with payment terms of up to days on purchases of factive and antara 
amounts past due from customers are determined based on contractual payment terms 
through december   payments have generally been made in a timely manner 
we also reserved  and  respectively  as of december  and related to other non trade receivables 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the average cost method 
products are removed from inventory and recognized as cost of goods sold on an average cost basis 
for factive  inventories consist of raw material in powder form and work in process of approximately  and  and factive finished tablets of approximately  and  as of december  and  respectively 
for antara  inventories consist of raw material and work in process of approximately  and antara finished capsules of approximately  as of december  on a quarterly basis  we analyze our inventory levels  and provide a reserve for inventory and marketing samples that have become obsolete  have a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value or are in excess of forecast requirements to cost of product revenues and marketing expense  respectively 
expired inventory is disposed of and the related costs are written off against the previously established reserves 
at december  and december   there was approximately  and  respectively  in factive sample product to be used for factive marketing programs 
at december   there was approximately  in antara samples product to be used for antara marketing programs 
these are classified within other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
long lived assets we follow the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

under sfas no 
 long lived assets and identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if indicators of impairment exist  recoverability of assets to be held and used is assessed by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
recoverability measurement and estimating the undiscounted cash flows are each done at the lowest possible level for which there are identifiable assets 
if the aggregate undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  then the resulting impairment charge to be recorded is calculated based on the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
any write downs are recorded as permanent reductions in the carrying amount of the asset 
we also follow the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas no 

under sfas no 
 goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are reviewed periodically for impairment 
we perform an annual evaluation of goodwill at the end of each fiscal year 
table of contents to test for impairment or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
because we have a single operating segment  which is our sole reporting unit  we perform this test by comparing the fair value of the entity with our book value  including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the book value  goodwill is not impaired 
if the book value exceeds the fair value  then we would calculate the potential impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the book value 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the book value  then an impairment charge would be recorded 
as of december   we do not believe that any of our long lived assets  goodwill  and other intangible assets are impaired

 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
the interpretation 
the interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company has not yet completed its evaluation of the interpretation  but does not currently believe that adoption will have a material impact on its results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
fair value measurements in september  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
fair value measurements sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes a common definition for fair value  creates a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosure requirements about such fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for our first quarter of management is in the process of studying the impact of this interpretation on our financial accounting and reporting 
fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities in february  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas no 

sfas no 
provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
the objective of sfas no 
is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
generally accepted accounting principles have required different measurement attributes for different assets and liabilities that can create artificial volatility in earnings 
fasb has indicated it believes that sfas no 
helps to mitigate this type of accounting induced volatility by enabling companies to report related assets and liabilities at fair value  which would likely reduce the need for companies to comply with detailed rules for hedge accounting 
sfas no 
also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
for example  sfas no 
requires companies to provide additional information that will help investors and other users of financial statements to more easily understand the effect of the 
table of contents company s choice to use fair value on its earnings 
it also requires entities to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet 
sfas no 
does not eliminate disclosure requirements included in other accounting standards  including requirements for disclosures about fair value measurements included in fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
 and fasb statement no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments sfas no 

sfas no 
is effective as of the beginning of a company s first fiscal year beginning after november  early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of the previous fiscal year provided that the company makes that choice in the first days of that fiscal year and also elects to apply the provisions of sfas no
