item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview the company s results of operations depend primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on its loan and securities portfolios and its cost of funds  consisting of the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
results of operations are also affected by the company s provision for loan losses  income and expenses pertaining to other real estate owned  gains and losses from sales of loans and securities and non interest income and expenses 
non interest expenses consist principally of compensation and employee benefits  occupancy  data processing  amortization of acquisition related intangible assets  marketing  professional services and other operating expenses 
results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions and changes in interest rates as well as government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
future changes in applicable laws  regulations or government policies may materially affect the company 
the company has taken steps to grow in size and geographic reach and expects to be able to expand its deposit gathering activities with the development of new products and services and improve its overall competitive position and support internal growth through lending in the communities it serves 
the company s growth objectives also include merger and acquisition activities  where appropriate 
completed acquisitions as of december  are connecticut bancshares  alliance  trust company and cornerstone 
the acquisitions of connecticut bancshares and alliance were completed in conjunction with the bank s conversion from mutual to capital stock form on april  the acquisitions of trust company and cornerstone were completed on july  and january   respectively 
westbank was acquired on january  critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies upon which our financial condition depends  and which involve the most complex subjective decisions or assessment  are as follows 
additional information related to the company s accounting policies can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses arriving at an appropriate level of allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of judgment 
the allowance for loan losses provides for probable losses based upon evaluations of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
management uses historical information as well as current economic data  to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses as it is affected by changing economic conditions and various external factors  which may impact the portfolio in ways currently unforeseen 
income taxes management considers accounting for income taxes as a critical accounting policy due to the subjective nature of certain estimates that are involved in the calculation 
management uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the company s assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future income tax returns  for which a financial statement tax benefit has already been recognized 
the realization of the net deferred tax asset generally depends upon future levels of taxable income and the existence of prior years taxable income  to which carry back refund claims could be made 
valuation allowances are established against those deferred tax assets determined not likely to be realized 
management must assess the realizability of the deferred tax asset  including the carryforward of a portion of the charitable contribution  and to the extent that management believes that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance is established 
adjustments to increase or decrease the valuation allowance are generally charged or credited  respectively  to income tax expense 
however  certain changes could be charged or credited to equity or goodwill 
deferred tax liabilities represent items that will require a future tax payment 
they generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred  or a deduction taken on our tax return but not yet recognized as an expense in our financial statements 
deferred tax liabilities are also recognized for certain non cash items such as certain acquired intangible assets subject to amortization which results in a future financial statement expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes 
for more information about income taxes  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this report 
pension and other postretirement benefits the determination of the company s obligation and expense for pension and other postretirement benefits is dependent upon certain assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
key assumptions used in the actuarial valuations include the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation 
actual results could differ from the assumptions and market driven rates may fluctuate 
significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in the assumptions may materially affect future pension and other postretirement obligations and expense 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
intangible assets the company is required to follow sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets for business acquisitions and the subsequent accounting for intangible assets acquired 
for business acquisitions  sfas no 
requires us to record as assets on our financial statements both goodwill  an intangible asset which is equal to the excess of the purchase price which we pay for another company over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired  and identifiable intangible assets such as core deposit intangibles and non compete agreements 
under sfas no 
 goodwill must be regularly evaluated for impairment  in which case we may be required to reduce its carrying value through a charge to earnings 
core deposit and other identifiable intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not have future economic benefit 
the valuation techniques used by management to determine the carrying value of tangible and intangible assets acquired in the acquisitions and the estimated lives of identifiable intangible assets involve estimates for discount rates  projected future cash flows and time period calculations  all of which are susceptible to change based on changes in economic conditions and other factors 
future events or changes in the estimates  which were used to determine the carrying value of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets or which otherwise adversely affects their value or estimated lives could have a material adverse impact on future results of operations

further information regarding earnings per share can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
earnings summary as shown in table  for the year ended december   net income was million  a decrease of million from the comparative period in this decrease is primarily a result of higher operating expenses and conversion and merger related charges coupled with a decline in net interest income  partially offset by an increase in non interest income and a decrease in income tax expense 
higher operating expenses are largely due to the acquisitions of trust company and cornerstone in the areas of salaries and employee benefits and occupancy expenses 
additionally  charges in associated with the implementation of sfas no 
r  share based payment  for options which were granted under the company s long term compensation plan ltcp and executive severance benefits paid were also significant factors in the increase of salaries and employee benefits 
conversion and merger related charges were primarily due to the trust company and cornerstone acquisitions and the commencement of charges related to the westbank acquisition that occurred on january  net interest income declined as the average balance of interest bearing liabilities outpaced the growth rate in the average balance of interest earning assets 
the average rate paid on all interest bearing liabilities increased more than the average yield on all interest earning assets 
combined  these caused a decrease of basis points in the interest rate spread which was primarily driven by the increase in the average rate paid on time deposits of basis points 
non interest income increased primarily due to depositor service charges  an increase in net gains on limited partnerships as a result of a cumulative adjustment due to a change from the cost to equity method of accounting on investments in four limited partnerships  an increase in trust fees as a result of the trust company acquisition  an increase in bank owned life insurance income and gains recorded on the sale of small business administration sba loans 
net income increased by million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in earnings was primarily a result of higher net interest income and non interest income  lower conversion and merger charges related to the connecticut bancshares and alliance acquisitions completed on april  and the contribution in to the foundation  partially offset by increased operating and income tax expenses 
the rise in net interest income was driven primarily by an increase in average net interest earning assets of million resulting from the acquisitions of connecticut bancshares and alliance and growth in the loan and investment securities portfolios subsequent to these acquisitions 
higher non interest income and non interest expenses were predominantly due to the acquisitions  costs associated with being a public company and expenses related to the implementation of the ltcp in june of the contribution of company stock to the foundation was a one time event 
due to an increase in market interest rates  the average yield earned increased for all categories of interest earning assets and the average rate paid increased in virtually all categories of interest bearing liabilities 
the average rate paid on the total of all interest bearing liabilities increased more than the increase in the average yield earned on the total of all interest earning assets  causing a decrease of basis points in the interest rate spread for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  however  this interest rate spread decrease did not lead to a decline in net interest income as the decrease in spread was mitigated by the increase in the net interest earning assets average balance of million primarily as a result of the acquisitions of connecticut bancshares and alliance in april of overall  net interest income increased million 
non interest income increased due to the acquisitions of connecticut bancshares and alliance in and trust company in and income resulting from non recurring transactions 
these increases were partially offset by increases in salaries and benefits resulting from the acquisitions and the implementation of the ltcp 
average balances  interest and average yields cost table below sets forth certain information concerning average interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and their associated yields or rates for the periods indicated 
the average yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expenses by the average balances of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities  respectively  for the periods shown and reflect annualized yields and costs 
average balances are computed using daily balances 
yields and amounts earned include loan fees and fair value adjustments related to acquired loans 
loans held for sale and nonaccrual loans have been included in interest earning assets for purposes of these computations

net interest margin is the difference between the income on earning assets and the cost of interest bearing funds as a percentage of earning assets 
as shown in table  net interest income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the same period in this decrease of million is primarily due to the decline in the interest rate spread of basis points which is being driven by the increases in the average rate paid and the average balance of time deposits 
the average rate paid and average balance of time deposits has increased basis points and million  respectively  since a year ago and reflects both the increase in general market interest rates as well as continuing to offer promotional rates on these deposits to maintain market share 
the increase in the interest rate environment also had a positive effect on the average yield of total interest earning assets  increasing basis points to from 
even though there has been a million increase in the average balances of interest earning assets due to the acquisition of cornerstone at the beginning of and growth in the loan portfolio  it has been outpaced by the increase in the average balances of interest bearing liabilities mainly as a result of share buybacks  additional borrowings to fund loan growth and the purchase of bank owned life insurance  and to a lesser extent  the net increase in deposit balances 
downward pressure on the net interest margin of basis points was the resulting effect of this decline in net interest earning assets of million when coupled with the increase of basis points in the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
throughout  the net interest margin was also compressed by a reduction in the profitability of new loans and deposits  as competitive pressures reduced the profit margin on new business 
the trend is expected to continue in interest income for the twelve months ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase in interest income was driven primarily by loans due to both an increase in the average balances of million and a basis point increase in the average yield earned 
while all loan categories experienced increases in average balances and average yields  the commercial and residential real estate loan portfolios were the drivers of growth 
the increase in average balances was due to the acquisition of cornerstone  the company s continued strategy of purchasing residential mortgages in the secondary market and increased organic loan originations 
the increase in average loan balances accounted for approximately million of the increase in interest income 
the remainder of the increase in interest income was due to increases in market interest rates of basis points on the loan portfolio and basis points on investment securities 
the cost of funds for the year ended december  increased million  or to million compared to the prior year period 
the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased basis points to from 
the increase in interest expense was primarily due to expenses of time deposits and fhlb advances of million 
the increase in time deposits interest expense was the result of a basis point increase in the average rate coupled with an average balance increase of million due to market interest rate increases and offering promotional rates to customers who either had or established a checking relationship with the bank 
increasing market interest rates and checking and savings promotions were the primary factors for the higher interest expense in the other deposit categories  but was partially offset by a decline in the average balances of money market and savings deposits as monies shifted to higher paying time deposits or were lost to competitors 
the increase in interest expense on fhlb advances was predominantly due to an increase in the average balance of million which was used to fund the purchase of residential mortgages  bank owned life insurance  held to maturity investment securities and to a lesser extent helped fund the company s stock buy back program 
there was also a basis point increase in the average rate paid on these borrowings due to increases in market interest rates 
net interest income was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to the prior year 
increases in average interest bearing liabilities were primarily driven by the acquisitions of connecticut bancshares and alliance  the conversion from a mutual savings bank to a stock bank and general increases in loans  investment securities  borrowings and time deposits during the period 
interest and dividend income increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the average rate on earning assets increased basis points to from in the prior period 
investment income increased million  mainly due to an increase in mortgage backed securities income of million due to a basis point increase in the average rate earned and an increase in the average balance of million on these securities 
several factors contributed to the increase in investment income including a the movement of short term investments into higher yielding mortgage backed securities during the second quarter of  b the acquisitions of connecticut bancshares and alliance in the second quarter of  c additional purchases during  and d a rising market interest rate environment 
income from loans increased million of which million related to increases in average loan balances of million  primarily attributable to the acquisitions of connecticut bancshares and alliance during the second quarter of  as well as higher originations and loan purchases and million was due to an increase of basis points in the average rate earned on these loans resulting from the general increase in market interest rates during the period 
the cost of funds for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million in the prior year period 
the average rate on interest bearing liabilities increased basis points to from 
interest expense on deposits increased million and was mainly driven by a basis point increase in the average rate paid on time deposits and a million increase in the average balance of time deposits 
the increase was due to market interest rate increases as well as the company s strategy of offering promotional rates to customers who either had or established a checking relationship with the bank 
interest expense on fhlb advances and other borrowings increased million over the prior year period to million from million 
this increase was primarily due to an increase of million in the average balance of fhlb advances in order for the company to originate and purchase residential mortgages  purchase investment securities and to fund its stock buy back program while taking advantage of special borrowing programs and products currently being offered by the fhlb 
rate volume analysis the following table presents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected the company s interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated 
information is provided in each category with respect to i changes attributable to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior rate  ii changes attributable to changes in rate changes in rate multiplied by prior volume  and iii the net change 
the changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate

management performs a monthly review of the loan portfolio  and based on this review determines the level of the provision necessary to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses allowance 
management recorded a provision for loan losses of  for the year ended december  the allowance was deemed adequate despite not fully providing for the total year to date net charge offs of approximately  although asset quality remains strong  there has been a slight increase in the ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets and nonperforming loans to total loans  while the allowance for loan losses as a percent of nonperforming loans has decreased 
however  net charge offs as a percentage of the total allowance has improved to for the year ended december  from and for the years ended december  and respectively 
this compares to a provision for loan losses of  and  recorded for the years ended december  and  respectively 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  which represented of nonperforming loans and 
of total loans 
in comparison  the allowance for loan losses was million at december  representing of nonperforming loans and of total loans 
the allowance acquired in the cornerstone acquisition was million 
the reduction in the ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans reflects growth in lower risk loan portfolios and acceptable asset quality measures

the principal categories of non interest income are shown in table for the twelve months ended december   non interest income increased million to million from million for the twelve months ended december  the company had significant year to date increases in depositor service charges  net gain on securities and limited partnerships  trust fees and boli 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in other income  loan and servicing income  and investment and insurance fees 
the increase in depositor service charges is mainly the result of increases in overdraft fees on demand deposit accounts due to the increase in the number of overdraft transactions resulting in part to the implementation of a check card overdraft program during the second quarter of  additional volume from the accounts acquired from cornerstone bank and an increase in the per item fee 
the increase in the net gain on securities and limited partnerships was due to implementing the equity method of accounting relating to four investments in limited partnerships which resulted in a cumulative adjustment of million 
trust fees increased due to the acquisition of trust company in july the increase in boli income is due to income generated on the additional assets from the purchase of million of life insurance coverage during the third quarter and the amount acquired from cornerstone of million as well as an increase in the average yield earned 
net gain on sale of loans has increased primarily due to the company s strategy of selling the guaranteed portion of sba loans that meet certain criteria  a result of the cornerstone acquisition as cornerstone was already an active participant in the secondary sba market 
other income decreased due to non recurring income received in the prior year primarily relating to gains on two lease terminations  the sale of excess real estate  income tax refunds  and income received in the prior year related to the sale of a portion of the merchant services book of business that was greater than the income received on a similar sale in the fourth quarter of loan and servicing income decreased in part due to a larger write up of previously recorded impairment in the valuation of the mortgage servicing assets during the year ended december  compared to the same period in investment and insurance fees decreased due to the unfavorable market for fixed annuity insurance products 
non interest income increased million for the year ended december  from the comparable period in  primarily due to the acquisitions of connecticut bancshares and alliance in  the resulting expansion of our market and branch network and the acquisition of trust company on july   which more than doubled the company s trust assets under management to billion 
the acquisitions were the main reasons for increases in investment and insurance fees  bank owned life insurance and trust fees 
depositor service charges increased due to new product and service initiatives implemented during as well as the acquisitions of connecticut bancshares and alliance 
loan and servicing income increased  due to a reduction in the valuation allowance on mortgage servicing rights  partially offset by a net decrease in loan fees  principally commercial real estate loan prepayment fees as the prepayment penalty period had expired on many of the loans that prepaid in the increase in other income was largely attributable to several items of a non recurring nature  including interest on income tax refunds  gains on two lease terminations  sales of excess real estate  and a gain on the sale of a portion of the merchant services book of business 
however  approximately  of the increase in other income is recurring and was due to an increase in amounts earned on the outstanding balances of bank checks processed by a third party vendor  which is also due to the acquisition of connecticut bancshares in table non interest expense change year ended december  dollars in thousands amount percent amount percent salaries and employee benefits    occupancy     furniture and fixtures    outside services     advertising  public relations and sponsorships   contribution to the foundation  amortization of identifiable intangible assets   conversion and merger related charges   other    total non interest expense non interest expense analysis non interest expense increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the main driver of this increase is salaries and employee benefits 
other increases include occupancy  conversion and merger related charges and advertising  public relations and sponsorships 
the majority of the increase in salaries and employee benefits is due to the additional employees as a result of the acquisitions of cornerstone bank and trust company that occurred january  and july   respectively  severance that was recorded for an executive who left the company and expenses associated with the ltcp that was implemented in june the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r as of january  and upon adoption  the company began expensing stock options that were awarded under the ltcp 
these increases in salaries were partially offset by decreases in pension and bonus expenses 
the decrease in bonus expense was mainly the result of a modification to the company s performance incentive plan and the decrease in pension expense was primarily due to the company s cash contribution to the qualified pension plan in the amount of million 
the increase in occupancy expenses was mainly due to the increased branch network resulting from the acquisition of cornerstone 
conversion and merger related charges increased mostly due to consulting and data processing expenses related to cornerstone for system conversions  the onset of expenses related to the westbank acquisition that occurred january  and legal and consulting expenses related to a potential plan of merger that was abandoned during the due diligence phase in the first quarter of additional conversion and merger related charges resulting from the westbank acquisition will continue into advertising expenses  largely newspaper  radio and direct mail campaigns which correlated with the company s deployment of various deposit and loan product promotions accounted for much of the increase in advertising  public relations and sponsorships 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in amortization of identifiable intangible assets and outside services 
the decrease in the amortization of identifiable intangible assets was due to fewer non compete agreements remaining in as they began to expire in the non compete agreements are being amortized on a straight line basis over the terms of each agreement 
additionally  the company experienced a slight reduction of amortization on core deposit intangibles  due to the company utilizing an accelerated method which calls for a higher level of expense in earlier periods relating to the connecticut bancshares and alliance acquisitions  partially offset by new amortization of a core deposit intangible recorded in conjunction with the cornerstone acquisition 
the net decrease in outside services for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was comprised of various components including reductions in i consulting relating to sarbanes oxley sox  the ltcp and systems projects  and ii a reduction in data processing fees due to a new contract extension  partially offset by increases due to iii additional transactional volume related to the acquisitions and iv outsourced internal audit services 
other expense also decreased and was largely due to a reduction in the company s operating insurance premiums 
expenses for the year ended december  decreased significantly over the comparable period in  principally due to the million contribution to the foundation and million in conversion and merger related charges recorded in as compared with million during in april  the company announced two then pending acquisitions  the trust company  which was completed on july  and cornerstone  which closed on january  excluding the contribution to the foundation and conversion and merger related charges  non interest expense increased million with almost every expense category rising 
these increases are primarily attributable to the ltcp which was implemented in and additional operating expenses resulting from the acquisitions and the conversion to a public company 
the conversion to a stock bank and the simultaneous acquisitions of connecticut bancshares and alliance occurred on april  therefore  expenses include twelve months of the combined banks  whereas expenses include only nine months of the combined banks 
additionally  the acquisition of trust company occurred on july  and has contributed to the increase in current year expenses 
salaries and employee benefits increased million primarily due to increases related to the ltcp  increased salaries resulting from the trust company acquisition and higher expenses for medical insurance  pension and employee stock ownership plan esop costs 
esop costs increased due to the three additional months as well as an increase of approximately for medical insurance year over year and a decrease in the discount rate used by the company to calculate net periodic benefit cost 
occupancy expense increased primarily due to the acquisitions and the opening of a new branch in september of outside services increased million due to increases in audit and data processing fees  partially offset by a decrease in consultant fees 
data processing fees increased due to the increased transactional volume and core system usage related to the outsourcing of certain processing functions of connecticut bancshares and as a result of new processing fees incurred relating to trust company 
audit fees increased due in part to additional benefit plan audits of the acquired banks and sox testing fees 
consultant fees decreased due to costs incurred in the prior year for the completion of a strategic business plan  partially offset by current year costs relating to sox compliance 
advertising increased due to the company s expanded market area 
other expense increased million due to increases in general operating expenses primarily due to the acquisitions 
income tax expense income tax expense for the year ended december  was million and resulted in an effective tax rate of 
income tax expense was million for the year ended december   which resulted in an effective tax rate of and was  for the year ended december   which resulted in an effective tax rate of 
the change in the effective tax rate for the year ended december  in comparison to the year ended december  was primarily due to the additional bank owned life insurance purchased in and due to the decrease in the valuation allowance required for capital assets 
absent the impact that the charitable contribution to the foundation had on the effective tax rate as of december   the effective tax rate would have been 
the change in the effective tax rate for the year ended december  in comparison to the year ended december  was primarily due to excess remuneration pursuant to internal revenue code m and to the increase in the valuation allowance required for the charitable contribution to the foundation 
comparison of financial condition at december  and december  financial condition summary from december  to december   total assets and liabilities increased approximately million and million  respectively  due mainly to increases in loans and borrowings 
of the total increases  approximately million of assets and approximately million of liabilities are attributable to the cornerstone acquisition 
stockholders equity increased million to billion due primarily to stock issued to acquire cornerstone and year to date net income  partially offset by treasury shares acquired and dividends

residential real estate loans continue to represent the largest segment of the company s loan portfolio as of december   comprising fifty percent of total loans 
the increase of million is due to loan portfolio purchases  organic originations and balances acquired from cornerstone  partially offset by principal loan payments 
the purchased portfolio includes adjustable rate and and year fixed rate residential real estate loans with property locations throughout the united states  with the largest concentration in the northeast 
for  loan purchases accounted for million of the year to date increase in residential real estate loans and were primarily purchased with cash flows from the available for sale investment portfolio and funds borrowed from the fhlb 
the loan purchase program will continue to be a focus for the company in the coming year 
the acquisition of cornerstone added approximately million in residential loans 
commercial real estate loans increased million from december  to december  the increase was attributable to the acquisition of cornerstone which added approximately million to the portfolio as well as increases in both the number and average balance of organic loan originations partially as a result of the company s competitive position in the connecticut commercial real estate lending market subsequent to the acquisitions of cornerstone  connecticut bancshares and alliance 
commercial business loans increased million to million at december   primarily due to million acquired through the cornerstone acquisition and loan originations partially offset by payoffs  loan maturities and sales of the guaranteed portion of sba loans that met certain criteria 
although there were significant commercial loan originations during  approximately were for lines of credit and the impact on actual balances will not be realized unless the lines are drawn upon 
at december  the utilization percentage for these originations was approximately 
the company s continued strategy is to build a larger percentage of the company s assets in commercial loans including real estate  construction and other commercial loans 
to accomplish this goal  the company is expanding penetration of its geographical target area as well as promoting stronger business development efforts to obtain new business banking relationships  while maintaining strong credit quality 
with the january  acquisition of westbank  a commercial bank and trust company  located in western massachusetts  the company s geographical area and competitive position has been significantly enhanced and will be a catalyst for additional growth 
home equity loans and lines of credit increased million from december  to december   with cornerstone contributing approximately million of the increase 
these products were promoted by the company through competitive pricing and marketing campaigns including the minute loan and prime pricing  as the company is committed to growing this loan segment while maintaining credit quality as a higher yielding alternative to investments

estimated fair value usually represents the sales price a buyer would be willing to pay on the basis of current market conditions  including normal loan terms from other financial institutions  less the estimated costs to sell the property 
management inspects all other real estate owned properties periodically 
subsequent writedowns in the carrying value of other real estate owned are charged to expense if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value 
at december   the company did not have other real estate owned 
classification of assets and loan review an internal risk rating system is used to monitor and evaluate the credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio 
under our internal risk rating system  we currently classify problem and potential problem assets as substandard  doubtful or loss 
an independent third party conducts loan reviews of all loan portfolios 
on a quarterly basis  a criticized asset committee composed of the chief credit officer  executive vice president of business banking and other senior officers meet to review criticized asset reports on commercial and commercial real estate loans that are risk rated special mention  substandard  or doubtful 
the reports focus on the current status  strategy  financial data  and appropriate risk rating of the criticized loan 
at december   loans classified as substandard both accruing and nonaccruing totaled million  and consisted of million in commercial real estate loans and million in commercial loans 
special mention loans totaled million  and consisted of million of commercial real estate loans and million of commercial loans 
there were no loans classified as doubtful at december  allowance for loan losses the board of directors and management of the company are committed to the establishment and maintenance of an adequate allowance for loan losses  determined in accordance with gaap 
our approach is to follow the most recent guidelines that have been provided by our regulators 
management believes that the methodology it employs to develop  monitor and support the allowance for loan losses is consistent with those guidelines 
while management believes that it has established adequate specific and general allowances for probable losses on loans  there can be no assurance that the regulators  in reviewing the company s loan portfolio  will not request an increase in the allowance for losses  thereby negatively affecting the company s financial condition and earnings 
moreover  actual losses may be dependent upon future events and  as such  further additions to the allowance for loan losses may become necessary 
the allowance for loan losses is established through provisions for loan losses based on management s on going evaluation of the risks inherent in the company s loan portfolio 
charge offs against the allowance for loan losses are taken on loans when it is determined that the collection of loan principal is unlikely 
recoveries made on loans that have been charged off are credited to the allowance for loan losses

as a result of the net charge offs for the year ended december   a provision for loan losses of  was recorded 
this compares to net charge offs of million and a provision of  for the year ended december  management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate based on the bank s satisfactory net loss experience  sound asset quality and non accrual indicators  and partially offset by a softening in the real estate market 
the company had an allowance of million and million at december  and december   respectively

management follows a guiding principle that the level of the allowance for loan losses should be directionally consistent with asset quality indicators 
the allowance is computed by segregating the portfolio into pools of loans that have similar loan product type and risk rating characteristics 
management uses historical default and loss rates  internal risk ratings  industry data  peer comparisons  and other risk based characteristics 
the data is then analyzed and estimates of losses inherent in the portfolio are determined using formula allowances for homogeneous pools of loans and criticized loans  and specific allowances for impaired loans 
the provision and allowance for loan losses are then reviewed and approved by the company s board of directors on a quarterly basis 
investment securities the company maintains an investment securities portfolio that is primarily structured to provide a source of liquidity for operating needs  to generate interest income and to provide a means to balance interest rate sensitivity 
the securities portfolio is managed in accordance with regulatory guidelines and established internal corporate investment policies

this is an increase of million from billion at december  the increase was primarily the result of purchases of held to maturity mortgage backed securities that were duration match funded against fhlb borrowings  partially offset by a decrease in the available for sale portfolio 
principal payments were used to purchase residential real estate loans as well as to offset any deposit outflow 
over the past year  the company has emphasized the purchase of  and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage securities  ten year mortgage backed securities and agency collateralized mortgage obligations with underlying collateral consisting of fifteen year mortgage loans 
in addition  the company has targeted collateralized mortgage obligation purchases in the two to three year weighted average life tranches with expected extensions up to a maximum of five and one half years in a rising rate environment 
the objective of this decision has been to limit the potential interest rate risk due to the extension of this portfolio in a rising rate environment 
the structures of the collateralized mortgage obligations have been in a planned amortization class  mandatory redemption or tightly structured sequential pay format

the company does not currently maintain a portfolio of trading securities 
as of december   billion  or of the portfolio  was classified as available for sale and million of the portfolio was classified as held to maturity 
the net unrealized loss on securities classified as available for sale as of december  was million compared to an unrealized loss of million as of december  the increase in the fair value of securities available for sale was primarily due to fluctuations in market interest rates during the period 
management has performed a review of all investments with unrealized losses and noted that none of these investments had other than temporary impairment

increases in the cash surrender value of the policies  as well as insurance proceeds received  are recorded in non interest income and are not subject to income tax 
intangible assets at december   the company had intangible assets of million  an increase of million  or  from million at december  the increase was predominately due to the acquisition of cornerstone on january  which resulted in the company recording additional goodwill of million and a core deposit intangible of million  partially offset by year to date amortization expense of million 
also  in accordance with the definitive agreement the company previously entered into with trust company  additional merger consideration in the form of company stock and cash was remitted to trust company shareholders in the first quarter of  which resulted in the company recording an additional million of goodwill

management assesses the recoverability of intangible assets subject to amortization whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
if the carrying amount exceeds fair value an impairment charge is recorded to income 
goodwill is not amortized  but instead is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis 
the company performs its annual test for goodwill impairment during the first quarter of the year on its two reporting units  newalliance bank and the trust department  and no impairment was recorded 
an additional impairment test for the trust department was performed in september and no impairment was recorded 
no events or circumstances subsequent to those evaluations indicate that the carrying value of the company s goodwill may not be recoverable 
other assets the company s other assets increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  this net increase was primarily due to an increase in prepaid expenses for a million cash prepayment for the westbank acquisition which closed on january   partially offset by a decrease of million in the prepaid pension asset in order to reflect the funded status of the company s defined benefit plan in accordance sfas no

newalliance also established a promotional free savings account available to customers who either have or establish a checking account with the company 
as a result of these promotions  the company was able to attract new retail and business customers as well as offering attractive products to existing customers 
now accounts increased by million due in part to the free interest checking product 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in organic deposit balances mostly in money market and demand deposits  much of which is due to the competitive market environment and shifting to higher yielding products

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of market and interest rate risk general market risk is the exposure to losses resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the company has no foreign currency or commodity price risk 
credit risk related to investment securities is low as substantially all are investment grade or have government guarantees 
the chief market risk factor affecting financial condition and operating results is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the exposure of current and future earnings and capital arising from adverse movements in interest rates 
this risk is managed by periodic evaluation of the interest rate risk inherent in certain balance sheet accounts  determination of the level of risk considered appropriate given the company s capital and liquidity requirements  business strategy  performance objectives and operating environment and maintenance of such risks within guidelines approved by the board of directors 
through such management  the company seeks to reduce the vulnerability of its net earnings to changes in interest rates 
the asset liability committee  comprised of several senior executives  is responsible for managing interest rate risk 
on a quarterly basis  the board of directors reviews the company s gap position and interest rate sensitivity exposure described below and asset liability committee minutes detailing the company s activities and strategies  the effect of those strategies on the company s operating results  interest rate risk position and the effect changes in interest rates would have on the company s net interest income 
the extent of movement of interest rates is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on earnings 
the principal strategies used to manage interest rate risk include i emphasizing the origination  purchase and retention of adjustable rate loans  and the origination and purchase of loans with maturities matched with those of the deposits and borrowings funding the loans  ii investing in debt securities with relatively short maturities and or average lives and iii classifying a significant portion of its investment portfolio as available for sale so as to provide sufficient flexibility in liquidity management 
the company employs two approaches to interest rate risk measurement  gap analysis and income simulation analysis 
gap analysis the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring a bank s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is deemed to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
at december   the company s cumulative one year interest rate gap which is the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year  was negative million  or negative of total assets 
the bank s approved policy limit is plus or minus 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
the following table sets forth the company s cumulative maturity distribution of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december   interest rate sensitivity gap  cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap  cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ratio  and cumulative interest earning assets as a percentage of cumulative interest bearing liabilities ratio 
this table indicates the time periods in which interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities will mature or may reprice in accordance with their contractual terms 
assumptions are made on the rate of prepayment of principal on loans and investment securities 
however  this table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the company s net interest yield because the repricing of various categories of assets and liabilities is discretionary and is subject to competitive and other pressures 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of changes in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in the gap analysis 
as a result  various assets and liabilities indicated as repricing within the same time period may  in fact  reprice at different times and at different rate levels 
it should also be noted that this table reflects certain assumptions regarding the categorization of assets and liabilities and represents a one day position  in fact  variations occur daily as management adjusts interest rate sensitivity throughout the year 
interest rate sensitivity gap december  dollars in thousands months months months years years total interest earning assets investment securities loans short term investments total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities savings deposits now deposits money market deposits time deposits fhlb advances and other borrowings total interest bearing liabilities interest rate sensitivity gap    cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap   cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ratio cumulative interest earning assets as a percentage of cumulative interest bearing liabilities income simulation analysis income simulation analysis considers the maturity and repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities  as well as the relative sensitivities of these balance sheet components over a range of interest rate scenarios 
tested scenarios include instantaneous rate shocks  rate ramps over a six month or one year period  static rates  non parallel shifts in the yield curve and a forward rate scenario 
the simulation analysis is used to measure the exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates over a specified time horizon  usually a three year period 
simulation analysis involves projecting future balance sheet structure and interest income and expense under the various rate scenarios 
the company s internal guidelines on interest rate risk specify that for all interest rate scenarios  the estimated net interest margin over the next months should decline by less than as compared to the forecasted net interest margin in the base case scenario 
however  in practice  interest rate risk is managed well within these guidelines 
for the base case rate scenario the flat yield curve as of december  was utilized 
this interest rate scenario most closely approximates management s expectations for interest rate movements over the next twelve months 
as of december   the company s estimated exposure as a percentage of estimated net interest margin for the next twelve month period as compared to the forecasted net interest margin in the base case scenario are as follows percentage change in estimated net interest margin over twelve months basis point instantaneous and sustained increase in rates basis point instantaneous and sustained decrease in rates in the current rate environment  an instantaneous and sustained downward rate shock of basis points is a realistic representation of the potential risk facing the company due to declining rates 
for an increase in rates  a basis points instantaneous and sustained rate shock is also a relevant representation of potential risk given the current rate structure and the current state of the economy 
based on the scenarios above  net interest income would increase slightly in the month period after an immediate decrease in rates  and would decrease slightly after an immediate increase in rates 
computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on a number of assumptions including the level of market interest rates  the degree to which certain assets and liabilities with similar maturities or periods to repricing react to changes in market interest rates  the degree to which non maturity deposits react to changes in market rates  the expected prepayment rates on loans and investments  the degree to which early withdrawals occur on time deposits and other deposit flows 
as a result  these computations should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not reflect any actions that management may undertake in response to changes in interest rates
