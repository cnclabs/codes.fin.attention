risk factors 
overview of the advertising environment for was slightly ahead of the rab has reported that radio revenue growth for was up approximately from the prior year due to growth in both local and national markets 
nevertheless  for  our revenue performance outpaced the industry with total pro forma net revenues increasing see the explanation of how we calculated our pro forma results and a reconciliation of pro forma results to our historical results under results of operations 
our local and other revenue stream has remained consistently strong  with pro forma local net revenue growing 
we attribute this strength to our previous investments in our local sales forces and the strong ratings and revenue share positions we enjoy in most of our markets 
the consistent success on the local revenue side of our business  was mirrored in by growth in national revenue 
for  our pro forma net national revenues were up versus the prior year 
in may  we switched national sales representation firms to katz media group 
since the switch  we have already seen improvements in our national revenue stream  attributable to the systems and resources employed by katz 
we believe that as our relationship with katz continues  we will be able to achieve greater improvement in our national revenue stream 
our management team remains focused on our strategy of pursuing growth through acquisition 
however  acquisitions are closely evaluated to ensure that they will generate stockholder value and our management is committed to completing only those acquisitions that we believe will increase our share price 
the compression of publicly traded radio broadcast company multiples in  combined with a market for privately held radio stations that did not see a corresponding multiples compression  translated to minimal acquisition activity for us in given the lack of suitable acquisition opportunities  in and  our board authorized us to purchase an aggregate of million in shares of our class a common stock  within the limits set forth under our credit agreement and over a time frame that will mitigate any factors that would otherwise increase our leverage levels 
in addition  in we completed a board approved recapitalization that included a modified dutch auction tender offer for million shares of our outstanding class a common stock and a related purchase of million shares of our outstanding class b common stock 
in june  we secured a new million credit facility that increased our borrowing capacity  lowered our effective interest rate and increased our overall flexibility with respect to potential acquisitions or share repurchases 
as of december   our average cost of debt  including the effects of our derivative positions  was 
we remain committed to maintaining manageable debt levels  which will continue to improve our ability to generate cash flow from operations 
our business we engage in the acquisition  operation  and development of commercial radio stations in mid size radio markets in the united states 
in addition  we  along with three private equity firms  formed cumulus media partners  llc cmp  which acquired the radio broadcasting business of susquehanna pfaltzgraff co 
susquehanna in may the acquisition included radio stations in markets 
as a result of our investment in 
table of contents cmp and the acquisition of susquehanna s radio operations  we are the second largest radio broadcasting company in the united states based on number of stations and believe we are the third largest radio broadcasting company based on net revenues 
as of december   directly and through our investment in cmp  we owned or operated stations in us markets and provided sales and marketing services under local marketing  management and consulting agreements pending fcc approval of acquisition to one additional station 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations includes the results of acquisitions and local marketing  management and consulting agreements 
advertising revenue and station operating income our primary source of revenues is the sale of advertising time on our radio stations 
our sales of advertising time are primarily affected by the demand for advertising time from local  regional and national advertisers and the advertising rates charged by our radio stations 
advertising demand and rates are based primarily on a station s ability to attract audiences in the demographic groups targeted by its advertisers  as measured principally by arbitron on a periodic basis  generally two or four times per year 
because audience ratings in local markets are crucial to a station s financial success  we endeavor to develop strong listener loyalty 
we believe that the diversification of formats on our stations helps to insulate them from the effects of changes in the musical tastes of the public with respect to any particular format 
the number of advertisements that can be broadcast without jeopardizing listening levels and the resulting ratings is limited in part by the format of a particular station 
our stations strive to maximize revenue by managing their on air inventory of advertising time and adjusting prices based upon local market conditions 
in the broadcasting industry  radio stations sometimes utilize trade or barter agreements that exchange advertising time for goods or services such as travel or lodging  instead of for cash 
trade revenue totaled million in  million in  and in our use of trade agreements resulted in immaterial operating income expense during the years ended december   and of 
million  million and million  respectively 
we continually seek to minimize our use of trade agreements 
our advertising contracts are generally short term 
we generate most of our revenue from local and regional advertising  which is sold primarily by a station s sales staff 
during the years ended december   and approximately  and  respectively  of our revenues were from local advertising 
our revenues vary throughout the year 
as is typical in the radio broadcasting industry  we expect our first calendar quarter will produce the lowest revenues for the year  and the second and fourth calendar quarters will generally produce the highest revenues for the year  with the exception of certain of our stations  such as those in myrtle beach  south carolina  where the stations generally earn higher revenues in the second and third quarters of the year because of the higher seasonal population in those communities 
our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that typically do not have an effect on revenue generation until future periods  if at all 
our most significant station operating expenses are employee salaries and commissions  programming expenses  advertising and promotional expenditures  technical expenses  and general and administrative expenses 
we strive to control these expenses by working closely with local market management 
the performance of radio station groups  such as ours  is customarily measured by the ability to generate station operating income 
see the quantitative reconciliation of station operating income to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap  that follows in this section

requires us to review the recorded values of our fcc broadcast licenses and goodwill for impairment on an annual basis 
we completed our annual evaluation during the fourth quarter of and recorded an impairment charge of million in order to reduce the carrying value of certain broadcast licenses and goodwill 
the fair market values of our broadcast licenses and reporting units were determined primarily by using a discounted cash flows approach 
we also utilized a market value approach  which included applying current acquisition multiples to broadcast cashflows  in order to validate our results 
several factors and variables contributed to the decrease in the fair market value of certain of our intangible assets  including long term overall compression in acquisition multiples across the industry 
other expense income 
interest expense  net of interest income  increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to a higher average cost of bank debt and increased levels of bank debt outstanding during the current year  principally the result of the stock repurchase program

seasonality we expect that our operations and revenues will be seasonal in nature  with generally lower revenue generated in the first quarter of the year and generally higher revenue generated in the second and fourth quarters of the year 
the seasonality of our business reflects the adult orientation of our formats and relationship between advertising purchases on these formats with the retail cycle 
this seasonality causes and will likely continue to cause a variation in our quarterly operating results 
such variations could have an effect on the timing of our cash flows 
liquidity and capital resources our principal need for funds has been to fund the acquisition of radio stations  expenses associated with our station and corporate operations  capital expenditures  repurchases of our class a common stock  and interest and 
table of contents debt service payments 
the following table summarizes our historical funding needs for the years ended december   and acquisitions and purchase of intangible assets capital expenditures repurchases of common stock repayments of bank borrowings interest payments in the short term  our principal future need for funds will include the funding of station operating expenses  corporate general and administrative expenses and interest and debt service payments 
in addition  in the long term  our funding needs will include future acquisitions and capital expenditures associated with maintaining our station and corporate operations and implementing hd radio tm technology 
in december  we purchased perpetual licenses from ibiquity  which will enable us to convert to and utilize ibiquity s hd radio tm technology on of our stations 
under the terms of the agreement with ibiquity  we will convert certain of our stations over a seven year period 
we anticipate that the average cost to convert each station will be between  and  our principal sources of funds for these requirements have been cash flow from operations and cash flow from financing activities  such as the proceeds from borrowings under credit facilities 
we believe that our presently projected cash flow from operations and present financing arrangements  including availability under our existing credit facilities  or borrowings that would be available from future financing arrangements  will be sufficient to meet our future capital needs  including the funding of pending acquisitions  operations and debt service for the next twelve months 
however  our cash flow from operations is subject to such factors as shifts in population  station listenership  demographics or audience tastes  and borrowings under financing arrangements are subject to financial covenants that can restrict our financial flexibility 
further  our ability to obtain additional equity or debt financing is also subject to market conditions and operating performance 
as such  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing at terms  and on the timetable  that may be necessary to meet our future capital needs 
see item ia risk factors 
cash flows from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities decreased by approximately million or for the year ended december  excluding non cash items  we generated comparable levels of operating income for as compared with the prior year 
as a result  the decreased in cash flows from operations was primarily attributable to the timing of certain payments 
cash flows from investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities decreased million  to million  from million for the year ended december  the decrease is due to the absence  in the current year period  of acquisitions and the purchases of intangible assets 
we completed acquisitions of broadcast licenses during the prior year period see historical acquisitions below and funded these acquisitions entirely in cash 
for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities increased million  to million  from million for the year ended december  for fiscal  we invested approximately million in station acquisitions and the purchase of certain broadcast licenses in its houston  texas market 
for  we funded approximately 
table of contents million of our million of acquisitions with shares of our class a common stock  which contributed to an overall decrease in cash outlays as compared with and years prior to cash flows from financing activities 
net cash used in provided by financing activities for the year ended december  net cash used in financing activities increase million  primarily due to the repurchase of  million shares of class a common stock and million shares of class b common stock  offset by an increase in borrowings under a new credit facility primarily to fund these repurchases 
during net cash used in financing related primarily to million paid to repurchase  shares of our class a common stock  offset by net borrowings under our credit facilities of utilized to fund acquisitions and the share repurchases 
net cash used in financing activities in was primarily the result of the repayment of a million note originally issued in connection with the acquisition of stations in kansas city  missouri in and million paid to repurchase  shares of our class a common stock 
historical acquisitions and dispositions 
for the year ended december  we completed the acquisition of radio stations in two markets for an aggregate purchase price of million 
we also swapped one license for another license plus a cash payment of million 
the acquisition costs were funded in cash 
pending acquisitions 
as of december   we had pending a swap transaction pursuant to which we would exchange one of our ft 
walton beach  florida radio stations  wyzb fm  for another owned by star broadcasting  inc  wtke fm 
specifically  the purchase agreement provided for the exchange of wyzb fm plus million in cash for wtke fm 
following the filing of the assignment applications with the fcc  the applications were challenged by qantum communications  who has some radio stations in the market and complained to the fcc that the swap would give us an unfair competitive advantage because the station we would acquire reaches more people than the station we would be giving up 
qantum also initiated litigation in the united states district court for the southern district of florida and secured a court decision that would require the sale of the station to qantum instead of to us 
although that decision is still subject to appeal  there is a possibility that we will be unable to consummate the exchange we had proposed with the seller 
sources of liquidity 
on june   we entered into a new million credit facility  which provided for a revolving credit facility of million and a term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of million 
we used the proceeds to repay all amounts outstanding under our existing credit facilities approximately million and to purchase million shares of our class a common stock pursuant to the modified dutch auction tender offer commenced on may   to purchase million shares of our class b common stock pursuant to a stock purchase agreement with ba capital and baci  and to pay fees and expenses related to the foregoing 
we expect to use the remaining proceeds to provide ongoing working capital which may include the funding of future acquisitions of radio stations and for other general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures 
the credit agreement governing the credit facilities also provides for additional  incremental revolving credit or term loan facilities in an aggregate principal amount of up to an additional million  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions 
these incremental credit facilities are permitted from time to time  and may be used to fund future acquisitions of radio stations and for other general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures 
any incremental credit facilities will be secured and guaranteed on the same basis as the term loan and revolving credit facility 
our obligations under the credit facilities are collateralized by substantially all of our assets in which a security interest may lawfully be granted including fcc licenses held by our subsidiaries  including  without limitation  intellectual property  and all of the capital stock of our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries except for broadcast software international  inc and of the capital stock of certain first tier foreign subsidiaries 
in addition  our obligations under the credit facilities are guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries 

table of contents the term loan facility will mature on june  and began to amortize in equal quarterly installments beginning on september   with of the initial aggregate advances payable each quarter during the first six years of the term  and due in each quarter during the seventh year 
the revolving credit facility will mature on june  and  except at our option  the commitment will remain unchanged up to that date 
borrowings under the term loan facility bear interest  at our option  at a rate equal to libor plus or the alternate base rate defined as the higher of the bank of america prime rate and the federal funds rate plus plus 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest  at our option  at a rate equal to libor plus a margin ranging between and or the alternate base rate plus a margin ranging between and in either case dependent upon our leverage ratio 
certain mandatory prepayments of the term loan facility will be required upon the occurrence of specified events  including upon the incurrence of certain additional indebtedness other than under any incremental credit facilities under the credit agreement and upon the sale of certain assets 
the representations  covenants and events of default in the credit agreement are customary for financing transactions of this nature 
events of default in the credit agreement include  among others  a the failure to pay when due the obligations owing under the credit facilities  b the failure to perform and not timely remedy  if applicable certain covenants  c cross default and cross acceleration  d the occurrence of bankruptcy or insolvency events  e certain judgments against us or any of our subsidiaries  f the loss  revocation or suspension of  or any material impairment in the ability to use of or more of  any of our material fcc licenses  g any representation or warranty made  or report  certificate or financial statement delivered  to the lenders subsequently proven to have been incorrect in any material respect  and h the occurrence of a change in control as defined in the credit agreement 
upon the occurrence of an event of default  the lenders may terminate the loan commitments  accelerate all loans and exercise any of their rights under the credit agreement and the ancillary loan documents as a secured party 
in may  we entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement that became effective in march  following the termination of our previous swap agreement 
this swap agreement effectively fixes the interest rate  based on libor  on million of our floating rate bank borrowings through march as a result  and including the fixed component of the swap  at december  our effective interest rate on loan amounts outstanding under our credit facility was 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  our management  in consultation with the audit committee of our board  evaluates these estimates  including those related to bad debts  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we recognize revenue from the sale of commercial broadcast time to advertisers when the commercials are broadcast  subject to meeting certain conditions such as persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists and collection is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time an advertisement is broadcast 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we determine the allowance based on historical write off experience and trends 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts monthly 
past due balances over days are reviewed individually for collectibility 
all other balances are reviewed and evaluated on a pooled basis 
account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
although our management believes that the allowance for doubtful accounts is our 
table of contents best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we have significant intangible assets recorded in our accounts 
these intangible assets are comprised primarily of broadcast licenses and goodwill acquired through the acquisition of radio stations 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that the carrying value of our goodwill and certain intangible assets be reviewed at least annually for impairment and charged to results of operations in the periods in which the recorded value of those assets is more than their fair market value 
for  we reviewed the fair market value of our broadcast licenses and goodwill and determined that their fair value exceeded their carrying amount and  as such  did not record an impairment charge 
during and  we recorded impairment charges of approximately and million  respectively in order to reduce the carrying value of certain broadcast licenses and goodwill to their respective fair market values 
as of december   we have billion in intangible assets and goodwill  which represent approximately of our total assets 
the fair market value of our broadcast licenses and reporting units  for purposes of our annual impairment tests  was derived primarily by using a discounted cash flows approach 
the fair market values derived include assumptions that contain a variety of variables 
these variables are based on industry data  historical experience and estimates of future performance and include  but are not limited to  revenue and expense growth rates for each radio market  revenue and expense growth rates for our stations in each market  overall discount rates based on our weighted average cost of capital and acquisition multiples 
the assumptions used in estimating the fair market value of goodwill are based on currently available data and our management s best estimates and  accordingly  a change in market conditions or other factors could have a significant effect on the estimated value 
a significant future decrease in the fair market value of broadcast licenses or goodwill in a market could result in additional impairment charges 
in connection with the elimination of amortization of broadcast licenses upon the adoption of sfas no 
 the reversal of our deferred tax liabilities relating to those intangible assets is no longer assured within our net operating loss carry forward period 
as a result  we have recorded deferred tax expense of million  million and million to establish a valuation allowance against net operating loss carry forwards generated during the year ended december   and  respectively  resulting from amortization of goodwill and broadcast licenses that is deductible for tax purposes  but is no longer amortized in the financial statements 
should we determine that we would be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  reduction of the valuation allowance would be recorded in income in the period such determination was made

off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of december  accounting pronouncements see note in the accompanying notes to the audited financial statements 
intangibles as of december   approximately of our total assets consisted of intangible assets  such as radio broadcast licenses and goodwill  the value of which depends significantly upon the operational results of our business 
we could not operate the radio stations without the related fcc license for each station 
fcc licenses are renewed every eight years  consequently  we continually monitor the activities of our stations to ensure they comply with all regulatory requirements 
historically  all of our licenses have been renewed at the end of their respective eight year periods  and we expect that all licenses will continue to be renewed in the future

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk at december   of our long term debt bears interest at variable rates 
accordingly  our earnings and after tax cash flow are affected by changes in interest rates 
assuming the current level of borrowings at variable rates and assuming a one percentage point change in the average interest rate under these borrowings  it is estimated that our interest expense and net income would have changed by million 
as part of our efforts to mitigate interest rate risk  in may  we entered into a forward starting effective march libor based interest rate swap agreement that effectively fixed the interest rate  based on libor  on million of our current floating rate bank borrowings for a three year period 
this agreement is intended to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and was not entered into for speculative purposes 
segregating the million of borrowings outstanding at december  that are not subject to the interest rate swap and assuming a one percentage point change in the average interest rate under these borrowings  it is estimated that our interest expense and net income would have changed by million 
in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  our management would likely take actions  in addition to the interest rate swap agreement discussed above  to mitigate our exposure 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  additional analysis is not possible at this time 
further  such analysis would not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
foreign currency risk as a result of the acquisition of caribbean communications company ltd  we have operations in five countries throughout the english speaking caribbean 
all foreign operations are measured in their local currencies 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations 

table of contents we maintain no derivative instruments to mitigate the exposure to translation and or transaction risk 
however  this does not preclude the adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future 
our foreign operations generated net income of approximately million for the year ended december  it is estimated that a change in the value of the us dollar to the eastern caribbean dollar or the trinidad and tobago dollar would change net income for the year ended december  by an amount less than million
