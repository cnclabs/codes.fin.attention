item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations overview we are a leader in enterprise decision management edm solutions that enable businesses to automate  improve and connect decisions to enhance business performance 
our predictive analytics and decision management systems power hundreds of billions of customer decisions each year 
we help companies acquire customers more efficiently  increase customer value  reduce fraud and credit losses  lower operating expenses and enter new markets more profitably 
most leading banks and credit card issuers rely on our solutions  as do many insurers  retailers  telecommunications providers  healthcare organizations  pharmaceutical and government agencies 
we also serve consumers through online services that enable people to purchase and understand their fico scores  the standard measure in the united states of credit risk  empowering them to manage their financial health 
most of our revenues are derived from the sale of products and services within the consumer credit  financial services and insurance industries  and during the year ended september   of our revenues were derived from within these industries 
a significant portion of our remaining revenues is derived from the telecommunications  retail industries  as well as the government sector 
our clients utilize our products and services to facilitate a variety of business processes  including customer marketing and acquisition  account origination  credit and underwriting risk management  fraud loss prevention and control  and client account and policyholder management 
a significant portion of our revenues is derived from transactional or unit based software license fees  annual license fees under long term software license arrangements  transactional fees derived under scoring  network service or internal hosted software arrangements  and annual software maintenance fees 
the recurrence of these revenues is  to a significant degree  dependent upon our clients continued usage of our products and services in their business activities 
the more significant activities underlying the use of our products in these areas include credit and debit card usage or active account levels  lending acquisition  origination and customer management activity  workers compensation and automobile medical injury insurance claims  and wireless and wireline calls and subscriber levels 
approximately of our revenues during fiscal were derived from arrangements with transactional or unit based pricing 
we also derive revenues from other sources which generally do not recur and include  but are not limited to  perpetual or time based licenses with upfront payment terms  non recurring professional service arrangements and gain share arrangements where revenue is derived based on percentages of client revenue growth or cost reductions attributable to our products 
within a number of our sectors there has been a sizable amount of industry consolidation 
in addition  many of our sectors are experiencing increased levels of competition 
as a result of these factors  we believe that future revenues in particular sectors may decline 
however  due to the long term customer arrangements we have with many of our customers  the near term impact of these declines may be more limited in certain sectors 
one measure used by management as an indicator of our business performance is the volume of bookings achieved 
we define a booking as estimated future contractual revenues  including agreements with perpetual  multi year and annual terms 
bookings values may include i estimates of variable fee components such as hours to be incurred under new professional services arrangements and customer account or transaction activity for agreements with transactional based fee arrangements  ii additional or expanded business from renewals of contracts  and iii to a lesser extent  previous customers that have attrited and been resold only as a result of a significant sales effort 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we achieved bookings of million  including five deals with bookings values of million or more 
in comparison  bookings in the fourth quarter of fiscal were million  including nine deals with bookings values of million or more 
management regards the volume of bookings achieved  among other factors  as an important indicator of future revenues  but they are not comparable to  nor should they be substituted for  an analysis of our revenues  and they are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including those described in item a risk factors  above  concerning timing and contingencies affecting product delivery and performance 
although many of our contracts have fixed noncancelable terms  some of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice or without notice 

table of contents accordingly  we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize all of our bookings as backlog that will generate future revenue 
our revenues derived from clients outside the united states continue to grow  and may in the future grow more rapidly than our revenues from domestic clients 
international revenues totaled million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing  and of total consolidated revenues in each of these years 
in addition to clients acquired via our acquisitions  we believe that our international growth is a product of successful relationships with third parties that assist in international sales efforts and our own increased sales focus internationally  and we expect that the percentage of our revenues derived from international clients will increase in the future 
in march  we sold the assets and products associated with our mortgage banking solutions product line  which was included in the strategy machines solutions segment  for million in cash 
we recognized a million pre tax gain  but a million after tax loss on the sale due to goodwill associated with the product line that was not deductible for income tax purposes 
for fiscal and  we recorded revenues from the mortgage banking solutions product line of million and million  respectively 
the earnings contribution from the mortgage banking solutions product line was not significant to our fiscal or fiscal results of operations 
our reportable segments are strategy machine solutions  scoring solutions  professional services and analytic software tools 
although we sell solutions and services into a large number of end user product and industry markets  our reportable business segments reflect the primary method in which management organizes and evaluates internal financial information to make operating decisions and assess performance 
comparative segment revenues  operating income  and related financial information for the years ended september   and are set forth in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements

table of contents fiscal revenues compared to fiscal revenues strategy machine solutions segment revenues decreased million due partially to the sale of our mortgage banking solutions product line  which resulted in a million decline in segment revenues 
in addition  segment revenues declined due to a million decrease in revenues from our customer management solutions  a million decrease in revenues from our originations solutions  a million decrease in revenues from our insurance and healthcare solutions and a million decrease in revenues from our other strategy machine solutions 
the revenue decrease was partially offset by a million increase in revenues from our collection and recovery solutions  a million increase in revenues from our consumer solutions and a million increase in revenues from our fraud solutions 
the decrease in customer management solutions revenues was the result of a decline in transactional based revenues due to the loss of volumes from a significant customer  which resulted from industry consolidation 
the decrease in originations solutions revenues was the result of a decline in transactional based revenues  unfavorable pricing on a renewed customer contract and  to a lesser extent  a reduction in sales of software licenses 
the decrease in insurance and healthcare solutions revenues was attributable primarily to a decline in bill review volumes associated with our existing customer base and loss of customer accounts 
the increase in collections and recovery solutions revenues was attributable primarily to several large license sales and increased volumes associated with transactional based agreements 
the large license sales resulted from successful international sales efforts 
the increase in consumer solutions revenues was attributable to increases in revenues derived from myfico 
com and our strategic alliance partners 
the increase in fraud solutions revenues was attributable primarily due to increased volumes associated with transactional based agreements 
however  we have experienced a delay in a product upgrade  which impacted current year bookings and revenues and may continue to impact fraud solutions bookings and revenues in future periods 
scoring solutions segment revenues increased million primarily due an increase in revenues derived from risk scoring services at the credit reporting agencies 
we also had an increase in revenues derived from our fico expansion score product  which provides scores on us consumers who do not have traditional fico scores because they do not have a sufficient number of credit accounts being reported to the credit reporting agencies 
the revenue increase was partially offset by a decline in revenues derived from our own prescreening and account management services sold directly to users  which resulted from increased pricing pressures and an unfavorable impact on pricing from the merger of two customers 
we expect that continued pricing and competitive pressures will adversely affect segment revenues in fiscal during fiscal and  revenues generated from our agreements with equifax  transunion and experian collectively accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our total revenues  including revenues from these customers that are recorded in our other segments 
professional services segment revenues increased million from consulting and implementation services for customer management products  for services to develop predictive models for a large customer and implementation services for blaze advisor 
the increase was partially offset by a decline in implementation services for our collection and recovery products and fraud products and a decline in industry consulting services 
the decline in implementation services for fraud products was partially the result of a delay in a product upgrade 
analytic software tools segment revenues increased million primarily due to an increase in sales of perpetual and term licenses of blaze advisor and to a lesser extent sales of model builder software applications 
this increase reflects a larger number of blaze advisor license sales that exceeded million in the united states and emea region 
the increase in revenues was also partially the result of higher maintenance revenues  which resulted from the overall growth in our installed base of blaze advisor 
fiscal revenues compared to fiscal revenues strategy machine solutions segment revenues increased million due to a million increase in revenues from our fraud solutions  a million increase in revenues from our consumer solutions  a million increase in revenues from our collections and recovery solutions  and a million increase in revenues from our other strategy machine solutions  partially offset by a million decrease in revenues from our marketing solutions and a million decrease in revenues from our insurance and healthcare solutions 

table of contents the increase in fraud solutions revenues was attributable to an increase in license sales and an increase in transaction volumes 
the increase in consumer solutions revenues was partially attributable to increases in revenues derived from myfico 
com and our strategic alliance partners 
the increase in consumer solutions revenues was also the result of a revision made during fiscal to the estimated period during which revenue is earned on sales of certain products that provide consumers access to multiple credit scores 
the revision  which increased revenues by million in fiscal  resulted from the completion of a study that showed that consumers were accessing their scores over a shorter period of time than initially estimated 
the increase in collections and recovery solutions revenues was attributable primarily to an increase in perpetual license sales revenues 
this increase was driven by higher international license sales due to increased sales efforts 
the decrease in marketing solutions revenues was attributable primarily to the loss of two large financial services customers during fiscal  which resulted from industry consolidation 
the decrease in insurance and healthcare solutions revenues was attributable primarily to the loss of several customer accounts that primarily occurred in fiscal scoring solutions segment revenues increased million primarily due to an increase in revenues derived from risk scoring services at the credit reporting agencies  resulting from increased sales of scores for prescreening activities  and an increase in revenues derived from our own prescreening services directly to users 
we also achieved increased revenues from our fico expansion score product 
during fiscal and  revenues generated from our agreements with equifax  transunion and experian  collectively accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our total revenues  including revenues from these customers that are recorded in our other segments 
professional services segment revenues increased million from industry consulting services  implementation services for our blaze advisor products and predictive modeling services 
the increase in industry consulting services revenue resulted from initiatives to expand our professional service offerings into additional industry markets 
analytic software tools segment revenues decreased million primarily due to a decline in sales of perpetual licenses of blaze advisor 
this decline reflects the timing of blaze advisor sales  which includes large individual contracts 
the decline in revenues was partially offset by higher maintenance revenues and an increase in sales of model builder software applications

the increase in travel costs reflects the increase in professional service projects in the current year and associated travel to client locations 
the decrease in facilities and infrastructure costs was attributable primarily to a reduction in depreciation expense  lower outside costs for information systems  and because fiscal included system integration costs associated with our acquisition of london bridge 
the decline in third party software and data costs was attributable to a decrease in insurance and healthcare solutions costs  which was a result of lower revenues for these products 
in fiscal  we expect that cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues will be consistent with the cost of revenues incurred during fiscal research and development research and development expenses include the personnel and related overhead costs incurred in development of new products and services  including primarily the research of mathematical and statistical models and the development of new versions of strategy machine solutions and analytic software tools 
the fiscal over decrease of million in research and development expenditures was attributable primarily to a decrease in personnel and related costs of million  a million decrease in facilities and infrastructure costs and a million decrease in other costs

the terms of the new notes are similar to the terms of the senior notes described above  except that i upon conversion  we will pay holders cash in an amount equal to the lesser of the principal amount of such notes and the conversion value of such notes  and to the extent such conversion value exceeds the principal amount of the notes  the remainder of the conversion obligation in cash or common shares or combination thereof  ii in the event of a change of control  we may be required in certain circumstances to pay a make whole premium on the new notes converted in connection with the change of control and iii if the conversion condition in the first clause iii in the third paragraph preceding this paragraph is triggered and the closing price of our common stock is greater than of the conversion price but less than or equal to of the conversion price  the holders converting new notes shall receive cash with a value equal to of the principal amount of new notes on the conversion date 

table of contents the first date noteholders could require us to repurchase the senior notes was august  as a result  certain noteholders exercised their repurchase option and we repurchased million of the senior notes 
as of september   million of the senior notes remain outstanding and are classified as short term debt in our consolidated balance sheet  because noteholders may require us to repurchase for cash all or part of the senior notes on august  credit agreement in october  we entered into a five year unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks 
in july  we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement that increased the revolving credit facility from million to million 
proceeds from the credit facility can be used for working capital and general corporate purposes and may also be used for the refinancing of existing debt  acquisitions  and the repurchase of the company s common stock 
interest on amounts borrowed under the credit facility is based on i a base rate  which is the greater of a the prime rate and b the federal funds rate plus or ii libor plus an applicable margin 
the margin on libor borrowings ranges from to and is determined based on our consolidated leverage ratio 
in addition  we must pay utilization fees if borrowings and commitments under the credit facility exceed of the total credit facility commitment  as well as facility fees 
the credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants  including maintenance of consolidated leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios 
the credit facility also contains covenants typical of unsecured facilities 
as of september   we had million of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at an average interest rate of 
capital resources and liquidity outlook as of september   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable security investments 
we believe that these balances  as well as borrowings from our million revolving credit facility and anticipated cash flows from operating activities  will be sufficient to fund our working and other capital requirements and any repayment of existing debt  including the possible retirement of our senior notes  over the course of the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future 
in the normal course of business  we evaluate the merits of acquiring technology or businesses  or establishing strategic relationships with or investing in these businesses 
we may elect to use available cash and cash equivalents and marketable security investments to fund such activities in the future 
in the event additional needs for cash arise  we may raise additional funds from a combination of sources  including the potential issuance of debt or equity securities 
additional financing might not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds were not available or were not available on acceptable terms  our ability to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities or respond to competitive pressures could be limited 
contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual obligations at september  fiscal year thereafter total in thousands senior notes revolving line of credit operating lease obligations total commitments million represents the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes 
our senior notes are classified in short term debt in our consolidated balance sheet at september   because holders may require us to purchase the senior notes upon delivery of a written purchase notice on specific dates  the earliest of which is august refer to note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for more detailed information regarding the senior notes

critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
these accounting principles require management to make certain judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we periodically evaluate our estimates including those relating to revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions  internal use software  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on the specific circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition software license fee revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred at our customer s location  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue when an arrangement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
vsoe of fair value is based on the normal pricing practices for those products and services when sold separately by us and customer renewal rates for post contract customer support services 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  the revenue is deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
the determination of whether fees are fixed or determinable and collection is probable involves the use of assumptions 
we evaluate contract terms and customer information to ensure that these criteria are met prior to our recognition of license fee revenue 
changes to the elements in a software arrangement  the ability to identify vsoe for those elements  the fair value of the respective elements  and change to a product s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue 
when software licenses are sold together with implementation or consulting services  license fees are recognized upon delivery provided that the above criteria are met  payment of the license fees is not dependent upon the performance of the services  and the services do not provide significant customization or modification of the software products and are not essential to the functionality of the software that was delivered 
for arrangements with services that are essential to the functionality of the software  the license and related service revenues are recognized using contract accounting as described below 
if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes fixed or determinable  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that collectibility is not probable  revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment 
if there is uncertainty as to the customer s acceptance of our deliverables  revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance  expiration of the acceptance period  or when we can demonstrate we meet the acceptance criteria 
revenues from post contract customer support services  such as software maintenance  are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the support period 
the majority of our software maintenance agreements provide technical support as well as unspecified software product upgrades and releases when and if made available by us during the term of the support period 

table of contents revenues recognized from our credit scoring  data processing  data management and internet delivery services are recognized as these services are performed  provided persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  fees are fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
the determination of certain of our credit scoring and data processing revenues requires the use of estimates  principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly or quarterly basis in arrears 
in these instances  we estimate transaction volumes based on preliminary customer transaction information  if available  or based on average actual reported volumes for an immediate trailing period 
differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported 
we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates and actual reported volumes in the past and anticipate that we will be able to continue to make reasonable estimates in the future 
if for some reason we were unable to reasonably estimate transaction volumes in the future  revenue may be deferred until actual customer data was received  and this could have a material impact on our results of operations during the period of time that we changed accounting methods 
transactional or unit based license fees under software license arrangements  network service and internally hosted software agreements are recognized as revenue based on system usage or when fees based on system usage exceed monthly minimum license fees  provided persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  fees are fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
the determination of certain of our transactional or unit based license fee revenues requires the use of estimates  principally related to transaction usage or active account volumes in instances where this information is reported to us by our clients on a monthly or quarterly basis in arrears 
in these instances  we estimate transaction volumes based on preliminary customer transaction information  if available  or based on average actual reported volumes for an immediate trailing period 
differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported 
we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates and actual reported volumes in the past and anticipate that we will be able to continue to make reasonable estimates in the future 
if for some reason we were unable to reasonably estimate customer account or transaction volumes in the future  revenue would be deferred until actual customer data was received  and this could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations 
we provide consulting  training  model development and software integration services under both hourly based time and materials and fixed priced contracts 
revenues from these services are generally recognized as the services are performed 
for fixed price service contracts  we apply the percentage of completion method of contract accounting to determine progress towards completion  which requires the use of estimates 
in such instances  management is required to estimate the input measures  generally based on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours of the project  with consideration also given to output measures  such as contract milestones  when applicable 
adjustments to estimates are made in the period in which the facts requiring such revisions become known and  accordingly  recognized revenues and profits are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
estimated losses  if any  are recorded in the period in which current estimates of total contract revenue and contract costs indicate a loss 
if substantive uncertainty related to customer acceptance of services exists  we apply the completed contract method of accounting and defer the associated revenue until the contract is completed 
if we are unable to accurately estimate the input measures used for percentage of completion accounting  revenue would be deferred until the contract is complete  and this could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations 
revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method in excess of contract billings is recorded as an unbilled receivable 
such amounts are generally billable upon reaching certain performance milestones as defined by individual contracts 
billings collected in advance of performance and recognition of revenue under contracts are recorded as deferred revenue 
in certain of our non software arrangements  we enter into contracts that include the delivery of a combination of two or more of our service offerings 
typically  such multiple element arrangements incorporate the design and development of data management tools or systems and an ongoing obligation to manage  host or otherwise run solutions for our customer 
such arrangements are divided into separate units of accounting provided that the delivered item has stand alone value and there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the total arrangement fee is allocated to the undelivered elements based on their fair values and to the initial delivered elements using the residual method 
revenue is recognized separately  and in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  for each element 

table of contents as described above  sometimes our customer arrangements have multiple deliverables  including service elements 
generally  our multiple element arrangements fall within the scope of specific accounting standards that provide guidance regarding the separation of elements in multiple deliverable arrangements and the allocation of consideration among those elements eg  american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended 
if not  we apply the separation provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the provisions of eitf issue no 
require us to unbundle multiple element arrangements into separate units of accounting when the delivered element s has stand alone value and fair value of the undelivered element s exists 
when we are able to unbundle the arrangement into separate units of accounting  we apply one of the accounting policies described above to each unit 
if we are unable to unbundle the arrangement into separate units of accounting  we apply one of the accounting policies described above to the entire arrangement 
sometimes this results in recognizing the entire arrangement fee when delivery of the last element in a multiple element arrangement occurs 
for example  if the last undelivered element is a service  we recognize revenue for the entire arrangement fee as the service is performed  or if no pattern of performance is discernable  we recognize revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the arrangement 
we record revenue on a net basis for those sales in which we have in substance acted as an agent or broker in the transaction 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make estimates regarding the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
when we evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze specific accounts receivable balances  historical bad debts  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment cycles 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of expense for any period if we were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
we have not experienced significant variances in the past between our estimated and actual doubtful accounts and anticipate that we will be able to continue to make reasonable estimates in the future 
if for some reason we did not reasonably estimate the amount of our doubtful accounts in the future  it could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations 
business acquisitions  valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets our business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets  and in certain cases non recurring charges associated with the write off of in process research and development ipr d  which affect the amount of current and future period charges and amortization expense 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired  including identified intangible assets  in connection with our business combinations accounted for by the purchase method of accounting 
we amortize our definite lived intangible assets using the straight line method or based on forecasted cash flows associated with the assets over the estimated useful lives  while ipr d is recorded as a non recurring charge on the acquisition date 
goodwill is not amortized  but rather is periodically assessed for impairment 
the determination of the value of these components of a business combination  as well as associated asset useful lives  requires management to make various estimates and assumptions 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from product sales and services  maintenance agreements  consulting contracts  customer contracts  and acquired developed technologies and patents or trademarks  expected costs to develop the ipr d into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired products and services will continue to be used in our product portfolio  and discount rates 
management s estimates of fair value and useful lives are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur and assumptions may change 
estimates using different assumptions could also produce significantly different results 
we continually review the events and circumstances related to our financial performance and economic environment for factors that would provide evidence of the impairment of our intangible assets 
when impairment indicators are identified with respect to our previously recorded intangible assets  then we test for impairment using 
table of contents undiscounted cash flows 
if such tests indicate impairment  then we measure the impairment as the difference between the carrying value of the asset and the fair value of the asset  which is measured using discounted cash flows 
significant management judgment is required in forecasting of future operating results  which are used in the preparation of the projected discounted cash flows and should different conditions prevail  material write downs of net intangible assets and other long lived assets could occur 
we periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our acquired intangible assets 
a reduction in our estimate of remaining useful lives  if any  could result in increased amortization expense in future periods 
we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and more frequently if impairment indicators are identified 
we have determined that our reporting units are the same as our reportable segments 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value 
we estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flow valuation models and by comparing our reporting units to guideline publicly traded companies 
these methods require estimates of our future revenues  profits  capital expenditures  working capital  and other relevant factors  as well as selecting appropriate guideline publicly traded companies for each reporting unit 
we estimate these amounts by evaluating historical trends  current budgets  operating plans  industry data  and other relevant factors 
the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded its respective carrying value in fiscal  indicating the underlying goodwill of each reporting unit was not impaired as of our most recent testing date 
accordingly  we were not required to complete the second step of the goodwill impairment test 
the timing and frequency of our goodwill impairment test is based on an ongoing assessment of events and circumstances that would more than likely reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
we will continue to monitor our goodwill balance and conduct formal tests on at least an annual basis or earlier when impairment indicators are present 
there are various assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment loss  and estimates using different  but each reasonable  assumptions could produce significantly different results and materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates utilized were appropriate based on the information available to management 
the timing and recognition of impairment losses by us in the future  if any  may be highly dependent upon our estimates and assumptions 
share based compensation prior to october   we accounted for our share based employee compensation plans under the measurement and recognition provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  as permitted by financial accounting standards board fasb sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
we generally recorded no employee compensation expense for options granted prior to october  as options granted generally had exercise prices equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
we also recorded no compensation expense in connection with our employee stock purchase plan as the purchase price of the stock was not less than of the lower of the fair market value of our common stock at the beginning of each offering period or at the end of each offering period 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we disclosed our net income and earnings per share as if we had applied the fair value based method in measuring compensation expense for our share based incentive awards 
effective october   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation expense that we recognize beginning on that date includes expense associated with the fair value of all awards granted on and after october   and expense for the unvested portion of previously granted awards outstanding on october  results for prior periods have not been restated 
we estimate the fair value of options granted using the black scholes option valuation model and the assumptions shown in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on a combination of the implied volatility of publicly traded options on our common stock and our historical volatility rate  consistent with sfas no 
r and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility 
we estimate expected term consistent with the 
table of contents simplified method identified in sab for share based awards 
we elected to use the simplified method as we changed the contractual life for share based awards from ten to seven years starting in fiscal the simplified method calculates the expected term as the average of the vesting and contractual terms of the award 
previously  we estimated expected term based on historical exercise patterns 
the dividend yield assumption is based on historical dividend payouts 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the term of our employee options 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
for options granted  we amortize the fair value on a straight line basis 
all options are amortized over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
if factors change we may decide to use different assumptions under the black scholes option valuation model in the future  which could materially affect our share based compensation expense  net income and earnings per share 
income taxes we use the asset and liability approach to account for income taxes 
this methodology recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax base of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we then record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that more likely than not will be realized 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  which requires the use of estimates 
if we determine during any period that we could realize a larger net deferred tax asset than the recorded amount  we would adjust the deferred tax asset to increase income for the period or reduce goodwill if such deferred tax asset relates to an acquisition 
conversely  if we determine that we would be unable to realize a portion of our recorded deferred tax asset  we would adjust the deferred tax asset to record a charge to income for the period or increase goodwill if such deferred tax asset relates to an acquisition 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  there is no assurance that our the valuation allowance will not need to be increased to cover additional deferred tax assets that may not be realizable  and such an increase could have a material adverse impact on our income tax provision and results of operations in the period in which such determination is made 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities also involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management s expectations could also have a material impact on our income tax provision and results of operations in the period in which such determination is made 
contingencies and litigation we are subject to various proceedings  lawsuits and claims relating to products and services  technology  labor  shareholder and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes and the potential range of probable losses in these matters 
if the potential loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
if the potential loss is considered less than probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated  disclosure of the matter is considered 
the amount of loss accrual or disclosure  if any  is determined after analysis of each matter  and is subject to adjustment if warranted by new developments or revised strategies 
due to uncertainties related to these matters  accruals or disclosures are based on the best information available at the time 
significant judgment is required in both the assessment of likelihood and in the determination of a range of potential losses 
revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations

these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase
