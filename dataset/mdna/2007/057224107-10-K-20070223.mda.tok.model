international operations we operate in over countries worldwide  and our operations are subject to the risks inherent in doing business in multiple countries with various laws and differing political environments 
these risks include the risks identified in item a 
risk factors 
although it is impossible to predict the likelihood of such occurrences or their effect on us  we routinely evaluate these risks and take appropriate actions to mitigate the risks where possible 
however  there can be no assurance that an occurrence of any one or more of these events would not have a material adverse effect on our operations

research and development  patents we are engaged in research and development activities directed primarily toward the improvement of existing products and services  the design of specialized products to meet specific customer needs and the development of new products  processes and services 
for information regarding the amounts of research and development expense in each of the three years in the period ended december   see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item herein 

table of contents we have followed a policy of seeking patent and trademark protection both inside and outside the united states for products and methods that appear to have commercial significance 
we believe our patents and trademarks to be adequate for the conduct of our business  and aggressively pursue protection of our patents against patent infringement worldwide 
although patent and trademark protection is important to our business and future prospects  we consider the reliability and quality of our products and the technical skills of our personnel to be more important 
no single patent or trademark is considered to be critical to our business 
raw materials we purchase various raw materials and component parts for use in manufacturing our products 
the principal materials we purchase are steel alloys including chromium and nickel  titanium  beryllium  copper  tungsten carbide  synthetic and natural diamonds  printed circuit boards and other electronic components and hydrocarbon based chemical feed stocks 
these materials are generally available from multiple sources and could be subject to rising costs 
we have not experienced significant shortages of these materials and normally do not carry inventories of such materials in excess of those reasonably required to meet our production schedules 
we do not expect significant interruptions in supply  but there can be no assurance that there will be no price or supply issues over the long term 
employees on december   we had approximately  employees  as compared with approximately  employees on december  approximately  of these employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements or similar type labor arrangements  of which the majority are outside the us based upon the geographic diversification of these employees  we believe any risk of loss from employee strikes or other collective actions would not be material to the conduct of our operations taken as a whole 
we believe that our relations with our employees are good

environmental matters we are committed to the health and safety of people  protection of the environment and compliance with laws  regulations and our policies 
our past and present operations include activities that are subject to domestic including us federal  state and local and international regulations with regard to air and water quality and other environmental matters 
we believe we are in substantial compliance with these regulations 
regulation in this area continues to evolve  and changes in standards of enforcement of existing regulations  as well as the enactment and enforcement of new legislation  may require us and our customers to modify  supplement or replace equipment or facilities or to change or discontinue present methods of operation 
we are involved in voluntary remediation projects at some of our present and former manufacturing locations or other facilities  the majority of which relate to properties obtained in acquisitions or to sites no longer actively used in operations 
on rare occasions  remediation activities are conducted as specified by a government agency issued consent decree or agreed order 
remediation costs are accrued based on estimates of probable exposure using currently available facts  existing environmental permits  technology and presently enacted laws and regulations 
for sites where we are primarily responsible for the remediation  our cost estimates are developed based on internal evaluations and are not discounted 
such accruals are recorded when it is probable that we will be obligated to pay amounts for environmental site evaluation  remediation or related activities  and such amounts can be reasonably estimated 
if the obligation can only be estimated within a range  we accrue the minimum amount in the range 
such accruals are recorded even if significant uncertainties exist over the ultimate cost of the remediation 
ongoing environmental compliance costs  such as obtaining environmental permits  installation of pollution control equipment and waste disposal  are expensed as incurred 
during the year ended december   we spent approximately million to comply with domestic and international standards regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment collectively  environmental regulations 
this cost includes the total spent on remediation projects at current or former sites  superfund projects and environmental compliance activities  exclusive of capital expenditures 
in  we expect to spend approximately million to comply with environmental regulations 
during the year ended december   we incurred approximately million in capital expenditures for environmental control equipment  and we estimate we will incur approximately million during in addition  we estimate we will incur approximately million in capital expenditures for the relocation of an existing plant in the uk to comply with local environmental regulations of which approximately million will be spent in and the remainder in based upon current information  we believe that our compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position because we have either established adequate reserves or our cost for that compliance is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act known as superfund or cercla imposes liability for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
superfund liability is imposed without regard to fault  even if the waste disposal was in compliance with laws and regulations 
we have been identified as a potentially responsible party prp in remedial activities related to various superfund sites  and we accrue our share of the estimated remediation costs of the site based on the ratio of the estimated volume of waste we contributed to the site to the total volume of waste disposed at the site 
with the joint and several liability imposed under superfund  a prp may be required to pay more than its proportional share of such costs 

table of contents we have been identified as a prp at various superfund sites discussed below 
the united states environmental protection agency the epa and appropriate state agencies supervise investigative and cleanup activities at these sites 
for the year ended december   we paid million in superfund costs and have accrued an additional million related to these sites 
payments made in are in addition to amounts previously paid in settlements  cash calls or other superfund costs  and these ongoing contributions reduce our financial liability for the total site cleanup costs shown below 
when used in the descriptions of the sites that follow  the word de minimis refers to the smallest prps  whose contribution rate is usually less than 
a in  baker oil tools  baker petrolite and predecessor entities of baker petrolite were named as prps by the state of california s department of toxic substances control for the gibson site in bakersfield  california 
costs are now estimated at million to million  of which million has been raised 
allocation information has been updated and our combined volume is now for liquids and for solids 
b in  a hughes christensen predecessor  baker oil tools  inteq and one of our former subsidiaries were named as prps in the force road state superfund site located in brazoria county  texas 
the texas commission on environmental quality tceq is overseeing the investigation and remediation at the force road site 
we participate as a member of the steering and technical committees to effectively manage the project because our volumetric contribution is currently estimated at approximately 
the onsite investigation was completed in late  and the offsite investigation is expected to be complete in early the estimate of site remediation costs used for initial settlement purposes was million  however  we anticipate that a more accurate calculation of site remediation costs will be possible once the offsite investigation is complete 
approximately million has been raised from de minimis settlements 
we believe that after negotiation of additional early settlements with other prps  future cost recovery actions against recalcitrant parties  development of remedial alternatives and other factors  our ultimate share of responsibility for cleanup costs at the site will be less than initial estimates 
c in  baker petrolite predecessors  hughes christensen predecessors and several of our former subsidiaries were identified as prps for the malone site located on campbell bayou road in texas city  texas 
the epa oversees the investigation and remediation of the malone site and has engaged in emergency removal actions 
the investigation is nearly complete and remedial alternatives have been developed and submitted to the epa for evaluation 
the estimates for the various cleanup options at the malone site range from million to almost million with the most likely scenarios in the range of million to million 
our contribution is currently estimated at approximately 
a lawsuit filed by the current owners of the site and a related entity against the prps seeking recovery of certain alleged damages has not been fully resolved  and may affect the ultimate costs associated with this superfund site 
d in  we were identified as a de minimis prp by the epa for the operating industries  inc superfund site in monterrey park  california 
a settlement offer to all remaining de minimis parties has been repeatedly delayed  but is now expected in the epa and steering committee have incurred million and expect an additional million in cleanup costs 
information provided by the epa in indicates that our contribution is  although our ultimate liability has yet to be negotiated and may include a premium for early settlement 
e in  baker petrolite was notified by the epa of their potential involvement at the cooper drum superfund site located in south gate  california 
we responded to an additional inquiry from the epa in at this time there is no estimate available for comprehensive cleanup costs or our allocation and  accordingly  the extent of our financial liability at the site is unknown 
f in  we were one of five prps to receive an information request from the epa regarding the washington county lead district superfund site  a federal superfund located in washington county  missouri 
we have responded to the epa regarding our involvement with two of the six mines listed in the information request 
a preliminary screening and removal action has been completed by the epa to evaluate the impacts of lead and other heavy metals on the soil and groundwater in the area  however  the project is still in the initial stages and there is insufficient information to estimate our potential contribution to the cleanup costs 
g in  baker petrolite received a general notice of potential liability letter from the epa concerning the rrg clayton chemical superfund site in sauget  illinois and its impact on the adjacent sauget area groundwater superfund site 
we have participated in cleanup activities at the clayton site as a small party with an allocation just over the de minimis level 
our ultimate liability may now include some responsibility for the downgradient groundwater cleanup at the sauget area groundwater superfund site  but insufficient information is available to estimate the potential cost to the company 

table of contents h in  a settlement demand was received from the prp group for the pulvair superfund site located in millington  tennessee for waste sent to the site by milchem  a predecessor to baker hughes drilling fluids 
the matter has not yet been resolved  but is expected to be settled at a cost of less than million 
in addition to the sites mentioned above  there are four superfund sites where we have ongoing obligations 
the remedial work at most of these sites has been completed and remaining operations are limited to groundwater recovery and or monitoring 
the monitoring phase can continue for up to years 
our aggregate cost for these sites is estimated to be approximately million over this period of time 
there were also four superfund sites that were settled during at a combined cost of less than million 
while prps in superfund actions have joint and several liability for all costs of remediation  it is not possible at this time to quantify our ultimate exposure because some of the projects are either in the investigative or early remediation stage 
however  based upon current information  we do not believe that probable or reasonably possible expenditures in connection with the sites described above are likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements because we have recorded adequate reserves to cover the estimate we presently believe will be our ultimate liability in the matter 
further  other prps involved in the sites have substantial assets and may reasonably be expected to pay their share of the cost of remediation  and  in some circumstances  we have insurance coverage or contractual indemnities from third parties to cover a portion of or the ultimate liability 
we are subject to various other governmental proceedings and regulations  including foreign regulations  relating to environmental matters  but we do not believe that any of these matters is likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
we continue to focus on reducing future environmental liabilities by maintaining appropriate company standards and improving our assurance programs 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item herein for further discussion of environmental matters 
environmental matters contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended the securities act  and section e of the exchange act each a forward looking statement 
the words will  believe  to be  expect  estimate and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
our expectations regarding our compliance with environmental regulations and our expenditures to comply with environmental regulations  including without limitation our capital expenditures for environmental control equipment  are only our forecasts regarding these matters 
these forecasts may be substantially different from actual results  which may be affected by the following factors changes in environmental regulations  a material change in our allocation or other unexpected  adverse outcomes with respect to sites where we have been named as a prp  including without limitation the superfund sites described above  the discovery of new sites of which we are not aware and where additional expenditures may be required to comply with environmental regulations  an unexpected discharge of hazardous materials in the course of our business or operations  a catastrophic event causing discharges into the environment  or an acquisition of one or more new businesses 
item a 
risk factors an investment in our common stock involves various risks 
when considering an investment in our company  one should consider carefully all of the risk factors described below  as well as other information included and incorporated by reference in this report 
these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones facing us and there may be additional matters that we are unaware of or that we currently consider immaterial 
all of these could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows and  thus  the value of an investment in our company 
risk factors related to the worldwide oil and natural gas industry our business is focused on providing products and services to the worldwide oil and natural gas industry  therefore  our risk factors include those factors that impact  either positively or negatively  the markets for oil and natural gas 
expenditures by our customers for exploration  development and production of oil and natural gas are based on their expectations of future hydrocarbon demand  the risks associated with developing the reserves and the future value of the hydrocarbon reserves 
their evaluation of the future value is based  in part  on their expectations for global demand  global supply and other factors that influence oil and natural gas prices 
the key risk factors currently influencing the worldwide oil and natural gas markets are discussed below 
demand for oil and natural gas is subject to factors beyond our control  which may adversely affect our operating results 
growth in worldwide demand for oil and natural gas  as well as the demand for our services  is highly correlated with global economic growth  and in particular by the economic growth of countries such as the us and china  who are significant users of oil and natural gas 
increases in global economic activity  particularly in china and developing asia  create more demand for oil and 
table of contents natural gas and higher oil and natural gas prices 
a slowing of global economic growth  and in particular in the us or china  will likely reduce demand for oil and natural gas  increase spare productive capacity and result in lower prices and adversely impact the demand for our services 
volatility of oil and natural gas prices can adversely affect demand for our products and services 
volatility in oil and natural gas prices can also impact our customers activity levels and spending for our products and services 
while current energy prices are important contributors to positive cash flow for our customers  expectations about future prices and price volatility are generally more important for determining future spending levels 
while higher oil and natural gas prices generally lead to increased spending by our customers  sustained high energy prices can be an impediment to economic growth  and can therefore negatively impact spending by our customers 
our customers also take into account the volatility of energy prices and other risk factors by requiring higher returns for individual projects if there is higher perceived risk 
any of these factors could affect the demand for oil and natural gas and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
supply of oil and natural gas is subject to factors beyond our control  which may adversely affect our operating results 
productive capacity for oil and natural gas is dependent on our customers decisions to develop and produce oil and natural gas reserves 
the ability to produce oil and natural gas can be affected by the number and productivity of new wells drilled and completed  as well as the rate of production and resulting depletion of existing wells 
advanced technologies  such as horizontal drilling  improve total recovery but also result in a more rapid production decline 
access to prospects and capital are also important to our customers 
access to prospects may be limited because host governments do not allow access to the reserves or because another oil and natural gas exploration company owns the rights to develop the prospect 
access to capital is dependent on our customers ability to access the funds necessary to develop economically attractive projects based on their expectations of future energy prices  required investments and resulting returns 
government regulations and the costs incurred by oil and natural gas exploration companies to conform to and comply with government regulations  may also limit the quantity of oil and natural gas that may be economically produced 
supply can be interrupted by a number of factors including political instability  civil unrest  labor issues  terrorist attacks  war or military activity 
key oil producing countries which could be subject to supply interruptions include  but are not limited to  saudi arabia  iran  iraq and other middle eastern countries  nigeria  norway  russia and venezuela 
the impact of supply disruptions on oil and natural gas prices and oil and natural gas price volatility is tempered by the size and expected duration of the disruption relative to the spare productive capacity at the time of the disruption 
supply can also be impacted by the degree to which individual organization of petroleum exporting countries opec nations and other large oil and natural gas producing countries  including  but not limited to  norway and russia  are willing and able to control production and exports of oil  to decrease or increase supply and to support their targeted oil price while meeting their market share objectives 
any of these factors could affect the supply of oil and natural gas and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
spare productive capacity and future demand impact our operations 
oil and natural gas storage inventory levels are an indicator of the relative balance between supply and demand 
high or increasing storage or inventories generally indicate that supply is exceeding demand and that energy prices are likely to soften 
low or decreasing storage or inventories are an indicator that demand is growing faster than supply and that energy prices are likely to rise 
measures of maximum productive capacity compared to demand spare productive capacity are also an important factor influencing energy prices and spending by oil and natural gas exploration companies 
when spare productive capacity is low compared to demand  energy prices tend to be higher and more volatile reflecting the increased vulnerability of the entire system to disruption 
seasonal and adverse weather conditions adversely affect demand for our services and operations 
weather can also have a significant impact on demand as consumption of energy is seasonal and any variation from normal weather patterns  cooler or warmer summers and winters  can have a significant impact on demand 
adverse weather conditions  such as hurricanes in the gulf of mexico  may interrupt or curtail our operations  or our customers operations  cause supply disruptions and result in a loss of revenue and damage to our equipment and facilities  which may or may not be insured 

table of contents risk factors related to our business our expectations regarding our business are affected by the following risk factors and the timing of any of these risk factors we operate in a highly competitive environment  which may adversely affect our ability to succeed 
we operate in a highly competitive environment for marketing oilfield services and securing equipment and trained personnel 
our ability to continually provide competitive products and services can impact our ability to maintain or increase prices for our products and services  maintain market share and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers 
in order to be competitive  we must provide new technologies  and reliable products and services that perform as expected and that create value for our customers 
our ability to maintain or increase prices for our products and services is in part dependent on the industry s capacity relative to customer demand  and on our ability to differentiate the value delivered by our products and services from our competitor s products and services 
in addition  our ability to negotiate acceptable contract terms and conditions with our customers  especially state owned national oil companies  our ability to manage warranty claims and our ability to effectively manage our commercial agents can also impact our results of operations 
managing development of competitive technology and new product introductions on a forecasted schedule and at forecasted costs can impact our financial results 
development of competing technology that accelerates the obsolescence of any of our products or services can have a detrimental impact on our financial results and can result in the potential impairment of long lived assets 
we may be disadvantaged competitively and financially by a significant movement of exploration and production operations to areas of the world in which we are not currently active 
the high cost or unavailability of materials  equipment  supplies and personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our operations on a timely basis 
our manufacturing operations are dependent on having sufficient raw materials  component parts and manufacturing capacity available to meet our manufacturing plans at a reasonable cost while minimizing inventories 
our ability to effectively manage our manufacturing operations and meet these goals can have an impact on our business  including our ability to meet our manufacturing plans and revenue goals  control costs and avoid shortages of raw materials and component parts 
raw materials and components of particular concern include steel alloys  copper  carbide  chemicals and electronic components 
our ability to repair or replace equipment damaged or lost in the well can also impact our ability to service our customers 
a lack of manufacturing capacity could result in increased backlog  which may limit our ability to respond to short lead time orders 
people are a key resource to developing  manufacturing and delivering our products and services to our customers around the world 
our ability to manage the recruiting  training and retention of the highly skilled workforce required by our plans and to manage the associated costs could impact our business 
a well trained  motivated work force has a positive impact on our ability to attract and retain business 
rapid growth presents a challenge to us and our industry to recruit  train and retain our employees while managing the impact of wage inflation and potential lack of available qualified labor in the markets where we operate 
labor related actions  including strikes  slowdowns and facility occupations can also have a negative impact on our business 
compliance with and changes in laws and regulations and risks from investigations and legal proceedings could be costly and could adversely affect operating results 
our operations in the us and over countries can be impacted by expected and unexpected changes in the legal and business environments in which we operate  as well as the outcome of ongoing government and internal investigations and legal proceedings such as the previously reported investigations by the securities and exchange commission sec and the department of justice doj 
our ability to manage our compliance costs will impact our ability to meet our earnings goals 
while we have reserved our best estimate of the financial charge related to the resolution of the investigations with the sec and doj regarding the investigations into our activities in angola  kazakhstan  and nigeria  there is no assurance that we will be able to reach an acceptable settlement and that the settlement will be approved by the appropriate us district court 
if we do not reach a negotiated settlement with the sec or the doj  it is likely that the sec and or doj will seek civil and criminal sanctions against us as well as fines and penalties that may be in excess of the current estimated reserved amount 
in addition  we may incur additional costs arising from compliance and ongoing or additional investigations in any of the countries where we do business 
changes that could impact the legal environment include new legislation  new regulation  new policies  investigations and legal proceedings and new interpretations of the existing legal rules and regulations  in particular  changes in export control laws or exchange control laws  additional restrictions on doing business in countries subject to sanctions  and changes in laws in countries 
table of contents where we operate or intend to operate 
changes that impact the business environment include changes in accounting standards  changes in environmental laws  changes in tax laws or tax rates  the resolution of tax assessments or audits by various tax authorities  and the ability to fully utilize our tax loss carryforwards and tax credits 
additional taxes may also be incurred or assessed as a result of any resolution with the sec and doj 
compliance related issues could limit our ability to do business in certain countries 
these changes could have a significant financial impact on our future operations and the way we conduct  or if we conduct  business in the affected countries 
uninsured claims and litigation could adversely impact our operating results 
we have insurance coverage against operating hazards  including product liability claims and personal injury claims related to our products  to the extent deemed prudent by our management and to the extent insurance is available  however  no assurance can be given that the nature and amount of that insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities arising out of pending and future claims and litigation 
this insurance has deductibles or self insured retentions and contains certain coverage exclusions 
the insurance does not cover damages from breach of contract by us or based on alleged fraud or deceptive trade practices 
whenever possible  we obtain agreements from customers that limit our liability 
insurance and customer agreements do not provide complete protection against losses and risks  and our results of operations could be adversely affected by unexpected claims not covered by insurance 
compliance with and rulings and litigation in connection with environmental regulations may adversely affect our business and operating results 
our business is impacted by unexpected outcomes or material changes in environmental liability 
changes in our environmental liability could originate with the discovery of new environmental remediation sites  changes in environmental regulations  or the discharge of hazardous materials into the environment 
changes in economic conditions and currency fluctuations may adversely affect our operating results 
fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar can impact our costs of doing business 
most of our products and services are sold through contracts denominated in us dollars or local currency indexed to us dollars 
local expenses and some of our manufacturing costs are incurred in local currencies and therefore changes in the exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies  particularly the british pound sterling  euro  canadian dollar  norwegian krone  venezuelan bolivar  australian dollar and brazilian real  can increase or decrease our expenses reported in us dollars and impact our operating margins 
a number of our significant foreign subsidiaries have designated the local currency as their functional currency and  as such  gains and losses resulting from balance sheet translation of foreign operations are included as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders equity 
gains and losses from foreign currency transactions  such as those resulting from the settlement of receivables or payables in the non functional currency  are included in the consolidated statements of operations as incurred 
for those foreign subsidiaries that have designated the us dollar as the functional currency  gains and losses resulting from balance sheet translation of foreign operations are also included in the consolidated statements of operations as incurred 
such transaction and translation losses may adversely impact our results of operations 
the condition of the capital markets and equity markets in general can affect the price of our common stock and our ability to obtain financing  if necessary 
if the company s credit rating is downgraded  this would increase our costs under our million revolving credit agreement  as well as the cost of obtaining  or make it more difficult to obtain or issue  new debt financing 
our ability to forecast the size of and changes in the worldwide oil and natural gas industry and our ability to forecast our customers activity levels and demand for our products and services impacts our management of our manufacturing and distribution activities  our staffing levels and our cash and financing requirements 
unanticipated changes in our customers requirements can impact our costs  creating temporary shortages or surpluses of equipment and people and demands for cash or financing 
changes in market conditions may impact any stock repurchases 
to the extent the company engages in stock repurchases  such activity is subject to market conditions  such as the trading prices for our stock  as well as the terms of any stock purchase plans intended to comply with rule b or rule b of the exchange act 
management in its discretion may engage in or discontinue stock repurchases at any time

item properties we are headquartered in houston  texas and operate principal manufacturing plants  ranging in size from approximately  to  square feet of manufacturing space 
the total area of the plants is approximately million square feet  of which approximately million square feet are located in the united states  million square feet are located in canada and south america  million square feet are located in europe  and a minimal amount of space is located in the far east 
our principal manufacturing plants are located in united states houston  texas  broken arrow and claremore  oklahoma  lafayette  louisiana  south america various cities in venezuela  and europe aberdeen and east kilbride  scotland  liverpool  england  celle  germany  belfast  northern ireland 
we own or lease numerous service centers  shops and sales and administrative offices throughout the geographic areas in which we operate

we believe that our manufacturing facilities are well maintained and suitable for their intended purposes 
the table below shows our principal manufacturing plants by segment and geographic area canada and segment united states south america europe far east total completion and production drilling and evaluation item legal proceedings we are involved in litigation or proceedings that have arisen in our ordinary business activities 
we insure against these risks to the extent deemed prudent by our management and to the extent insurance is available  but no assurance can be given that the nature and amount of that insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities arising out of pending and future legal proceedings 
many of these insurance policies contain deductibles or self insured retentions in amounts we deem prudent and for which we are responsible for payment 
in determining the amount of self insurance  it is our policy to self insure those losses that are predictable  measurable and recurring in nature  such as claims for automobile liability  general liability and workers compensation 
we record accruals for the uninsured portion of losses related to these types of claims 
the accruals for losses are calculated by estimating losses for claims using historical claim data  specific loss development factors and other information as necessary 
on september   we  without admitting or denying the factual allegations contained in the order  consented with the securities and exchange commission sec to the entry of an order making findings and imposing a cease and desist order the order for violations of section b a and section b b of the exchange act 
among the findings included in the order were the following in  we discovered that certain of our officers had authorized an improper  payment to an indonesian tax official  after which we embarked on a corrective course of conduct  including voluntarily and promptly disclosing the misconduct to the sec and the department of justice the doj 
in the course of our investigation of the indonesia matter  we learned that we had made payments in the amount of  and  in india and brazil  respectively  to our agents  without taking adequate steps to ensure that none of the payments would be passed on to foreign government officials 
the order found that the foregoing payments violated section b a 
the order also found us in violation of section b b because we did not have a system of internal controls to determine if payments violated the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa 
the fcpa makes it unlawful for us issuers  including us  or anyone acting on their behalf  to make improper payments to any foreign official in order to obtain or retain business 
in addition  as discussed below  the fcpa establishes accounting and internal control requirements for us issuers 
we cooperated with the sec s investigation 
by the order  dated september  previously disclosed by us and incorporated by reference in this annual report as exhibit  we agreed to cease and desist from committing or causing any violation and any future violation of section b a and section b b of the exchange act 
such sections of the exchange act require issuers to x make and keep books  records and accounts  which  in reasonable detail  accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the issuer and y devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that i transactions are executed in accordance with management s general or specific authorization  and ii transactions are recorded as necessary i to

on march   we announced that we had been advised that the sec and the doj are conducting investigations into allegations of violations of law relating to nigeria and other related matters 
the sec has issued a formal order of investigation into possible violations of provisions under the fcpa regarding anti bribery  books and records and internal controls 
the sec has issued subpoenas seeking information about our operations in angola subpoena dated august  and kazakhstan subpoenas dated august  and april  as part of its ongoing investigation 
we are providing documents to and cooperating fully with the sec and doj 
the doj and the sec have issued subpoenas to  or otherwise asked for interviews with  current and former employees in connection with the investigations regarding nigeria  angola and kazakhstan 
in addition  we have conducted internal investigations into these matters 
our internal investigations have identified issues regarding the propriety of certain payments and apparent deficiencies in our books and records and internal controls with respect to certain operations in nigeria  angola and kazakhstan  as well as potential liabilities to governmental authorities in nigeria 
the investigation in nigeria was substantially completed during the first quarter of and  based upon current information  we do not expect that any such potential liabilities will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
the internal investigations in angola and kazakhstan were substantially completed in the third quarter of evidence obtained during the course of the investigations has been provided to the sec and doj 
in  we received a subpoena from a grand jury in the southern district of new york regarding goods and services we delivered to iraq from through during the united nations oil for food program 
in  we also received a request from the sec to provide a written statement and certain information regarding our participation in that program 
we have responded to both the subpoena and the request and may provide additional materials 
the doj  the sec and other agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal sanctions they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals in appropriate circumstances including  but not limited to  injunctive relief  disgorgement  fines  penalties and modifications to business practices and compliance programs 
such agencies and authorities have entered into agreements with  and obtained a range of sanctions against  several public corporations and individuals arising from allegations of improper payments and deficiencies in books and records and internal controls  whereby civil and criminal penalties were imposed  including in some cases multi million dollar fines and other sanctions 
the company has engaged in settlement discussions with both the doj and sec concerning the issues in nigeria  angola and kazakhstan 
there can be no assurance that such discussions will result in a resolution of any or all of these issues  however  we have determined that the settlement discussions are likely to result in a resolution that will include both civil and criminal sanctions as well as significant fines and penalties 
our best estimate of the associated financial charge of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of and is included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
if a resolution is not concluded  we believe it is probable that the doj and sec will seek civil and criminal sanctions against us as well as fines and penalties 
if ultimately imposed  or if agreed to by settlement  such fines and penalties may exceed the current amount we have estimated and reserved 
it is not possible to accurately predict at this time when any of the investigations will be finally resolved
