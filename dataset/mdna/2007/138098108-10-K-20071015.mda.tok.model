overview cantel is a leading provider of infection prevention and control products in the healthcare market  specializing in the following operating segments dialysis medical device reprocessing systems  sterilants disinfectants  dialysate concentrates and other supplies for renal dialysis 
healthcare disposables formerly known as dental single use  infection control products used principally in the dental market including face masks  towels and bibs  tray covers  saliva ejectors  germicidal wipes  plastic cups  sterilization pouches and disinfectants 
water purification and filtration water purification equipment and services  filtration and separation products  and disinfectants for the medical  pharmaceutical  biotech  beverage and commercial industrial markets 
endoscope reprocessing medical device reprocessing systems and sterilants disinfectants for endoscopy 
therapeutic filtration hollow fiber membrane filtration and separation technologies for medical applications 
included in all other reporting segment specialty packaging specialty packaging and thermal control products  as well as related compliance training  for the transport of infectious and biological specimens and thermally sensitive pharmaceutical  medical and other products 
included in all other reporting segment most of our equipment  consumables and supplies are used to help prevent the occurrence or spread of infections 
to be more consistent with our strategy to expand our product offerings outside the dental market  we have renamed our dental operating segment to the healthcare disposables operating segment 
this change in segment description has no impact upon any reported financial information of this segment 
significant activity i in connection with our decision to not renew olympus exclusive united states distribution agreement when it expired on august   we commenced the sale and service of our medivators endoscope reprocessing equipment  high level disinfectants  cleaners and consumables through our own united states field sales and service organization on august   as more fully described elsewhere in this md a  risk factors and note to the consolidated financial statements 
the operating performance of our endoscope reprocessing business was adversely impacted during fiscal  compared with fiscal  by unabsorbed infrastructure costs associated with the start up of the medivators direct sales and service effort in the united states and the overall integration including material  overhead and warranty costs of our mds product line formerly known as dyped manufactured in the netherlands  including delays in the development and launch of this product line 
ii the dialysis industry has undergone significant consolidation  which adversely impacted sales volume and average selling prices of some of our dialysis products  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a and in risk factors 
we believe that the majority of the adverse impact of this consolidation on our operating results has already occurred 
iii distributors of our dental products have undergone consolidation during fiscal  which adversely impacted sales of our healthcare disposables segment in our fourth quarter due to rationalization of duplicate inventories in the consolidated companies 
we cannot predict what impact consolidation in this industry will have on future sales of our healthcare disposable products 
iv fiscal acquisitions we acquired ge water process technologies water dialysis business the ge water acquisition or ge water on march  and twist it inc twist on july   as more fully described in business recent events and note to the consolidated financial statements 
v on each of march and may   we amended our existing revolving credit facility  as more fully discussed elsewhere in this md a and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
vi a stronger canadian dollar and euro against the united states dollar impacted our results of operations during fiscal  compared with fiscal  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a 
the increase in values of the canadian dollar and euro were approximately and  respectively  compared with fiscal  based upon average exchange rates reported by banking institutions 
vii post fiscal acquisitions subsequent to july   we acquired dialysis services  inc dsi on august   verimetrix  llc verimetrix on september   and strong dental  inc strong dental on september   as more fully described in business recent events and note to the consolidated financial statements 
viii fiscal acquisitions we acquired crosstex international inc crosstex on august  and fluid solutions  inc fsi on may   as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
ix the olympus distribution agreements with carsen  as well as carsen s active business operations  terminated on july   as more fully described elsewhere in this md a and note to the consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  carsen is reported as a discontinued operation for all years presented 
results of operations the results of operations reflect the continuing operating results of cantel and its wholly owned subsidiaries  but exclude the operating results of carsen 
since the ge water acquisition was completed on march   its results of operations are included in our results of operations for the portion of fiscal subsequent to march  and are excluded from our results of operations for all other periods presented 
additionally  the july  twist acquisition had an insignificant affect on our results of operations for fiscal due to both the small size of this business as well as its inclusion for only a portion of one month  and its results of operations are excluded for all prior periods 
since the acquisitions of dsi  verimetrix and strong dental were consummated after the end of fiscal  the results of operations of these acquisitions are not included in our results of operations for any of the periods presented 
for fiscal compared with fiscal  discussion herein of our pre existing business refers to all of our reporting segments with the exception of the operating results of the ge water acquisition included in our water purification and filtration reporting segment  as well as the discontinued operations of carsen 
since the crosstex acquisition occurred on august   crosstex is reflected in our results of operations for fiscal and fiscal  and is not reflected in our results of operations for fiscal for fiscal compared with fiscal  discussion herein of our pre existing business refers to all of our reporting segments with the exception of healthcare disposables since this entire reporting segment is related to the crosstex acquisition  as well as the discontinued operations of carsen 
the following table gives information as to the net sales from continuing operations and the percentage to the total net sales from continuing operations for each of our reporting segments 
year ended july  dollar amounts in thousands dialysis healthcare disposables water purification and filtration endoscope reprocessing all other fiscal compared with fiscal net sales net sales increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal net sales of our pre existing business increased by  or  to  in fiscal compared with fiscal net sales contributed by the ge water acquisition in fiscal were  net sales were positively impacted in fiscal compared with fiscal by approximately  due to the translation of euro net sales primarily of our endoscope reprocessing and dialysis operating segments using a stronger euro against the united states dollar 
in addition  net sales were positively impacted in fiscal compared with fiscal by approximately  due to the translation of canadian dollar net sales primarily of our water purification and filtration operating segment using a stronger canadian dollar against the united states dollar 
the increase in net sales of our pre existing business in fiscal was principally attributable to increases in sales of endoscope reprocessing products and services  water purification and filtration products and services  healthcare disposable products  specialty packaging products and therapeutic filtration products 
net sales of endoscope reprocessing products and services increased by in fiscal  compared with fiscal  primarily due to an increase in selling prices of our medivators endoscope reprocessing equipment and related products and service in the united states as a result of selling directly to our customers and not through a distributor  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a  and an increase in demand for our endoscope disinfection equipment in europe and disinfectants and product service both in the united states and internationally 
the increase in demand for our disinfectants and product service is attributable to the increased field population of equipment and our ability to convert users of competitive disinfectants to our products 
the increase in customer prices as a result of the direct sales effort increased sales by approximately  in fiscal  compared with fiscal net sales of water purification and filtration products and services from our pre existing business increased by in fiscal  compared with fiscal  primarily due to the acquisition of fluid solutions on may   which contributed approximately  of incremental net sales in fiscal in early fiscal  a decision was made to refocus the consumer and industrial large capital portion of the water purification and filtration equipment business by eliminating contracts with low profitability  as such  revenue growth in this segment for the total year was moderated by this activity 
net sales of healthcare disposable products increased by in fiscal  compared with fiscal  primarily due to increased demand in the united states for our face masks and instrument sterilization pouches  and increases in selling prices of approximately  such selling price increases were implemented to offset corresponding supplier cost increases and therefore did not have a significant impact on gross profit 
net sales contributed by the specialty packaging operating segment were  an increase of  in fiscal compared with fiscal this increase in sales was primarily due to increased customer demand in the united states for our specialty packaging and compliance training products and increases in selling prices of approximately  there can be no assurance that the sales growth of specialty packaging products in fiscal will be comparable with fiscal net sales contributed by the therapeutic filtration operating segment were  an increase of  in fiscal compared with fiscal the increase in sales in fiscal was primarily due to an increase in demand internationally for our hemoconcentrator products a device used to concentrate red blood cells and remove excess fluid from the bloodstream during open heart surgery and the recommencement of sales of filters manufactured by us on an oem basis for a single customer s hydration system 
this customer had previously experienced a voluntary recall of the system unrelated to our product and was not purchasing filters until their sales of hydration systems recommenced  there can be no assurance that future sales of such filters will continue at current levels 
sales of dialysis products and services in fiscal were comparable with fiscal such sales decreased primarily due to lower average selling prices for renalin sterilant and renatron equipment due to increased sales to large national chains that typically receive more favorable pricing  and reduced demand for renalin sterilant domestically primarily due to the acquisition of renal care group rcg by fresenius medical care fresenius  as discussed below 
offsetting this decrease was an increase in customer demand for renatron equipment  both in the united states and internationally  and dialysate concentrate a concentrated acid or bicarbonate used to prepare dialysate  a chemical solution that draws waste products from a patient s blood through a dialyzer membrane during hemodialysis treatment internationally partially offset by decreased demand for concentrate in the united states  as well as an increase of approximately  in net sales as a result of shipping and handling fees  such as freight  invoiced to customers in fiscal related costs of a similar amount are included within cost of sales 
the majority of this amount related to two of our larger customers who were previously responsible for transportation related to the products they purchased from us  during fiscal  we became responsible for the transportation and invoiced them for such costs 
the dialysis industry has undergone significant consolidation through the acquisition by certain major dialysis chains of other major chains  as well as smaller chains and independents 
in october  davita inc davita  the second largest dialysis chain in the united states  acquired gambro ab s united states dialysis clinic business  gambro healthcare  inc gambro us 
davita gambro us are significant customers of our dialysis reuse products and accounted for approximately and of our dialysis net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
the davita gambro us acquisition has resulted in greater buying power for the larger resulting entity and thereby a reduction in our net sales and profit margins due to reduced average selling prices of our dialyzer reprocessing products beginning in november  however  offsetting this reduction is increased demand for our renatron equipment and renalin sterilant from davita gambro in fiscal  as compared with fiscal in addition  on march   fresenius  the largest dialysis chain in the united states and a provider of single use dialyzer products  completed its acquisition of rcg  which was a significant customer of our dialysis reuse products 
combined net sales of fresenius and rcg accounted for approximately and of our dialysis net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
we believe fresenius has converted most of the dialysis clinics of rcg into single use facilities  which has adversely affected our sales of reuse dialysis products 
in addition  the fresenius acquisition has resulted in the loss of low margin concentrate business to the rcg dialysis centers since fresenius manufactures dialysate concentrate 
we believe that the majority of the adverse impact of these acquisitions has already occurred and is therefore reflected in the operating results of our dialysis segment for the last nine months of fiscal gross profit gross profit increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal gross profit of our pre existing business increased by  or  to  in fiscal compared with fiscal gross profit contributed by the ge water acquisition for the four month period ended july  was  since the date of the acquisition 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscal and was and  respectively 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales of our pre existing business in fiscal was 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the ge water acquisition for the four month period ended july  was since the date of the acquisition 
the higher gross profit percentage of our pre existing business in fiscal  compared with fiscal  was primarily attributable to an increase in gross profit percentage on our dialysis products due to i an improvement in both customer and product mix related to our dialysate concentrate product  which improvements resulted from the fresenius acquisition of rcg and our strategy of only maintaining concentrate business with an acceptable gross margin  ii lower manufacturing costs including the closing of a distribution center and iii more favorable transportation costs due to new freight arrangements with certain customers 
the increase in gross profit percentage was also attributable to selling our medivators brand endoscope reprocessing equipment  high level disinfectants  cleaners and consumables directly to customers through our own united states field sales and service organization instead of through a distributor  increases in sales of higher margin healthcare disposable products  such as our face masks and instrument sterilization pouches  and specialty packaging products  and the non reoccurrence of a  one time purchase accounting charge related to our healthcare disposables segment s inventory incurred during the first quarter of fiscal partially offsetting these increases in gross profit percentage were a lower gross profit percentage due to i mds integration costs including material  overhead and warranty costs and increased international sales of our low margin mds product line of endoscope reprocessing equipment  ii endoscope reprocessing services primarily due to a low level of billable time for our newly developed us field service organization since most machines sold directly to our customers under our new direct sales and service strategy are still under warranty and iii water purification and filtration products and services primarily due to unabsorbed manufacturing overhead  as well as the sale of water purification equipment at lower than normal margins due to start up costs of a new line of machines 
with respect to the increase in gross profit as opposed to gross profit percentage  increases in net sales as explained above  as well as the aforementioned reasons for the increase in gross profit percentage  constitute the most significant factors in the increase in gross profit 
operating expenses selling expenses increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal principally due to a higher cost structure of approximately  for our endoscope reprocessing direct sales network as a result of our decision to not renew olympus exclusive united states distribution agreement when it expired on august   the inclusion of approximately  of selling expenses related to the acquisitions of ge water and fluid solutions  an increase in advertising and marketing expense primarily related to our healthcare disposables and endoscope reprocessing segments  and an increase in compensation expense primarily due to additional sales and marketing personnel in our specialty packaging and healthcare disposables segments 
selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal compared with in fiscal the increase in selling expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to a higher cost structure for our endoscope reprocessing direct sales network as a result of our decision to not renew olympus exclusive united states distribution agreement when it expired on august  general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to  in fiscal  from  in fiscal principally due to increased compensation expense  including additional personnel  of approximately  the inclusion of approximately  of expenses related to the acquisitions of ge water and fluid solutions  increased accounting and other professional fees including executive transition expenses of approximately  an increase in stock based compensation expense of   in higher medical insurance costs  and  in incentive compensation directly related to the ge water acquisition 
partially offsetting these increases were the non reoccurrences of  in incentive compensation directly related to the crosstex acquisition and  in debt financing costs related to our amended and restated credit facilities  both of which charges were incurred during the first three months of fiscal general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal  compared with in fiscal research and development expenses which include continuing engineering costs were  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
the majority of our research and development expenses related to our mds endoscope reprocessor and specialty filtration products 
the decrease in research and development expense in fiscal  compared with fiscal  is due to less development work on the european version of our mds endoscope reprocessor 
interest interest expense decreased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily due a decrease in average outstanding borrowings  partially offset by an increase in average interest rates 
interest expense specifically related to the financing of the ge water acquisition was  since the date of the acquisition 
interest income decreased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily due to a decrease in average cash and cash equivalents partially offset by an increase in average interest rates 
income from continuing operations before taxes income from continuing operations before income taxes increased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal income taxes the consolidated effective tax rate was and for fiscal and  respectively 
our results of continuing operations for fiscal and reflect income tax expense for our united states  canada and japan operations at their respective statutory rates  which rates in fiscal were  and  respectively 
however  only a partial tax benefit was recorded in fiscal and at our netherlands subsidiary  thereby causing our overall effective tax rate to exceed statutory rates 
the decrease in the overall effective tax rate for fiscal  compared with fiscal  was principally due to the geographic mix of pretax income  particularly in our fourth quarter of this decrease was also attributable to a reduction in the statutory united states tax rate to in fiscal  compared with in fiscal in fiscal  we believe our consolidated effective tax rate will be approximately 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin no 

fin no 
clarifies the accounting and reporting for uncertainties in income tax law 
fin no 
prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns 
fin no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and therefore is effective for our fiscal year we are assessing the impact of the adoption of fin and currently do not believe that the adoption will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
stock based compensation on august   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment revised sfas r using the modified prospective method for the transition 
under the modified prospective method  stock based compensation expense will be recognized for any option grant or stock award granted on or after august   as well as the unvested portion of stock options granted prior to august   based upon the award s fair value 
for fiscal and earlier periods  we have accounted for stock options using the intrinsic value method under which stock compensation expense is not recognized because we granted stock options with exercise prices equal to the market value of the shares at the date of grant 
the following table shows the allocation of total stock based compensation expense relating to continuing operations recognized in the consolidated statements of income year ended july  cost of sales operating expenses selling general and administrative research and development total operating expenses discontinued operations stock based compensation before income taxes income tax benefits total stock based compensation expense  net of tax in fiscal and  the above stock based compensation expense before income taxes was recorded in the consolidated financial statements as stock based compensation expense which decreased both basic and diluted earnings per share from net income by and in fiscal and  respectively and an increase to additional capital 
the related income tax benefits which pertain only to stock awards and options that do not qualify as incentive stock options were recorded as an increase to long term deferred income tax assets which are netted with long term deferred income tax liabilities or a reduction to income taxes payable  depending on the timing of the deduction  and a reduction to income tax expense 
the stock based compensation expense recorded in our consolidated financial statements may not be representative of the effect of stock based compensation expense in future periods due to the level of awards issued in past years which level may not be similar in the future  assumptions used in determining fair value  and estimated forfeitures 
we determine the fair value of each unvested stock award using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
we estimate the fair value of each option grant on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
the determination of fair value using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the expected option life which is determined by using the historical closing prices of our common stock  the expected dividend yield which is expected to be  and the expected option life which is based on historical exercise behavior 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  the compensation expense that we would record under sfas r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
with respect to stock options granted during the last nine months of fiscal  we reassessed both the expected option life and stock price volatility assumptions by evaluating more recent historical exercise behavior and stock price activity  such reevaluation resulted in reductions in both the expected option lives and volatility 
most of our stock option and nonvested stock awards are subject to graded vesting in which portions of the award vest at different times during the vesting period  as opposed to awards that vest at the end of the vesting period 
we recognize compensation expense for awards subject to graded vesting using the straight line basis  reduced by estimated forfeitures 
at july   total unrecognized stock based compensation expense  net of tax  related to total nonvested stock options and stock awards was  with a remaining weighted average period of months over which such expense is expected to be recognized 
such unrecognized stock based compensation expense increased in fiscal  compared with fiscal  due to additional employee stock option and nonvested stock grants 
upon exercise of stock options or grant of nonvested shares  we typically issue new shares of our common stock as opposed to using treasury shares 
if certain criteria are met when options are exercised or the underlying shares are sold  the company is allowed a deduction on its income tax return 
accordingly  we account for the income tax effect on such income tax deductions as additional capital assuming deferred tax assets do not exist pertaining to the exercised stock options and as a reduction of income taxes payable 
in fiscal and  options exercised resulted in income tax deductions that reduced income taxes payable by  and  respectively 
at july  prior to the adoption of sfas r  we presented all tax benefits of deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options as operating cash flows in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
beginning august   we changed our cash flow presentation in accordance with sfas r  which requires the cash flows resulting from excess tax benefits to be classified as financing cash flows 
excess tax benefits arise when the ultimate tax effect of the deduction for tax purposes is greater than the tax benefit on stock compensation expense including tax benefits on stock compensation expense that has only been reflected in the pro forma disclosures which was determined based upon the award s fair value 
in fiscal  we accelerated the vesting of certain unvested and out of the money stock options previously awarded to certain executive officers and other employees individuals in total under our employee stock option plan 
such options had exercise prices greater than  the closing price on june   the date that our board of directors authorized such acceleration 
options to purchase  shares of common stock of which approximately  shares are subject to options held by executive officers were subject to this acceleration 
all other terms and conditions of the options remain in effect 
options held by non employee directors were not included in the acceleration 
because these options had exercise prices in excess of the market value of cantel common stock on june   and therefore were not fully achieving our original objectives of incentive compensation and employee retention  we believe the acceleration may have had a positive effect on employee morale  retention and perception of option value 
the acceleration eliminated any future compensation expense we would otherwise recognize in our income statement with respect to these options with the august  implementation of sfas r 
the compensation expense  after tax  related to this acceleration totaled approximately  if such acceleration did not occur  we would have recognized additional compensation expense  net of tax  of approximately    and  in fiscal   and  respectively  based on the fair value of the options granted at grant date over the original vesting period 
fiscal compared with fiscal net sales net sales increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal net sales of our pre existing business increased by  or  to  for fiscal compared with fiscal net sales contributed by our healthcare disposables segment in fiscal were  net sales were positively impacted in fiscal compared with fiscal by approximately  due to the translation of canadian dollar net sales primarily of our water purification and filtration operating segment using a stronger canadian dollar against the united states dollar 
in addition  net sales were negatively impacted in fiscal compared with fiscal by approximately  due to the translation of euro net sales primarily of our dialysis operating segment using a weaker euro against the united states dollar 
increases in selling prices of our products did not have a significant effect on net sales in fiscal however  as discussed below  we experienced a reduction in our dialysis net sales and profit margins in fiscal due to reduced average selling prices attributable to the davita gambro us acquisition 
the increase in net sales of our pre existing business in fiscal was principally attributable to increases in sales of water purification and filtration products and services and endoscope reprocessing products and services 
these increases in net sales were partially offset by decreases in sales of dialysis products and therapeutic products 
the increase in sales of water purification and filtration products and services of  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily due to increased demand in north america for our water purification and filtration equipment  and was partially attributable to the restructuring  strengthening  and consolidation of our sales and marketing organization 
additionally  we acquired certain of the assets and assumed certain of the liabilities of fluid solutions  inc on may  which resulted in approximately  of incremental net sales in fiscal the increase in sales of endoscope reprocessing products and services of in fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily due to an increase in demand for our endoscope disinfection equipment  disinfectants and product service both in the united states and internationally 
the increase in demand for our disinfectants and product service is attributable to the increased field population of equipment including our dyped endoscope disinfection equipment in europe and our ability to convert users of competitive disinfectants to our products 
sales of dialysis products and services decreased by in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to a decrease in demand from domestic and international customers for dialysate concentrate a concentrated acid or bicarbonate used to prepare dialysate  a chemical solution that draws waste products from a patient s blood through a dialyzer membrane during hemodialysis treatment and renatron dialyzer reprocessing equipment both in the united states and internationally  and lower average selling prices for renatron equipment and renalin sterilant due to increased sales to large national chains that typically receive more favorable pricing 
partially offsetting the decrease in sales of dialysis products and services was an increase of approximately  in net sales as a result of shipping and handling fees  such as freight  invoiced to customers during fiscal related costs of a similar amount are included within cost of sales 
during fiscal  two of our largest customers were responsible for transportation related to the products they purchased from us  in fiscal  these two customers requested that we undertake and invoice them for such transportation 
the dialysis industry has been undergoing significant consolidation through the acquisition by certain major dialysis chains of smaller chains and independents 
in october  davita  the second largest dialysis chain in the united states  acquired gambro ab s united states dialysis clinic business  gambro us 
davita gambro us are significant customers of our dialysis reuse products and accounted for approximately of our dialysis net sales during fiscal the davita gambro us acquisition has resulted in greater buying power for the larger resulting entity and thereby a reduction in our net sales and profit margins due to reduced average selling prices of our dialyzer reprocessing products 
in addition  on march   fresenius  the largest dialysis chain in the united states and a provider of single use dialyzer products  announced the closing of its acquisition of rcg 
rcg has been a significant customer of our dialysis reuse products 
combined net sales of fresenius and rcg accounted for approximately of our dialysis net sales during fiscal we anticipate fresenius will convert all or substantially all of the dialysis clinics of rcg into single use facilities  which will adversely affect our sales of dialysis products 
given the uncertainty of the post acquisition operating strategies for fresenius rcg  we are currently unable to determine the timing and impact on our future sales of dialysis products and services 
in addition  the davita and fresenius acquisitions have resulted in the loss of low margin dialysate concentrate business since gambro and fresenius manufacture dialysate concentrate themselves 
consequently  the davita and rcg dialysis centers have reduced their purchases of dialysate concentrate from us 
net sales contributed by the therapeutic filtration operating segment were  a decrease of  or in fiscal compared with fiscal this decrease in sales was primarily due to reduced sales in the united states of pediatric filters  manufactured by us on an oem basis for a single customer s hydration system  due to a voluntary recall of the system unrelated to our product by such customer 
we anticipate that sales to the manufacturer will recommence in the near future 
the reduction was also due to decreases in demand for our hemoconcentrator products a device used to concentrate red blood cells and remove excess fluid from the bloodstream during open heart surgery and hemofilter products a product that performs a slow  continuous blood filtration therapy used to control fluid overload and acute renal failure in unstable  critically ill patients who cannot tolerate the rapid filtration rates of conventional hemodialysis  both in the united states and internationally 
gross profit gross profit increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal gross profit of our pre existing business decreased by  or  to  in fiscal compared with fiscal gross profit contributed by our healthcare disposables segment in fiscal was  gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal compared with in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales of our pre existing business in fiscal was 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales for our healthcare disposables segment in fiscal was  which was adversely impacted by a  one time purchase accounting charge related to our healthcare disposables segment s inventory during the three months ended october  excluding this one time charge  gross profit as a percentage of net sales for our healthcare disposables segment in fiscal was the lower gross profit percentage from our pre existing business in fiscal as compared with fiscal was primarily attributable to a lower gross profit percentage on our dialysis products due to lower average selling prices on dialysate concentrate  renatron equipment and sterilants principally as a result of increased sales to large national chains that typically receive more favorable pricing  unfavorable overhead absorption associated with the decrease in sales to domestic and international customers  and higher distribution costs 
additionally  gross profit percentage for fiscal was adversely impacted by the sale of some large water purification and filtration systems at lower than normal margins 
with respect to the reduction in gross profit as opposed to gross profit percentage  the loss in gross profit attributable to decreases in net sales as explained above  as well as the aforementioned reasons for the reduction in gross profit percentage  constitute the most significant factors in the decrease in gross profit 
operating expenses selling expenses increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal principally due to the inclusion of  of our healthcare disposables segment s selling expenses  the initial cost of  to develop our endoscope reprocessing direct sales and service network as a result of our decision to not renew olympus exclusive united states distribution agreement when it expired on august   as more fully described elsewhere is this md a  an increase in salary expense of approximately  in our specialty packaging operating segment primarily for the increase in our sales and marketing personnel  the recording of  of stock based compensation expense in fiscal  and the translation of canadian expenses in our water purification and filtration and specialty packaging segments using a stronger canadian dollar against the united states dollar which resulted in an additional  of selling expenses 
partially offsetting the increase in selling expenses were decreases in sales and marketing personnel and commissions in our dialysis reporting segment in response to the consolidation of the dialysis industry since an increasing percentage of sales of our dialysis products are to major dialysis chains as compared to small chains and independent dialysis clinics 
selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal compared with in fiscal the decrease in selling expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the inclusion of the lower selling cost structure of our healthcare disposables segment which selling expenses as a percentage of our healthcare disposables segment net sales were in fiscal and decreases in sales and marketing personnel and commissions in our dialysis reporting segment in response to the consolidation of the dialysis industry  partially offset by the initial cost of  to develop our endoscope reprocessing direct field sales and service organization 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal principally due to the inclusion of  of our healthcare disposables segment s general and administrative expenses which expenses include  of amortization associated with intangible assets  the recording of  of stock based compensation expense in fiscal   in incentive compensation during the three months ended october  directly related to the crosstex acquisition  the translation of canadian expenses in our water purification and filtration and specialty packaging segments using a stronger canadian dollar against the united states dollar which resulted in an additional  of general and administrative expenses   in debt financing costs during the three months ended october  related to our amended and restated credit facilities  and the inclusion of  of fluid solution s general and administrative expenses for the three month period subsequent to the may  acquisition 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal compared with in fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the aforementioned factors 
research and development expenses which include continuing engineering costs increased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the majority of our research and development expenses related to our dyped endoscope reprocessor and specialty filtration products 
the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily due to ongoing research and development on those products 
interest in fiscal  interest expense increased by  to  from  in fiscal primarily due to the significant increase in average outstanding borrowings as a result of financing a portion of the purchase price of the august  acquisition of crosstex 
interest income increased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily due to an increase in average interest rates in fiscal and a higher average cash balance 
income from continuing operations before taxes income from continuing operations before income taxes decreased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal income taxes the consolidated effective tax rate was and for fiscal and  respectively 
we have provided income tax expense for our united states operations at the statutory tax rate  however  actual payment of us federal income taxes reflects the benefits of the utilization of the remaining federal net operating loss carryforwards nols accumulated in the united states 
our nols were fully utilized during the three months ended october  our results of continuing operations for fiscal and also reflect income tax expense for our international subsidiaries at their respective statutory rates 
such international subsidiaries include our subsidiaries in canada and japan  which had effective tax rates in fiscal of approximately and  respectively 
a partial income tax benefit was recorded in fiscal on the losses from operations at our netherlands subsidiary 
the higher overall effective tax rate for fiscal compared with fiscal is principally due to the geographic mix of pretax income  an increase in the statutory united states tax rate to from  an increase in our overall state income tax rate to approximately from due to the crosstex acquisition  losses related to our netherlands operation for which only a partial income tax benefit was recorded and stock based compensation during fiscal for which only a partial income tax benefit was recorded including our canadian operations in which no tax benefit was recorded  partially offset by the domestic production deduction resulting from the american jobs creation act of liquidity and capital resources working capital at july   our working capital was  compared with  at july  cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was   and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
with respect to continuing operations only  net cash provided by operating activities was   and  respectively 
in fiscal  the net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income after adjusting for depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation expense  and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses due to increased purchases in july to meet product demand and additional compensation as a result of more personnel  including the additional sales and service personnel of our endoscope reprocessing operating segment 
these items were partially offset by increases in i accounts receivable due to strong sales in the months of july and june  including sales related to the ge water acquisition  and increases in customer prices in our endoscope reprocessing operating segment as a result of the direct sales effort and ii inventories due to planned increases in stock levels of certain products and decreases in i net liabilities of discontinued operations due to the wind down of carsen s operations including substantial tax payments that were payable in fiscal and ii income taxes payable due to timing associated with payments

repurchase of shares on april   our board of directors approved the repurchase of up to  shares of our outstanding common stock 
under the repurchase program we repurchased shares from time to time at prevailing prices and as permitted by applicable securities laws including sec rule b and new york stock exchange requirements  and subject to market conditions 
the repurchase program had a one year term that expired on april  we repurchased  shares under the repurchase program at a total average price per share of 
of the  shares   shares were repurchased in fiscal discontinued operations termination of carsen s operations on july   carsen closed the sale of substantially all of its assets to olympus under an asset purchase agreement dated as of may  among carsen  cantel and olympus 
olympus purchased substantially all of carsen s assets other than those related to carsen s medivators business and certain other smaller product lines 
following the closing  olympus hired substantially all of carsen s employees and took over carsen s olympus related operations as well as the operations related to the other acquired product lines 
the transaction resulted in an after tax gain of  and was recorded separately on the consolidated statements of income for the year ended july  as gain on disposal of discontinued operations  net of tax 
in connection with the transaction  carsen s medivators related assets as well as certain of its other assets that were not acquired by olympus were sold to our new canadian distributor of medivators products 
the purchase price for the net assets sold to olympus was approximately  comprised of a fixed sum of  plus an additional formula based sum of  in addition  olympus paid carsen of olympus revenues attributable to carsen s unfilled customer orders backlog as of july  that were assumed by olympus at the closing 
such payments to carsen were made following olympus receipt of customer payments for such orders 
in fiscal  approximately  related to such backlog has been recorded as income and has been reported in income from discontinued operations  net of tax  in the consolidated statements of income 
the  fixed portion of the purchase price was in consideration for i carsen s customer lists  sales records  and certain other assets related to the sale and servicing of olympus products and certain non olympus products distributed by carsen  ii the release of olympus contractual restriction on hiring carsen personnel  iii real property leases which were assumed or replaced by olympus and leasehold improvements  computer and software systems  equipment and machinery  telephone systems  and records related to the acquired assets  and iv assisting olympus in effecting a smooth transition of carsen s business of distributing and servicing olympus and certain non olympus products in canada 
cantel has also agreed on behalf of itself and its affiliates not to manufacture  distribute  sell or represent for sale in canada through july  any products that are competitive with the olympus products formerly sold by carsen under its olympus distribution agreements 
net proceeds from carsen s sale of net assets and the termination of carsen s operations were approximately  excluding the backlog payments after satisfaction of remaining liabilities and taxes 
as a result of the foregoing transaction  which coincided with the expiration of carsen s exclusive distribution agreements with olympus on july   carsen no longer has any remaining product lines or active business operations 
cash flows attributable to discontinued operations comprise the following year ended july  net cash used in provided by operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities in fiscal  net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to the payment of carsen s remaining operating costs relating to fiscal  income tax payments and various wind down costs  partially offset by the collection of the remaining receivables 
at july   approximately  in liabilities remain  which primarily relate to various taxes expected to be paid in early fiscal as well as the repayment to olympus of an uncollected account receivable 
in fiscal  net cash provided by investing activities was due to proceeds from disposal of the discontinued operations 
in fiscal  net cash used in investing activities was due to capital expenditures 
financing activities of our discontinued operations did not result in any net cash in fiscal  and direct sale of medivators systems in the united states on august   we commenced the sale and service of our medivators brand endoscope reprocessing equipment  high level disinfectants  cleaners and consumables through our own united states field sales and service organization 
our direct sale of these products is the result of our decision that it is in our best long term interests to control and develop our own direct hospital based united states distribution network and  as such  not to renew olympus exclusive united states distribution agreement when it expired on august  throughout the former distribution arrangement with olympus  we employed our own personnel to provide clinical sales support activities as well as an internal technical and customer service function  depot maintenance and service and all logistics and distribution services for the medivators olympus customer base 
this existing and fully developed infrastructure will continue to be a critical factor in our new direct sales and service strategy 
during the seven year period following the expiration of the distribution agreement with olympus on august   olympus will have the option to provide certain ongoing support functions to its existing customer base of medivators products  subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement 
in addition  olympus may continue to purchase from minntech for resale in connection with such support functions  medivators accessories  consumables  and replacement and repair parts  as well as rapicide disinfectant 
during fiscal  olympus continued to purchase such items from us  although we have been gradually converting the sale of such items over to our direct sales and service force 
long term contractual obligations aggregate annual required payments over the next five years and thereafter under our contractual obligations that have long term components are as follows year ended july  amounts in thousands thereafter total maturities of the credit facilities expected interest payments under the credit facilities minimum commitments under noncancelable operating leases minimum commitments under noncancelable capital leases minimum commitments under license agreement note payable dyped deferred compensation and other employment agreements total contractual obligations the expected interest payments under the term and revolving credit facilities reflect interest rates of and  respectively  which were our interest rates on outstanding borrowings at july  the maturities of the credit facilities as well as the expected interest payments under the credit facilities do not reflect the additional borrowings of  occurring subsequent to july   which borrowings were principally related to the acquisitions of dsi  verimetrix and strong dental 
credit facilities in conjunction with the acquisition of crosstex  we entered into amended and restated credit facilities dated as of august  the us credit facilities with a consortium of lenders to fund the cash consideration paid in the acquisition and costs associated with the acquisition  as well as to modify our existing united states credit facilities 
in addition  we agreed to repay the july  outstanding borrowings of  under our original term loan facility within ninety days from the closing 
in october  such amount was repaid primarily through the repatriation of funds from our foreign subsidiaries 
amounts we repay under the term loan facility may not be re borrowed 
additionally  we incurred debt issuance costs of approximately  of which  of third party costs was recorded in general and administrative expenses during the three months ended october  in accordance with applicable accounting rules 
the remaining  of costs was recorded in other assets and is being amortized over the life of the credit facilities 
on march   we amended the us credit facilities primarily to allow for the ge water acquisition 
additionally  on may  we amended the us credit facilities principally to increase the borrowing capacity under the existing senior secured revolving credit facility as well as to obtain improved terms on interest margins applicable to our outstanding borrowings 
the us credit facilities  as amended  include i a six year million senior secured amortizing term loan facility and ii a five year million senior secured revolving credit facility 
at september   borrowings under the us credit facilities bear interest at rates ranging from to above the lender s base rate  or at rates ranging from to above the london interbank offered rate libor  depending upon our consolidated ratio of debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  and as further adjusted under the terms of the us credit facilities ebitda 
at september   the lender s base rate was and the libor rates ranged from to 
the margins applicable to our outstanding borrowings at september  were above the lender s base rate and above libor 
substantially all of our outstanding borrowings were under libor contracts at september  the us credit facilities also provide for fees on the unused portion of our revolving credit facility at rates ranging from to  depending upon our consolidated ratio of debt to ebitda  such rate was at september  the us credit facilities require us to meet certain financial covenants and are secured by i substantially all of our us based assets including assets of cantel  minntech  mar cor and crosstex and ii our pledge of all of the outstanding shares of minntech  mar cor and crosstex and of the outstanding shares of our foreign based subsidiaries 
additionally  we are not permitted to pay cash dividends on our common stock without the consent of our united states lenders 
as of july   we are in compliance with all financial and other covenants under the us credit facilities  as amended 
on july   we had  of outstanding borrowings under the us credit facilities which consisted of  and  under the term loan facility and the revolving credit facility  respectively 
subsequent to july   we borrowed an additional  under the revolving credit facility and repaid  under the term loan facility  therefore  at september   we had  of outstanding borrowings under the us credit facilities  including  and  under the term loan facility and the revolving credit facility  respectively 
operating leases minimum commitments under operating leases include minimum rental commitments for our leased manufacturing facilities  warehouses  office space and equipment 
rent expense related to operating leases for fiscal was recorded on a straight line basis and aggregated  compared with  and  for fiscal and  respectively  which excludes rent expense related to our discontinued operations 
dyped note payable and other long term liabilities in conjunction with the dyped acquisition on september   we issued a note with a face value of   using the exchange rate on the date of the acquisition 
at july   approximately  of this note was outstanding using the exchange rate on july  and is payable on july  such note is non interest bearing and has been recorded in accrued expenses at its present value of  at july  also included in other long term liabilities are deferred compensation arrangements for certain former minntech directors and officers 
license agreement on january   we entered into a license agreement with a third party which allows us to manufacture  use  import  sell and distribute certain thermal control products relating to our specialty packaging segment 
in consideration  we agreed to pay a minimum annual royalty payable each calendar year over the license agreement term of years 
at july   we had minimum future royalty obligations of approximately  relating to this license agreement 
financing needs at july   we had a cash balance of  of which  was held by foreign subsidiaries 
we believe that our current cash position  anticipated cash flows from operations  and the funds available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our cash operating requirements for the foreseeable future based upon our existing operations 
at september    was available under our united states revolving credit facility  as amended 
foreign currency during fiscal  compared with fiscal  the average value of the canadian dollar increased by approximately relative to the value of the united states dollar 
changes in the value of the canadian dollar against the united states dollar affect our results of operations because a portion of our canadian subsidiaries inventories and operating costs which are reported in the water purification and filtration and specialty packaging segments are purchased in the united states and a significant amount of their sales are to customers in the united states 
additionally  the financial statements of our canadian subsidiaries are translated using the accounting policies described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange between the united states and canada had an overall adverse impact in fiscal  compared with fiscal  upon our continuing results of operations of approximately  net of tax 
as of september  compared with july   the value of the canadian dollar has further increased by approximately relative to the value of the united states dollar 
during fiscal  compared with fiscal  the value of the euro increased by approximately relative to the value of the united states dollar 
changes in the value of the euro against the united states dollar affect our results of operations because a portion of the net assets of our netherlands subsidiary which are reported in our dialysis  endoscope reprocessing and water purification and filtration segments are denominated and ultimately settled in united states dollars but must be converted into its functional euro currency 
additionally  financial statements of our netherlands subsidiary are translated using the accounting policies described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange between the euro and the united states dollar had an overall adverse impact in fiscal  compared with fiscal  upon our results of operations of approximately  net of tax 
as of september  compared with july   the value of the euro has further increased by approximately relative to the value of the united states dollar 
in order to hedge against the impact of fluctuations in the value of the euro relative to the united states dollar on the conversion of such dollar denominated net assets into functional currency  we enter into short term contracts to purchase euros forward  which contracts are generally one month in duration 
these short term contracts are designated as fair value hedges 
there was one foreign currency forward contract amounting to  at august  which covers certain assets and liabilities of minntech s netherlands subsidiary which are denominated in united states dollars 
such contract expired on september  under our credit facilities  such contracts to purchase euros may not exceed  in an aggregate notional amount at any time 
during fiscal  such forward contracts were effective in offsetting the impact of the strengthening of the euro on certain assets and liabilities of minntech s netherlands subsidiary that are denominated in united states dollars 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 as amended  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  such foreign currency forward contracts are designated as hedges 
gains and losses related to these hedging contracts to buy euros forward are immediately realized within general and administrative expenses due to the short term nature of such contracts 
for purposes of translating the balance sheet at july  compared with july   the value of the canadian dollar increased by approximately and the value of the euro increased by approximately compared with the value of the united states dollar 
the total of these currency movements resulted in a foreign currency translation gain of  in fiscal  thereby increasing stockholders equity 
changes in the value of the japanese yen relative to the united states dollar during fiscal  compared with fiscal  did not have a significant impact upon either our results of operations or the translation of our balance sheet  primarily due to the fact that our japanese subsidiary accounts for a relatively small portion of consolidated net sales  net income and net assets 
inflation during fiscal we experienced higher materials  labor  and distribution costs compared with fiscal  which cost increases were in excess of the general rate of inflation 
we implemented price increases for certain of our products which partially offset these cost increases  however  some of our businesses primarily the dialysis and water purification and filtration segments were unable to obtain higher selling prices as more fully described in results of operations 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we continually evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue on product sales is recognized as products are shipped to customers and title passes 
the passing of title is determined based upon the fob terms specified for each shipment 
with respect to dialysis  therapeutic  specialty packaging and endoscope reprocessing products  shipment terms are generally fob origin for common carrier and fob destination when our distribution fleet is utilized except for one large customer in dialysis whereby all products are shipped fob destination 
with respect to water purification and filtration and healthcare disposable products  shipment terms may be either fob origin or destination 
customer acceptance for the majority of our product sales occurs at the time of delivery 
in certain instances  primarily with respect to some of our water purification and filtration equipment  endoscope reprocessing equipment and an insignificant amount of our sales of dialysis equipment  post delivery obligations such as installation  in servicing or training are contractually specified  in such instances  revenue recognition is deferred until all of such conditions have been substantially fulfilled such that the products are deemed functional by the end user 
with respect to a portion of water purification and filtration product sales  equipment is sold as part of a system for which the equipment is functionally interdependent or the customer s purchase order specifies ship complete as a condition of delivery  revenue recognition on such sales is deferred until all equipment has been delivered 
a portion of our water purification and filtration sales relating to our acquisition of ge water are recognized as multiple element arrangements  whereby revenue is allocated to the equipment and installation components based upon vendor specific objective evidence which principally includes comparable historical transactions of similar equipment and installation sold as stand alone components  as well as an evaluation of unrelated third party competitor pricing of similar installation 
revenue on service sales is recognized when repairs are completed at the customer s location or when repairs are completed at our facilities and the products are shipped to customers 
all shipping and handling fees invoiced to customers  such as freight  are recorded as revenue and related costs are included within cost of sales at the time the sale is recognized 
with respect to certain service contracts in our endoscope reprocessing and water purification and filtration operating segments  service revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the contractual term of the arrangement 
none of our sales contain right of return provisions except certain sales of a small portion of our endoscope reprocessing equipment which contain a day right of return trial period 
such sales are not recognized as revenue until the day trial period has elapsed 
customer claims for credit or return due to damage  defect  shortage or other reason must be pre approved by us before credit is issued or such product is accepted for return 
no cash discounts for early payment are offered except with respect to a portion of our sales of dialysis and healthcare disposable products and certain prepaid packaging products 
we do not offer price protection  although advance pricing contracts or required notice periods prior to implementation of price increases exist for certain customers with respect to many of our products 
with respect to certain of our dialysis and dental customers  volume rebates are provided  such volume rebates are provided for as a reduction of sales at the time of revenue recognition and amounted to   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
included in volume rebates for fiscal and are approximately  and  as a result of the addition of healthcare disposable products  offset by cancellation or non renewal of certain volume rebate programs as a result of consolidation in the dialysis industry 
such allowances are determined based on estimated projections of sales volume for the entire rebate agreement periods 
if it becomes known that sales volume to customers will deviate from original projections  the volume rebate provisions originally established would be adjusted accordingly 
the majority of our dialysis products are sold to end users  the majority of therapeutic filtration products and healthcare disposable products are sold to third party distributors  water purification and filtration products and services are sold directly and through third party distributors to hospitals  dialysis clinics  pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and other end users  and specialty packaging products are sold to third party distributors  medical research companies  laboratories  pharmaceutical companies  hospitals  government agencies and other end users 
sales to all of these customers follow our revenue recognition policies 
due to the direct distribution of our endoscope reprocessing products in the united states which commenced on august   a significant portion of our endoscope reprocessing products and services are sold directly to hospitals and other end users 
previously  the majority of our endoscope reprocessing products and services were sold to third party distributors 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable consist of amounts due to us from normal business activities 
allowances for doubtful accounts are reserves for the estimated loss from the inability of customers to make required payments 
we use historical experience as well as current market information in determining the estimate 
while actual losses have historically been within management s expectations and provisions established  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
alternatively  if certain customers paid their delinquent receivables  reductions in allowances may be required 
inventories inventories consist of products which are sold in the ordinary course of our business and are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
in assessing the value of inventories  we must make estimates and judgments regarding reserves required for product obsolescence  aging of inventories and other issues potentially affecting the saleable condition of products 
in performing such evaluations  we use historical experience as well as current market information 
with few exceptions  the saleable value of our inventories has historically been within management s expectation and provisions established  however  rapid changes in the market due to competition  technology and various other factors could have an adverse effect on the saleable value of our inventories  resulting in the need for additional reserves 
goodwill and intangible assets certain of our identifiable intangible assets  including customer relationships  technology  brand names  non compete agreements and patents  are amortized on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives which range from to years 
additionally  we have recorded goodwill and trademarks and trade names  all of which have indefinite useful lives and are therefore not amortized 
all of our intangible assets and goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  and goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment at least annually 
our management is primarily responsible for determining if impairment exists and considers a number of factors  including third party valuations  when making these determinations 
in performing a review for goodwill impairment  management uses a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the related operating segments 
the first step is a review for potential impairment  and the second step measures the amount of impairment  if any 
in performing our annual review for indefinite lived intangibles  management compares the current fair value of such assets to their carrying values 
with respect to amortizable intangible assets when impairment indicators are present  management would determine whether non discounted cash flows would be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets  if not  the carrying value of the assets would be adjusted to their fair value 
on july   management concluded that none of our intangible assets or goodwill was impaired 
while the results of these annual reviews have historically not indicated impairment  impairment reviews are highly dependent on management s projections of our future operating results which management believes to be reasonable 
long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets including property  equipment and other assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
an assessment is made to determine if the sum of the expected future non discounted cash flows from the use of the assets and eventual disposition is less than the carrying value 
if the sum of the expected non discounted cash flows is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized based on fair value 
with few exceptions  our historical assessments of our long lived assets have not differed significantly from the actual amounts realized 
however  the determination of fair value requires us to make certain assumptions and estimates and is highly subjective  and accordingly  actual amounts realized may differ significantly from our estimates 
warranties we provide for estimated costs that may be incurred to remedy deficiencies of quality or performance of our products at the time of revenue recognition 
most of our products have a one year warranty  although a majority of our endoscope reprocessing equipment in the united states carry a warranty period of up to fifteen months 
we record provisions for product warranties as a component of cost of sales based upon an estimate of the amounts necessary to settle existing and future claims on products sold 
the historical relationship of warranty costs to products sold is the primary basis for the estimate 
a significant increase in third party service repair rates  the cost and availability of parts or the frequency of claims could have a material adverse impact on our results for the period or periods in which such claims or additional costs materialize 
management reviews its warranty exposure periodically and believes that the warranty reserves are adequate  however  actual claims incurred could differ from original estimates  requiring adjustments to the reserves 
stock based compensation on august   we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method for the transition 
under the modified prospective method  stock compensation expense will be recognized for any option grant or stock award granted on or after august   as well as the unvested portion of stock options granted prior to august   based upon the award s fair value 
for fiscal and earlier periods  we accounted for stock options using the intrinsic value method under which stock compensation expense is not recognized because we granted stock options with exercise prices equal to the market value of the shares at the date of grant 
most of our stock option and nonvested stock awards are subject to graded vesting in which portions of the award vest at different times during the vesting period  as opposed to awards that vest at the end of the vesting period 
we recognize compensation expense for awards subject to graded vesting using the straight line basis  reduced by estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience 
the stock based compensation expense recorded in our consolidated financial statements may not be representative of the effect of stock based compensation expense in future periods due to the level of awards issued in past years which level may not be similar in the future  assumptions used in determining fair value  and estimated forfeitures 
we determine the fair value of each unvested stock award using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
we estimate the fair value of each option grant on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
the determination of fair value using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the expected option life which is determined by using the historical closing prices of our common stock  the expected dividend yield which is expected to be  and the expected option life which is based on historical exercise behavior 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  the compensation expense that we would record under sfas r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
with respect to stock options granted during fiscal  we reassessed both the expected option life and stock price volatility assumptions by evaluating more recent historical exercise behavior and stock price activity  such reevaluation resulted in reductions in both the expected option lives and volatility 
legal proceedings in the normal course of business  we are subject to pending and threatened legal actions 
we record legal fees and other expenses related to litigation as incurred 
additionally  we assess  in consultation with our counsel  the need to record a liability for litigation and contingencies on a case by case basis 
amounts are accrued when we  in consultation with counsel  determine that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount of anticipated exposure can be reasonably estimated 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities also include items recorded in conjunction with the purchase accounting for business acquisitions 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance  if necessary  based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets  as adjusted for valuation allowances  will be realized 
additionally  deferred tax liabilities are regularly reviewed to confirm that such amounts are appropriately stated 
such a review considers known future changes in various effective tax rates  principally in the united states 
if the effective tax rate were to change in the future  particularly in the united states  our items of deferred tax could be materially affected 
all of such evaluations require significant management judgments 
it is our policy to establish reserves for exposures as a result of an examination by tax authorities 
we establish the reserves based primarily upon management s assessment of exposure associated with acquired companies and permanent tax differences 
the tax reserves are analyzed periodically at least annually and adjustments are made  as events occur to warrant adjustment to the reserves 
the majority of our income tax reserves originated from acquisitions 
business combinations acquisitions require significant estimates and judgments related to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
certain liabilities and reserves are subjective in nature 
we reflect such liabilities and reserves based upon the most recent information available 
in conjunction with our acquisitions  such subjective liabilities and reserves principally include certain income tax and sales and use tax exposures  including tax liabilities related to our foreign subsidiaries  as well as reserves for accounts receivable  inventories and warranties 
the ultimate settlement of such liabilities may be for amounts which are different from the amounts recorded 
costs associated with exit or disposal activities we recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities  such as costs to terminate a contract  the exit or disposal of a business  or the early termination of a leased property  by recognizing the liability at fair value when incurred  except for certain one time termination benefits  such as severance costs  for which the period of recognition begins when a severance plan is communicated to employees 
inherent in the calculation of liabilities relating to exit and disposal activities are significant management judgments and estimates  including estimates of termination costs  employee attrition  and the interest rate used to discount certain expected net cash payments 
such judgments and estimates are reviewed by us on a regular basis 
the cumulative effect of a change to a liability resulting from a revision to either timing or the amount of estimated cash flows is recognized by us as an adjustment to the liability in the period of the change 
although we have historically recorded minimal charges associated with exit or disposal activities  we recorded approximately  of severance costs in income from discontinued operations in fiscal related to the sale of substantially all of carsen s assets 
other matters we do not have any off balance sheet financial arrangements  other than future commitments under operating leases and employment and license agreements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency and market risk a portion of our products are imported from the far east and western europe 
all of our operating segments sell a portion of their products outside of the united states and our netherlands subsidiary sells a portion of its products outside of the european union 
consequently  our business could be materially affected by the imposition of trade barriers  fluctuations in the rates of exchange of various currencies  tariff increases and import and export restrictions  affecting the united states  canada and the netherlands 
a portion of our canadian subsidiaries inventories and operating costs which are reported in the water purification and filtration and specialty packaging segments are purchased in the united states and a significant amount of their sales are to customers in the united states 
the businesses of our canadian subsidiaries could be materially and adversely affected by the imposition of trade barriers  fluctuations in the rate of currency exchange  tariff increases and import and export restrictions between the united states and canada 
additionally  the financial statements of our canadian subsidiaries are translated using the accounting policies described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange between the united states and canada had an overall adverse impact in fiscal  compared with fiscal  upon our continuing results of operations and a positive impact on stockholders equity  as described in our md a 
changes in the value of the euro against the united states dollar affect our results of operations because a portion of the net assets of our netherlands subsidiary which are reported in our dialysis  endoscope reprocessing and water purification and filtration segments are denominated and ultimately settled in united states dollars but must be converted into its functional euro currency 
additionally  financial statements of the netherlands subsidiary are translated using the accounting policies described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange between the euro and the united states dollar had an overall adverse impact in fiscal  compared with fiscal  upon our continuing results of operations and had a positive impact upon stockholders equity  as described in our md a 
in order to hedge against the impact of fluctuations in the value of the euro relative to the united states dollar on the conversion of such dollar denominated net assets into functional currency  we enter into short term contracts to purchase euros forward  which contracts are generally one month in duration 
these short term contracts are designated as fair value hedges 
there was one foreign currency forward contract amounting to  at july  which covered certain assets and liabilities of minntech s netherlands subsidiary which are denominated in united states dollars 
such contract expired on august  under our credit facilities  such contracts to purchase euros may not exceed  in an aggregate notional amount at any time 
during fiscal  such forward contracts were effective in offsetting the impact on operations of the strengthening of the euro 
the functional currency of minntech s japan subsidiary is the japanese yen 
changes in the value of the japanese yen relative to the united states dollar during fiscal and did not have a significant impact upon either our results of operations or the translation of the balance sheet  primarily due to the fact that our japanese subsidiary accounts for a relatively small portion of consolidated net sales  net income and net assets 
interest rate market risk we have a united states credit facility for which the interest rate on outstanding borrowings is variable 
therefore  interest expense is affected by the general level of interest rates in the united states 
market risk sensitive transactions we are exposed to market risks arising principally from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency 
with respect to interest rate risk  our outstanding debt is under our united states credit facilities  described elsewhere in liquidity and capital resources 
such credit facilities consist of outstanding debt with fixed repayment amounts at prevailing market rates of interest  principally under libor contracts ranging from one to twelve months 
therefore  our market risk with respect to such debt is the increase in interest expense which would result from higher interest rates associated with libor 
such outstanding debt under our united states credit facilities was  and  at july  and  respectively  and the average outstanding balance during fiscal and was approximately  and  respectively 
a basis point increase in average libor interest rates would have resulted in incremental interest expense of approximately  and  during fiscal and  respectively 
presently  we do not utilize any interest rate derivatives 
our other long term liabilities would not be materially affected by an increase in interest rates 
we also maintained a cash balance of  at july  which is invested in low risk cash equivalents at prevailing market rates of interest principally in the united states and canada 
an increase in interest rates would generate additional interest income for us which would partially offset the adverse impact of the additional interest expense 
with respect to foreign currency exchange rates  we are principally impacted by changes in the canadian dollar and the euro as these currencies relate to the united states dollar 
we use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency transactions 
market risk is defined here as the potential change in fair value resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates 
our canadian subsidiaries and netherlands subsidiary have net assets in currencies principally united states dollars other than their functional canadian and euro currency which must be converted into its functional currency  thereby giving rise to realized foreign exchange gains and losses 
therefore  our canadian subsidiaries and netherlands subsidiary are exposed to risk if the value of the canadian dollar or euro appreciates relative to the united states dollar 
a increase in both the canadian dollar and euro relative to the united states dollar subsequent to july  could result in aggregate realized losses of approximately  after tax 
however  since our netherlands subsidiary uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against the impact of fluctuations of the euro relative to the united states dollar on certain united states denominated assets and liabilities  the realized losses relating to the fluctuation of the euro would be partially offset by gains on the foreign currency forward contracts 
in addition to the above  adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the translation of our financial statements 
for fiscal and  a uniform adverse movement in foreign currency rates would have resulted in realized losses after tax of approximately  and  respectively  due to the translation of the results of operations of foreign subsidiaries adverse changes would be caused by appreciation of either the canadian dollar or the euro relative to the united states dollar 
however  such a change in foreign currency rates would have resulted in an unrealized gain on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries of  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
such an unrealized gain would be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in our stockholders equity 
conversely  if the canadian dollar or the euro depreciated by relative to the dollar  we would have recognized realized gains after tax of approximately  and  in fiscal and  respectively  and unrealized losses of  and  in fiscal and  respectively  on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries 
however  since we view these investments as long term  we would not expect such unrealized losses to be realized in the near term
