critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventories  sales 
table of contents returns  income taxes  accounts receivable allowances  share based compensation  impairment testing and warranty 
we base our estimates on historical experience  performance metrics and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results will differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we apply the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition revenues are recognized when the risk of ownership and title passes to our customers 
generally  we extend credit to our customers and do not require collateral 
our payment terms generally range from net to net  depending on the country or whether we sell directly to retailers in the country or to a distributor 
generally  our sales agreements with any of our customers do not provide for any rights of return 
however  we do approve returns on a case by case basis in our sole discretion to protect our brand and our image 
we provide allowances for estimated returns when revenues are recorded  and related losses have historically been within our expectations 
if returns are higher than our estimates  our earnings would be adversely affected 
accounts receivable  reserve for refunds and returns and allowance for doubtful accounts throughout the year  we perform credit evaluations of our customers  and we adjust credit limits based on payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness 
we continuously monitor our collections and maintain a reserve for estimated credit 
we reserve for estimated future refunds and returns at the time of shipment based upon historical data 
we adjust reserves as we consider necessary 
we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for anticipated bad debts and refunds 
provisions are made based upon a review of all significant outstanding invoices and overall quality and age of those invoices not specifically reviewed 
in determining the provision for invoices not specifically reviewed  we analyze collection experience  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends 
if the data used to calculate these allowances does not reflect our future ability to collect outstanding receivables  an adjustment in the reserve for refunds may be required 
historically  our losses have been consistent with our estimates  but there can be no assurance that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have experienced in the past 
unforeseen  material financial difficulties experienced by our customers could have an adverse impact on our profits 
share based compensation expense adoption of sfas no 
r on january   we adopted sfas no 
r share based payments sfas no 
r  which requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service 
the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments is estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments 
sfas no 
r eliminates the use of accounting principles board apb opinion and the option for pro forma disclosure in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 

we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method and therefore prior periods are not restated 
the adoption of sfas no 
r did not have a material impact on our cash flows during the year ended december  
table of contents determining fair value under sfas no 
r valuation and amortization method 
consistent with the valuation method used for the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
 we are using the black scholes option pricing valuation model single option approach to calculate the fair value of stock option grants 
for options with graded vesting  the option grant is treated as a single award and compensation cost is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the entire award 
expected term 
the expected term of options granted represents the period of time that the option is expected to be outstanding 
we estimate the expected term of the option grants based on historical exercise patterns that we believe to be representative of future behavior as well as other various factors 
expected volatility 
we estimate our volatility using our historical share price performance over the expected life of the options  which management believes is materially indicative of expectations about expected future volatility 
risk free interest rate 
we use risk free interest rates in the black scholes option valuation model that are based on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options 
dividend rate 
we have not paid dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
therefore  we use an expected dividend yield of zero 
forfeitures 
sfas no 
r requires companies to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent reporting periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
for purposes of calculating pro forma information under sfas no 
for periods prior to the date of adoption of sfas no 
r  we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
r related to forfeitures was not material to our financial statements 
restricted cash as of december   we had  of restricted cash held in an escrow account in accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement  pursuant to which we purchased lem 
the escrow account relates to the earn out provision of the purchase agreement 
the escrow account must be maintained at a minimum level of  euro through june  as of december   we also had million on deposit with comerica bank to be used as collateral to secure the line of credit facility 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
inventories inventories consist primarily of raw materials and finished products  including sunglasses  goggles  apparel and accessories  product components such as replacement lenses  purchasing and quality control costs  and packaging and shipping materials 
inventory items are carried on the books at the lower of cost or market using the weighted average cost method for lem and first in first out method for our distribution business 
periodic physical counts of inventory items are conducted to help verify the balance of inventory 
a reserve is maintained for obsolete or slow moving inventory 
goodwill goodwill is not amortized but instead is measured for impairment at least annually  or when events indicate that a likely impairment exists 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at least annually based on a two step impairment test 
the first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount  
table of contents including goodwill 
if the carrying amount exceeds fair value  then the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
the fair value of each reporting unit was determined using a combination of the income approach and the market approach 
under the income approach  the fair value of a reporting unit is calculated based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
the present value of estimated future cash flows uses our estimates of revenue for the reporting units  driven by assumed market growth rates and assumed market segment share  and estimated costs as well as appropriate discount rates 
these estimates are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage the underlying business 
under the market approach  fair value is estimated based on market multiples of earnings for comparable companies and similar transactions 
we performed our annual test of goodwill on october   which did not indicate any impairment and thus the second step was not performed 
in performing the goodwill test for the lem reporting unit  we assumed an income tax rate of  a discount rate of and a long term sales growth rate of 
for the orange inc reporting unit  we assumed an income tax rate of  a discount rate of and a long term sales growth rate of 
determining fair value under the first step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the extent of such charge 
research and development we expense research and development costs as incurred 
we capitalize product molds and tooling and depreciate these costs over the useful life of the asset 
income taxes we account for income taxes pursuant to the asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed at each balance sheet date for temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to affect taxable income 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing  prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the value of our deferred tax assets 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized  we will reduce the value of these assets to their expected realizable value  thereby decreasing net income 
evaluating the value of these assets is necessarily based on our management s judgment 
if we subsequently determined that the deferred tax assets  which had been written down  would be realized in the future  the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased  thereby increasing net income in the period when that determination was made 
foreign currency and derivative instruments the functional currency of each of our wholly owned subsidiaries  spy optic  srl  lem and our canadian division is the respective local currency 
accordingly  we are exposed to transaction gains and losses that could result from changes in foreign currency 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange on the balance sheet date 
revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rate for the period 
gains and losses from translation of foreign subsidiary financial statements are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
we designate our derivatives based upon the criteria established by sfas accounting for derivative instruments and hedges  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
sfas  as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of sfas  sfas and 
table of contents statement of financial accounting standards no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the accounting for the changes in the fair value of the derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
for a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the derivative s fair value gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
any realized gain or loss on such derivative is reported in cost of goods sold in the accounting period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
the fair value gain or loss from the ineffective portion of the derivative is reported in other income expense immediately 
for a derivative that does not qualify as a cash flow hedge  the change in fair value is recognized at the end of each accounting period in other income expense 
commitments and contingencies we have entered into operating leases  primarily for facilities  and have commitments under endorsement contracts with selected athletes and others who endorse our products 
we also have an agreement with our primary product designer 
matters affecting comparability acquisitions

the sales mix on a dollar basis for was for sunglasses  for goggles and for apparel and accessories 
the decrease is partially offset by our net international sales in us dollars which are affected by the foreign currency exchange rate  primarily the euro  which was stronger during compared to in we experienced delays in manufacturing and shipping our sunglass and goggle products 
these delays have materially affected our results of operations 
these delays have been a result of poor logistical operations  lack of manufacturing equipment and weak management infrastructure in our newly acquired italian subsidiary  lem 
we anticipate that we will continue to experience manufacturing and shipping delays during  and that these delays may have a material impact on our results of operations 
cost of sales and gross profit our consolidated gross profit decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to from 
the decrease in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of sales is primarily due to increases in inventory reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventory that is no longer being marketed for resale of approximately million and due to lower gross margins on sales to lem s third party customers 
sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  lem accounted for million of the increase

the increase in interest expense is due primarily to our acquisition of lem and the need to finance their operations with an italian credit facility of million euros

the remaining million net loss was incurred by our distribution operations compared to a million loss in the increase in the net loss was attributable to a decrease in sales caused by manufacturing and product delays  distributor transitions primarily in australia and asia  and higher selling and marketing and general administrative expenses

table of contents sales volume 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit was for the year ended december   as compared to during the year ended december  as a percentage of net sales  the decrease in gross profit was due primarily to the unfavorable impact on gross margins caused by product purchases made in euro  lower margin sales  an increase in inventory reserves for slower moving and obsolete inventory  and a slight increase in purchasing and quality control expenses

we also had increases in wages and related payroll taxes  insurance costs  franchise fees related to our incorporation in delaware for our public offering  board of director fees  rent expense and investor relations costs 
these increases were primarily attributable to the increased costs of being a public company and were partly offset by a reduction in bad debt reserves 
shipping and warehousing expense shipping and warehousing expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to increased temporary labor of million primarily related to our foreign subsidiary and an increase in third party warehousing expenses of million due to additional leased warehouse space and the transfer of our fulfillment requirements for our international business to an outside agency

our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and lines of credit 
cash flow activities cash provided by or used in operating activities consists primarily of net income loss adjusted primarily for certain non cash items  including depreciation  amortization  deferred income taxes  provision for bad debts  stock compensation expense and the effect of changes in working capital and other activities 
cash provided for by operating activities for the year ended december  was million which consisted of a net loss of million  adjustments for non cash items of approximately million  and million provided for by working capital and other activities 
working capital and other activities consisted primarily of a million decrease in inventory due to an increase in sales and inventory reserves due to slow and obsolete inventory which we no longer market for resale  a million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to timing of payments of vendor invoices and an offsetting million increase in accounts receivable due to timing of customer receipts

credit facilities at december   we had financing arrangements with comerica bank consisting of a line of credit facility with a million limit  a foreign exchange facility and letter of credit accommodations 
these arrangements were secured by all of our assets  excluding our intellectual property  and a million collateral cash deposit with comerica  and were subject to certain covenants 
the million available line of credit was reduced by the amount of outstanding letters of credit sub limit of million and of outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts million sub limit 
borrowings were limited to cover any outstanding letters of credit issued to san paolo imi on behalf of lem million euros or million at december  
our foreign exchange facility allowed us to purchase currency contracts which we used primarily to hedge our foreign currency exposure 
the amount of allowable purchases of such contracts was million 
at december   net foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding amounted to million  which reduced the amount available to us under the line of credit by  as a result  at december   we had an unused line of credit of approximately million with comerica bank 
at december   we were not in compliance with two financial covenants under the financing arrangements with comerica related to maintaining a minimum tangible net worth and not incurring net losses in two consecutive quarters 
on february   we amended our financing arrangements with comerica  which decreased our letter of credit sub limit to million  decreased our foreign exchange facility limit from million to million and extended the expiration date to may  we replaced this line of credit with a line of credit from bfi business finance on february   as described below 
at december   we also have a million euro line of credit in italy with san paolo imi through lem  which expires on september  borrowing availability is based on eligible accounts receivable and export orders received at lem 
at december   there was approximately million euro in availability under this line of credit 
in february  the line of credit was extended to august  on february   spy optic  inc entered into a loan and security agreement loan agreement with bfi business finance bfi with a maximum borrowing capacity of  actual borrowing availability under the loan agreement is based on eligible trade receivable and inventory levels of spy optic  inc and is guaranteed by orange inc 
loans extended pursuant to the agreement will bear interest at a rate per annum of above the higher of i the prime rate as reported in the western edition of the wall street journal from time to time or ii with a minimum monthly interest charge of  we granted bfi a security interest in all of spy optic  inc s assets as security for its obligations under the agreement  except for its copyrights  patents  trademarks  servicemarks and related applications 
the loan agreement imposes certain covenants on spy optic  inc  including  but not limited to  covenants requiring it to provide certain periodic reports to bfi  inform bfi of certain changes in the business  refrain from incurring additional debt in excess of  and refrain from paying dividends 
spy optic  inc also established a bank account in bfi s name into which collections on accounts receivable and 
table of contents other collateral are deposited the collateral account 
pursuant to the deposit control account agreement between spy optic  inc and bfi with respect to the collateral account  bfi is entitled to sweep all amounts deposited into the collateral account and apply the funds to outstanding obligations under the loan agreement  provided that bfi is required to distribute to spy optic  inc any amounts remaining after payment of all amounts due under the loan agreement 
to secure its obligations under the guaranty  orange inc granted bfi a blanket security interest in all of its assets  except for its stock in spy optic  inc  which it has covenanted not to pledge to any other person or entity 
we received a loan in the amount of  upon the execution of the loan agreement 
these proceeds were used to fully collateralize comerica bank for the letter of credit issued by comerica on behalf of orange inc and lem to san paolo imi in the amount of million euros 
we believe that our cash on hand and available loan facilities will be sufficient to enable us to meet our financing and operating requirements for at least the next months 
changes in operating plans  lower than anticipated net sales  increased expenses or other events  including those described in item a  risk factors  may make it difficult for us to seek additional debt or equity financing in the future 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of net sales growth  financing requirements related to our recent acquisition of lem  the expansion of our sales and marketing activities and the continuing market acceptance of our product designs 
although currently we are not a party to any agreement or letter of intent with respect to potential investments in  or acquisitions of  complementary businesses  products or technologies  we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future  which could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
the sale of additional equity securities or convertible debt securities would result in additional dilution of our stockholders 
additional debt would result in increased interest expense and could result in covenants that would restrict our operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not enter into any off balance sheet arrangements during or  nor did we have any off balance sheet arrangements outstanding at december  or long term financial obligations and other commercial commitments the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effect those obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods

income taxes in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based on the level of historical operating results and projections for the taxable income for the future  management has determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets  net of the valuation allowance  will be realized 
accordingly  the company has recorded no valuation allowance for our us operations at december  and we have recorded a  and  valuation allowance for our wholly owned subsidiary  spy optic  srl at december  and  respectively

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk market risk represents the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and foreign exchange rates 
at december   we had no debt outstanding under our loan facilities with comerica and we had unused lines of credit with comerica of million 
however  in february  we replaced this facility with our new facility with bfi  as described above 
the amounts outstanding under these loan facilities at any time may fluctuate and we may from time to time be subject to refinancing risk 
we do not believe that a change of basis points in interest rate would have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
foreign currency risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk that could impact our financial position and results of operations 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments  anticipated sales  anticipated purchases  assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
our risk management strategy with respect to this market risk includes the use of derivative financial instruments 
we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes 
our risks  risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects of changes in fair values for these exposures are outlined below 
we operate our business and derive a substantial portion of our net sales outside of the united states 
we also purchase a majority of our products in transactions denominated in euros 
as a result  we are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates between the local currencies of the foreign markets in which we operate and the us dollar 
our foreign currency exposure is generally related to europe 
a strengthening of the euro relative to the us dollar or to other currencies in which we receive revenues could impact negatively the demand for our products  could increase our manufacturing costs and could reduce our results of operations 
in 
table of contents addition  we manufacture a substantial amount of our sunglass and goggle products in italy 
because these purchases are paid in euros  we face currency risk 
a strengthening euro could negatively affect the cost of our products and reduce our gross profit margins 
we use forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted purchase of products at prices denominated in euros 
we also use other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no 
consisting of forward contracts to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures 
we recognize the gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments in the same period as the remeasurement losses and gains of the related foreign currency denominated exposures 
as of december   we had a total of million in euro foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges at an average euro rate of euro to us dollar and million in euro foreign currency contracts at an average euro rate of not designated as hedging instruments 
the exchange rate for the euro to the us dollar ranged from to in fiscal as part of our risk management procedure  a sensitivity analysis model is used to measure the potential loss in future earnings of market sensitive instruments resulting from a change in foreign currency values 
the sensitivity analysis model quantifies the estimated potential effect of unfavorable movements of in foreign currencies to which we were exposed at december  through its derivative financial instruments 
the estimated one day loss from our foreign currency derivative financial instruments  calculated using the sensitivity model described above  is approximately  at december  we believe that such a hypothetical loss from derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged 
the sensitivity analysis model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in earnings that we may incur  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates 
it also does not represent the maximum possible loss that may occur 
actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates  hedging instruments and hedge percentages  timing and other factors 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued financial interpretation number fin accounting for uncertainty in income taxes which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
additionally  fin provides guidance on the derecognition  classification  accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions 
the accounting provisions of fin will be effective for us beginning january  we are in the process of determining the effect that the adoption of fin will have on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
 which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
does not require any new fair value measurements  but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information 
this statement is effective for us beginning january  we are currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our financial statements 
in september  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying current year misstatements 
sab no 
requires analysis of misstatements using both an income statement rollover approach and a balance sheet iron curtain approach in assessing materiality and provides for a one time cumulative effect transition adjustment 
sab no 
is effective for our fiscal year annual financial statements 
the adoption of sab no 
did not have a material impact on our financial statements
