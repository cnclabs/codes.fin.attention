voluntary withdrawal of vioxx on september   merck announced a voluntary worldwide withdrawal of vioxx  its arthritis and acute pain medication 
the company s decision  which was effective immediately  was based on new three year data from a prospective  randomized  placebo controlled clinical trial  approve adenomatous polyp prevention on vioxx 
the trial  which was stopped  was designed to evaluate the efficacy of vioxx mg in preventing the recurrence of colorectal polyps in patients with a history of colorectal adenomas and  in combination with two other trials  to further assess the cardiovascular safety of vioxx 
in this study  there was an increased relative risk for confirmed cardiovascular events  such as heart attack and stroke  which became apparent beginning after about months of treatment in the patients taking vioxx compared to those taking placebo 
for approximately the first months of the approve study the vioxx and placebo curves appeared to be similar and  in this respect  the approve results were similar to the results of two placebo controlled studies described in the us labeling for vioxx as of the time of withdrawal 
the company estimates that there were million us prescriptions written for vioxx from may through august based on this estimate  the company estimates that the number of patients who have taken vioxx in the united states since its launch is approximately million 
the number of patients outside the united states who have taken vioxx is undetermined at this time 
in october  the company received a letter from senator charles grassley  chairman of the senate committee on finance  requesting certain documents and information related to vioxx 
the company also received requests for information from other congressional committees 
the company has cooperated with these inquiries and has continued to describe the reasons for the company s voluntary withdrawal of vioxx and to answer any questions related to the company s development and extensive testing of the medicine and its disclosures of the results of its studies 
on february   the fda held a joint meeting of the arthritis advisory committee and the drug safety and risk management advisory committee 
the committees discussed the overall benefit to risk considerations including cardiovascular and gastrointestinal safety concerns for cox selective nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs and related agents 
on february   the members of the committees were asked to vote on whether the overall risk versus benefit profile for vioxx supports marketing in the united states 
the members of the committees voted to in support of the marketing of vioxx in the united states 
the company looks forward to further discussions with the fda and other regulatory authorities about vioxx 
as previously announced  the board of directors of the company appointed a special committee to review the company s actions prior to its voluntary withdrawal of vioxx  to act for the board in responding to shareholder litigation matters related to the withdrawal of vioxx and to advise the board with respect to any action that should be taken as a result of the review 
in december  the special committee retained the honorable john s 
martin  jr

in  the company and astra formed an equally owned joint venture that developed and marketed most of astra s new prescription medicines in the united states including prilosec  the first in a class of medications known as proton pump inhibitors  which slows the production of acid from the cells of the stomach lining 
in  the company and astra restructured the joint venture whereby the company acquired astra s interest in the joint venture  renamed kbi inc kbi  and contributed kbi s operating assets to a new us limited partnership named astra pharmaceuticals  us the partnership  in which the company maintains a limited partner interest 
the partnership  renamed astrazeneca lp  became the exclusive distributor of the products for which kbi retained rights 
the company earns certain partnership returns as well as ongoing revenue based on sales of current and future kbi products 
the partnership returns include a priority return provided for in the partnership agreement  variable returns based  in part  upon sales of certain former astra usa  inc products  and a preferential return representing the company s share of undistributed partnership gaap earnings 
in conjunction with the restructuring  for a payment of million  astra purchased an option to buy the company s interest in the kbi products  excluding the company s interest in the gastrointestinal medicines nexium and prilosec 
the company also granted astra an option the shares option to buy the company s common stock interest in kbi  at an exercise price based on the present value of estimated future net sales of nexium and prilosec 
in april  astra merged with zeneca group plc  forming astrazeneca ab astrazeneca 
as a result of the merger  in exchange for the company s relinquishment of rights to future astra products with no existing or pending us patents at the time of the merger  astra paid million  which is subject to a true up calculation in that may require repayment of all or a portion of this amount 
the merger also triggers a partial redemption of the company s limited partner interest in furthermore  as a result of the merger  astrazeneca s option to buy the company s interest in the kbi products is exercisable in and the company has the right to require astrazeneca to purchase such interest in in addition  the shares option is exercisable two years after astra s purchase of the company s interest in the kbi products 
the exercise of this option by astra is also provided for in the year or if combined annual sales of the two products fall below a minimum amount provided  in each case  only so long as either the merck option in or astrazeneca s option in has been exercised 
the exercise price is based on the present value of estimated future net sales of nexium and prilosec as determined at the time of exercise

merial provides a comprehensive range of pharmaceuticals and vaccines to enhance the health  well being and performance of a wide range of animal species 
competition the markets in which the company conducts its business are highly competitive and often highly regulated 
global efforts toward health care cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing and access 
such competition involves an intensive search for technological innovations and the ability to market these innovations effectively 
with its long standing emphasis on research and development  the company is well prepared to compete in the search for technological innovations 
additional resources to meet competition include quality control  flexibility to meet customer specifications  an efficient distribution system and a strong technical information service 
the company is active in acquiring and marketing products through joint ventures and licenses and has been refining its sales and marketing efforts to further address changing industry conditions 
to enhance its product portfolio  the company continues to pursue external alliances  from early stage to late stage product opportunities  including joint ventures and targeted acquisitions 
however  the introduction of new products and processes by competitors may result in price reductions and product replacements  even for products protected by patents 
for example  the number of compounds available to treat diseases typically increases over time and has resulted in slowing the growth in sales of certain of the company s products 
legislation enacted in all states in the united states  particularly in the area of human pharmaceutical products  allows  encourages or  in a few instances  in the absence of specific instructions from the prescribing physician  mandates the use of generic products those containing the same active chemical as an innovator s product rather than brand name products 
governmental and other pressures toward the dispensing of generic products have significantly reduced the sales of certain of the company s products no longer protected by patents  such as zocor  which lost market exclusivity in the us in and the company experienced a significant decline in zocor sales thereafter 
distribution the company sells its human health pharmaceutical products primarily to drug wholesalers and retailers  hospitals  government agencies and managed health care providers such as health maintenance organizations and other institutions 
human health vaccines are sold primarily to physicians  wholesalers  physician distributors and government entities 
the company s professional representatives communicate the effectiveness  safety and value of the company s pharmaceutical and vaccine products to health care professionals in private practice  group practices and managed care organizations 
in the fourth quarter of  the company implemented a new distribution program for us wholesalers to moderate the fluctuations in sales caused by wholesaler investment buying and improve efficiencies in the distribution of company pharmaceutical products 
the new program lowered previous limits on average monthly purchases of company pharmaceutical products by us customers 
following the implementation of the program  fluctuations in sales caused by wholesaler investment buying significantly moderated 
raw materials raw materials and supplies  which are generally available from multiple sources  are purchased worldwide and are normally available in quantities adequate to meet the needs of the company s pharmaceutical and vaccines segments 
government regulation and investigation the pharmaceutical industry is subject to global regulation by regional  country  state and local agencies 
of particular importance is the fda in the united states  which administers requirements covering the testing  approval  safety  effectiveness  manufacturing  labeling and marketing of prescription pharmaceuticals 
in many cases  the fda requirements have increased the amount of time and money necessary to develop new products and bring them to market in the united states 
in  the food and drug administration modernization act the fda modernization act was passed and was the culmination of a comprehensive legislative reform effort designed to streamline regulatory procedures within the fda and to improve the regulation of drugs  medical devices and food 
the legislation was principally designed to ensure the timely availability of safe and effective drugs and biologics by expediting the premarket review process for new products 
a key provision of the legislation is the re authorization of the prescription drug user fee act of  which permits the continued collection of user fees from prescription drug manufacturers to augment fda resources earmarked for the review of human drug applications 
this helps provide the resources necessary to ensure the prompt approval of safe and effective new drugs 
in the united states  the government expanded health care access by enacting the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of  which was signed into law in december prescription drug coverage began on january  this legislation supports the company s goal of improving access to medicines by expanding insurance coverage  while preserving market based incentives for pharmaceutical innovation 
at the same time  the legislation will ensure that prescription drug costs will be controlled by competitive pressures and by encouraging the appropriate use of medicines 
in addressing cost containment pressure  the company has made a continuing effort to demonstrate that its medicines can help save costs in overall patient health care 
for many years  the pharmaceutical industry has been under federal and state oversight with the approval process for new drugs  drug safety  advertising and promotion  drug purchasing and reimbursement programs and formularies variously under review 
the company believes that it will continue to be able to conduct its operations  including the introduction of new drugs to the market  in this regulatory environment 
one type of federal initiative to contain federal health care spending is the prospective or capitated payment system  first implemented to reduce the rate of growth in medicare reimbursement to hospitals 
such a system establishes in advance a flat rate for reimbursement for health care for those patients for whom the payor is fiscally responsible 
this type of payment system and other cost containment systems are now widely used by public and private payors and have caused hospitals  health maintenance organizations and other customers of the company to be more cost conscious in their treatment decisions  including decisions regarding the medicines to be made available to their patients 
the company continues to work with private and federal employers to slow increases in health care costs 
further  the company s efforts to demonstrate that its medicines can help save costs in other areas have encouraged the use of the company s medicines and have helped offset the effects of increasing cost pressures 
also  federal and state governments have pursued methods to directly reduce the cost of drugs and vaccines for which they pay 
for example  federal laws require the company to pay specified rebates for medicines reimbursed by medicaid  to provide discounts for outpatient medicines purchased by certain public health service entities and disproportionate share hospitals hospitals meeting certain criteria  and to provide minimum discounts of off of a defined non federal average manufacturer price for purchases by certain components of the federal government such as the department of veterans affairs and the department of defense 
initiatives in some states seek rebates beyond the minimum required by medicaid legislation  in some cases for patients beyond those who are eligible for medicaid 
under the federal vaccines for children entitlement program  the cdc funds and purchases recommended pediatric vaccines at a public sector price for the immunization of medicaid eligible  uninsured  native american and certain underinsured children 
the company was awarded a cdc contract in april which is in effect until march for the supply of pediatric vaccines for the vaccines for children program that had an aggregate estimated value of million at signing 
as of january   patients previously eligible for medicaid who are also medicare beneficiaries years and older or disabled left the state administered medicaid system to be covered by the new medicare prescription drug benefit 
outside the united states  the company encounters similar regulatory and legislative issues in most of the countries where it does business 
there  too  the primary thrust of governmental inquiry and action is toward determining drug safety and effectiveness  often with mechanisms for controlling the prices of or reimbursement for prescription drugs and the profits of prescription drug companies 
the eu has adopted directives concerning the classification  labeling  advertising  wholesale distribution and approval for marketing of medicinal products for human use 
the company s policies and procedures are already consistent with the substance of these directives  consequently  it is believed that they will not have any material effect on the company s business 
the company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies and is  therefore  subject to potential administrative actions 
such actions may include seizures of products and other civil and criminal sanctions 
under certain circumstances  the company on its own may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls 
the company believes that it should be able to compete effectively within this environment 
in addition  certain countries within the eu  recognizing the economic importance of the research based pharmaceutical industry and the value of innovative medicines to society  are working with industry representatives and the european commission ec on proposals to complete the single market in pharmaceuticals and improve the competitive climate through a variety of means including market deregulation 
the company is subject to a number of privacy and data protection laws and regulations globally 
the legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve  and there has been an increasing amount of focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect directly the company s business 
patents  trademarks and licenses patent protection is considered  in the aggregate  to be of material importance in the company s marketing of human health products in the united states and in most major foreign markets 
patents may cover products per se  pharmaceutical formulations  processes for or intermediates useful in the manufacture of products or the uses of products 
protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the legal life of patents in the various countries 
the protection afforded  which may also vary from country to country  depends upon the type of patent and its scope of coverage 
patent portfolios developed for products introduced by the company normally provide market exclusivity 
basic patents are in effect for the following major products in the united states cancidas  comvax haemophilus b conjugate and hepatitis b 
recombinant 
vaccine  cosopt  cozaar  crixivan  emend  fosamax  gardasil  hyzaar  invanz ertapenem sodium  maxalt  primaxin  propecia  recombivax hb hepatitis b vaccine 
recombinant  rotateq  singulair  januvia  trusopt  zolinza and zostavax 
basic patents are also in effect in the united states for zetia and vytorin  which were developed by the merck schering plough partnership 
a basic patent is also in effect for sustiva stocrin efavirenz 
bristol myers squibb bms  under an exclusive license from the company  sells sustiva in the united states  canada and certain european countries 
the company markets stocrin in other countries throughout the world 
the basic patent for aggrastat tirofiban hydrochloride in the united states was divested with the product in the company retains basic patents for aggrastat outside the united states 
the fda modernization act includes a pediatric exclusivity provision that may provide an additional six months of market exclusivity in the united states for indications of new or currently marketed drugs if certain agreed upon pediatric studies are completed by the applicant 
these exclusivity provisions were re authorized until october  by the best pharmaceuticals for children act passed in january in  the fda granted an additional six months of market exclusivity in the united states to invanz until august in  the fda granted an additional six months of market exclusivity in the united states to trusopt until october in  the fda granted an additional six months of market exclusivity in the united states to cozaar hyzaar until february in  the fda granted an additional six months of market exclusivity in the united states to singulair until august for further information with respect to the company s patents  see patent litigation on page while the expiration of a product patent normally results in a loss of market exclusivity for the covered pharmaceutical product  commercial benefits may continue to be derived from i later granted patents on processes and intermediates related to the most economical method of manufacture of the active ingredient of such product  ii patents relating to the use of such product  iii patents relating to novel compositions and formulations  and iv in the united states  market exclusivity that may be available under federal law 
the effect of product patent expiration on pharmaceutical products also depends upon many other factors such as the nature of the market and the position of the product in it  the growth of the market  the complexities and economics of the process for manufacture of the active ingredient of the product and the requirements of new drug provisions of the federal food  drug and cosmetic act or similar laws and regulations in other countries 
additions to market exclusivity are sought in the united states and other countries through all relevant laws  including laws increasing patent life 
some of the benefits of increases in patent life have been partially offset by a general increase in the number of  incentives for and use of generic products 
additionally  improvements in intellectual property laws are sought in the united states and other countries through reform of patent and other relevant laws and implementation of international treaties 
in june  zocor lost its market exclusivity in the united states and the company experienced a significant decline in us zocor sales after that time 
in june  the basic patent in the united states covering proscar expired 
as a result  the company experienced a significant decline in us proscar sales after that time 
the basic patent for proscar also covers propecia  however  propecia is protected by additional patents which expire in october in  the fda granted an additional six months of market exclusivity in the united states to fosamax until february  and fosamax once weekly until january however  on january   the us court of appeals for the federal circuit in washington  dc found the company s patent claims for once weekly administration of fosamax to be invalid 
the company exhausted all options to appeal this decision in based on the court of appeals decision  fosamax will lose its market exclusivity in the united states in february fosamax plus d will lose its us market exclusivity in april the company expects significant declines in each product s sales after each product s respective loss of market exclusivity 
worldwide  all of the company s important products are sold under trademarks that are considered in the aggregate to be of material importance 
trademark protection continues in some countries as long as used  in other countries  as long as registered 
registration is for fixed terms and can be renewed indefinitely 
royalties received during on patent and know how licenses and other rights amounted to million 
the company also paid royalties amounting to million in under patent and know how licenses it holds 
research and development the company s business is characterized by the introduction of new products or new uses for existing products through a strong research and development program 
approximately  people are employed in the company s research activities 
expenditures for the company s research and development programs were billion in  billion in and billion in the company maintains its ongoing commitment to research over a broad range of therapeutic areas and clinical development in support of new products 
the company maintains a number of long term exploratory and fundamental research programs in biology and chemistry as well as research programs directed toward product development 
merck s new research and development model is designed to increase productivity and improve the probability of success by prioritizing the company s research and development resources on nine priority disease areas alzheimer s disease  atherosclerosis  cardiovascular disease  diabetes  novel vaccines  obesity  oncology targeted therapies  pain and sleep disorders 
these therapeutic areas were carefully chosen based on a set of criteria including unmet medical needs  scientific opportunity and commercial opportunity 
within these therapeutic areas  merck will commit resources to achieve research breadth and depth and to develop best in class targeted and differentiated products that are valued highly by patients  payers and physicians 
the company will also make focused investments to pursue specific mechanisms in the following selected disease areas antibiotics  antifungals  antivirals hepatitis c virus  human immunodeficiency virus  asthma  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  neurodegeneration  ophthalmology  osteoporosis  schizophrenia and stroke 
in addition  the company will capitalize on selected opportunities outside these areas by continuing to commercialize attractive clinical development candidates in the pipeline and by pursuing appropriate external licensing opportunities 
in the development of human health products  industry practice and government regulations in the united states and most foreign countries provide for the determination of effectiveness and safety of new chemical compounds through preclinical tests and controlled clinical evaluation 
before a new drug may be marketed in the united states  recorded data on preclinical and clinical experience are included in the nda or the biologics license application to the fda for the required approval 
the development of certain other products is also subject to government regulations covering safety and efficacy in the united states and many foreign countries 
once the company s scientists discover a new compound that they believe has promise to treat a medical condition  the company commences preclinical testing with that compound 
preclinical testing includes laboratory testing and animal safety studies to gather data on chemistry  pharmacology and toxicology 
pending acceptable preclinical data  the company will initiate clinical testing in accordance with established regulatory requirements 
the clinical testing begins with phase i studies  which are designed to assess safety  tolerability  pharmacokinetics  and preliminary pharmacodynamic activity of the compound in humans 
if favorable  additional  larger phase ii studies are initiated to determine the efficacy of the compound in the affected population  define appropriate dosing for the compound  as well as identify any adverse effects that could limit the compound s usefulness 
if data from the phase ii trials are satisfactory  the company commences large scale phase iii trials to confirm the compound s efficacy and safety 
upon completion of those trials  if satisfactory  the company submits regulatory filings with the appropriate regulatory agencies around the world to have the product candidate approved for marketing 
there can be no assurance that a compound that is the result of any particular program will obtain the regulatory approvals necessary for it to be marketed 
in the united states  the fda approval process begins once a complete nda is submitted and received by the fda 
pursuant to the prescription drug user fee act  the fda review period targets for ndas or supplemental ndas is either six months  for priority review  or ten months  for a standard review 
within days after receipt of an nda  the fda determines if the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review 
the fda also assesses  at that time  whether the application will be granted a priority review or standard review 
once the review timelines are defined  the fda will act upon the application within those timelines  unless a major amendment has been submitted either at the company s own initiative or the fda s request to the pending application 
if this occurs  the fda may extend the review period to allow for review of the new information  but by no more than days 
extensions to the review period are communicated to the company 
the fda can act on an application by issuing an approval letter  a non approvable letter  or an approvable letter 
based on fda statistics  drug development time from initiation of preclinical testing to nda approval can range from to years with an average of years 
the company has three drug candidates currently under fda review in june  the fda accepted for standard review an nda for mk  the intravenous prodrug of emend  for the treatment of cinv 
the company anticipates a decision on the nda in the second quarter of in july  the fda accepted for standard review the nda for janumet  the company s investigational oral medicine combining januvia with metformin  which is designed to provide an additional treatment for patients needing more than one oral agent to help control blood sugar for treatment of type diabetes 
the company expects fda action on the nda by the end of march the company is also moving forward as planned with regulatory filings in countries outside the united states 
arcoxia  the company s investigational selective cox inhibitor  remains under standard review by the fda in the united states 
in response to the fda s approvable letter  merck included results of the medal multinational etoricoxib and diclofenac arthritis long term program that showed the rate of confirmed thrombotic cardiovascular events was similar between arcoxia and diclofenac  the most widely used nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug in the world 
the company anticipates fda action in april the company expects that an fda advisory committee meeting will be held prior to fda action 
arcoxia is currently available in more than countries in europe  latin america  the asia pacific region and middle east northern africa 
the company anticipates filing three ndas with the fda in the company plans to file an nda for mk with the fda in the second quarter of and has received fast track designation for an indication in treatment experienced patients 
interim week data from the dose ranging phase ii trial of mk  the company s investigational hiv integrase inhibitor  in patients with advanced hiv infection were presented at the th annual conference on retroviruses and opportunistic infections in february the results showed that the oral investigational medication at all three doses studied in combination with optimized background therapy obt had greater antiretroviral activity than obt alone 
study results also showed that mk in combination with obt was generally well tolerated in these patients who were failing antiretroviral therapy art  who were resistant to at least one drug of each of the three available classes of oral arts  and who had limited active arts as options for treatment 
at the american society for microbiology s th annual international conference on antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy in september  the company presented interim week data from this ongoing study in treatment experienced patients  which demonstrated mk maintaining viral load regression 
in august at the th international aids conference  the company presented interim week data from the phase ii dose ranging trial of mk conducted in treatment na ve  hiv infected patients 
the data showed that mk twice daily  when used in combination with tenofovir and lamivudine  achieved a comparable viral load reduction to efavirenz combined with the same agents in previously untreated patients 
in september at the american society for microbiology s th annual international conference on antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy  the company presented additional interim week data from this phase ii dose ranging study in treatment na ve patients that demonstrated no increase in lipid levels in patients taking mk with tenofovir and lamivudine 
the company has entered into phase iii clinical trials with mk a and to support mk b  investigational therapies for lipid management 
mk a represents a novel approach to lowering ldl c  raising hdl c and lowering triglycerides 
mk b combines mk a with the proven benefits of simvastatin to potentially reduce the risk of coronary heart disease beyond what statins provide alone 
the company plans to file mk a with the fda in and to file mk b in in november  the company presented data from a phase ii study at the american heart association s scientific sessions in chicago that showed co administration of mk with er niacin significantly reduced flushing in patients with dyslipidemia compared to those patients who took er niacin alone 
flushing  characterized by redness of the skin with warming or burning on the face and neck caused by the dilation of blood vessels near the skin  is a common niacin induced side effect that can cause discomfort to patients and is a significant factor leading to discontinuation of niacin therapy 
in october  the company and h
