item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere herein 
overview we are a major supplier to the aerospace industry and have two operating segments i triumph aerospace systems group  whose companies design  engineer and manufacture a wide range of proprietary and build to print components  assemblies and systems for the global aerospace oem market  and ii triumph aftermarket services group  whose companies serve aircraft fleets  notably commercial airlines  the us military and cargo carriers  through the maintenance  repair and overhaul of aircraft components and accessories manufactured by third parties 
financial highlights for fiscal include net sales for fiscal increased to million operating income in fiscal increased to million net income for fiscal increased to million backlog increased over prior year to billion for fiscal year  net sales totaled million  a increase from fiscal year net sales of million 
net income for fiscal year increased to million  or per diluted common share  versus million  or per diluted common share  for fiscal year our working capital needs are generally funded through cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit arrangements 
for the fiscal year ended march   we generated approximately million of cash flows from operating activities  used approximately million in investing activities and generated approximately million in financing activities 
we continue to remain focused on growing our core businesses as well as growing through strategic acquisitions 
our organic growth has remained robust through continually adding products and services  expanding our operating capacity and marketing our complete portfolio of capabilities 
our core revenue growth in fiscal as compared to fiscal excluding the impact of acquisitions was 
our company has an aggressive but highly selective acquisition approach that adds capabilities and increases our capacity for strong and consistent internal growth 
during fiscal we acquired four companies  which have significantly enhanced our product and service capabilities  while adding in excess of million in annualized revenue 
during fiscal  we restructured our financing facilities through the issuance of low interest convertible debt and the retirement of higher interest notes 
we have also increased our revolving credit facility 
these transactions will enable us to support internal growth initiatives and the funding of future acquisitions 
in july  our board of directors declared our first quarterly cash dividend 
outlook net sales for fiscal are expected to grow in the range of billion to billion  and earnings per share for fiscal are expected to be between and 
our fiscal outlook is based on the following market assumptions the commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive 
market liberalization in europe and asia has continued to enable low cost airlines to gain market share  and traditional airlines continue to improve their competitive position by lowering their cost structure through merger us airways america west  bankruptcy delta airlines and northwest and restructuring american airlines 
some of the airline restructurings have led to increased outsourcing opportunities  benefiting our aftermarket services segment 
aircraft seat miles  a key indicator of airline health  remains steady at a growth in calendar  positively affecting our business 
the continued growth in air freight also will benefit us and the industry 
finally  recent upward movement in airline ticket prices  which are being sustained  should help stabilize the financial position of the airlines 
air cargo continues to exhibit strong growth and financial stability  a key market segment for triumph given our product penetration with these carriers 
the major trends that shape the current military defense environment include a growing us government defense budget and rapid expansion of information and communication technologies 
the us department of defense dod authorization was approved in the fourth quarter of at a total level of billion for and billion for excluding supplementals 
although under pressure  the dod budget remains strong and focused on transformation 
with this continued pressure on the budget  the dod will continue to focus on affordability strategies emphasizing network centric operations  joint interoperability  long range strike  unmanned air combat and reconnaissance vehicles  precision guided weapons and continued privatization of logistics and support activities as a means to improve overall effectiveness while maintaining control over costs 
deliveries of airbus and boeing large commercial aircraft are expected to be higher in calendar compared to calendar airbus and boeing reported actual deliveries for calendar of aircraft 
their deliveries for calendar are expected to increase by approximately  to about aircraft 
capacity in the global airline system  as measured by available seat miles asms is expected to continue to grow 
we expect global asm growth of about in calendar compared to calendar our sales to airlines for large commercial and regional aircraft aftermarket parts and service are expected to grow with increases in capacity 
total regional and business aircraft production is expected to increase in fiscal compared to fiscal  as deliveries of business jets are expected to significantly increase with a strong domestic economy and the production of various models of very light jets vlj 
in the regional aircraft market we expect to see growth driven by the seat jet and seat turboprop segments  slightly offset by continued weakness in the seat jet products 
military sales oem and aftermarket are expected to increase roughly in line with global military budgets  which are expected to grow in the single digit range for calendar compared to calendar results of operations fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  year ended march  in thousands net sales segment operating income corporate general and administrative expenses total operating income interest expense and other charge for early extinguishment of debt income tax expense net income net sales increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march  the acquisitions of the assets and businesses of excel manufacturing  inc  air excellence international  inc and its affiliates  allied aerospace industries  inc  and grand prairie accessory services  llc  herein referred to as the acquisitions  contributed million of the net sales increase 
excluding the effects of the acquisitions  organic sales growth was million  or 
the aerospace systems segment benefited primarily from increased sales to our oem customers driven by increased aircraft build rates  while the increase in sales for our aftermarket services segment was the result of increased demand for our services as a result of growth in global air traffic 
segment operating income increased by million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  operating income growth was a direct result of margins attained on increased sales volume as described above and the contribution of million from the acquisitions  partially offset by increases in payroll  healthcare  litigation costs and costs associated with the startup of our new thailand maintenance and repair facility 
corporate general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march   primarily due to recognition of stock based compensation  increased bonus accruals and a settlement of a million claim 
interest expense and other increased by million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  this increase was due to higher average borrowings outstanding used to fund the acquisitions and our capital expenditures  partially offset by lower interest on our new convertible notes issued on september  as compared to the class a senior notes and class b senior notes collectively  the senior notes 
during fiscal  we recorded a charge for early extinguishment of debt totaling million related to the prepayment of the senior notes on october   which included a make whole premium of approximately million and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the senior notes of million 
the effective income tax rates of and for the year ended march  and  respectively  vary from the federal statutory tax rate of primarily due to tax benefits realized from export sales and domestic production activities and from the research and development tax credit

segment operating income increased by million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  operating income growth was a direct result of margins attained on increased sales volume as described above 
also adding to the increase was the shutdown of the other segment  partially offset by increases in payroll  healthcare  litigation costs and costs associated with the startup of our new thailand maintenance and repair facility 
corporate general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  primarily due to rent expense and other costs associated with idle facilities  as well as increased staffing  incentive compensation expense and costs associated with acquisitions that we pursued but did not complete  partially offset by decreased regulatory costs 
interest expense and other decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in average borrowings outstanding and less foreign exchange losses  partially offset by increased interest rates on our credit facility and industrial revenue bonds  and higher imputed interest on our liability related to our purchase of the revenue sharing program position on the cfm the effective tax rate was for fiscal and for fiscal the fiscal and effective tax rates vary from the federal statutory tax rate of primarily due to benefits realized from the research and development tax credit and the extraterritorial income exclusion

business segment performance we are a major supplier to the aerospace industry and have two operating segments i triumph aerospace systems group  and ii triumph aftermarket services group 
our aerospace systems segment consists of operating locations  and the aftermarket services segment consists of operating locations at march  the other segment consisted of operating locations prior to the elimination of this segment as of march  due to the shutdown  sale or transfer of assets to our other operating segments 
the aerospace systems segment consists of the company s operations which manufacture products primarily for the aerospace oem market 
the aerospace systems operations design and engineer mechanical and electromechanical controls  such as hydraulic systems and components  main engine gearbox assemblies  accumulators and mechanical control cables 
the aerospace systems revenues are also derived from stretch forming  die forming  milling  bonding  machining  welding and assembly and fabrication of various structural components used in aircraft wings  fuselages and other significant assemblies 
further  the segment s operations also design and manufacture composite assemblies for floor panels  environmental control system ducts and non structural cockpit components 
these products are sold to various aerospace oems on a global basis 
the aftermarket services segment consists of the company s operations that provide maintenance  repair and overhaul services to both commercial and military markets on components and accessories manufactured by third parties 
maintenance  repair and overhaul revenues are derived from services on auxiliary power units  airframe and engine accessories  including constant speed drives  cabin compressors  starters and generators  and pneumatic drive units 
in addition  the aftermarket services operations repair and overhaul thrust reversers  nacelle components and flight control surfaces 
the aftermarket services operations also perform repair and overhaul services  and supply spare parts for various types of cockpit instruments and gauges for a broad range of commercial airlines on a worldwide basis 
the other segment s operations and assets  primarily comprised of the industrial gas turbine igt businesses  manufactured or repaired and overhauled igt components  primarily for oems and power generation equipment operators  and applied high temperature coatings for both internal and external customers 
these operations and assets have been sold  liquidated  or re deployed to the other two remaining segments  and were not a reportable segment after march  business segment performance fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  year ended march  of total sales change in thousands net sales aerospace systems aftermarket services elimination of inter segment sales total net sales year ended march  of segment sales change in thousands segment operating income aerospace systems aftermarket services corporate n a n a total segment operating income prior year segment results have been changed to classify certain revenue and costs from the aftermarket services segment to the aerospace systems segment for the operations of triumph fabrications phoenix and triumph fabrications fort worth as most of their product line has been transitioned to aerospace oem products 
the transitioning of these business units resulted in the shift of approximately million in revenue and million in operating loss for the year ended march   previously reported in the aftermarket services segment  to the aerospace systems segment 
for all years presented  segment results have been adjusted to reflect these changes 
aerospace systems the aerospace systems segment net sales increased by million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  the increase was primarily due to increased sales to our oem customers of million driven by increased aircraft build rates and the net sales contributed from the acquisition of the assets and business of excel manufacturing  inc now triumph structures wichita and allied aerospace industries  inc now triumph aerospace systems newport news of million 
aerospace systems segment operating income increased by million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  operating income increased primarily due to margins attained on increased sales volume of million and the margins contributed from the triumph structures wichita and triumph aerospace systems newport news acquisitions of million  partially offset by increases in payroll  research and development costs  litigation costs and healthcare costs 
aftermarket services the aftermarket services segment net sales increased by million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  this increase was primarily due to organic growth of million which was principally associated with global air traffic growth  resulting in increased demand for our repair and overhaul services and million of net sales contributed from the acquisition of the assets and business of air excellence international  inc and its affiliates now triumph interiors and grand prairie accessory services  llc now triumph accessory services grand prairie 
aftermarket services segment operating income increased by million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  operating income increased primarily due to margins attained on increased sales volume of million and the contribution from the acquisition of triumph interiors and triumph accessory services grand prairie of million partially offset by increases in payroll  costs associated with the startup of our new thailand maintenance and repair facility and a charge related to a change in our method of recognizing revenue for the power by the hour contracts

the transitioning of these business units resulted in the shift of approximately million in revenue and million in operating income for the year ended march   previously reported in the aftermarket services segment  to the aerospace systems segment 
for all years presented  segment results have been adjusted to reflect these changes 
aerospace systems the aerospace systems segment net sales increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase was due to the increased sales of large structural precision components and assemblies for the aerospace and defense markets and cabin windows for the general aviation and corporate jet markets resulting from increased production of both commercial and military aircraft 
aerospace systems segment operating income increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal operating income increased due to higher sales volume as described above and improved sales mix  primarily for structural precision components partially offset by an increase in staffing  depreciation and amortization expenses  incentive compensation expense and increased investments in research and development costs 
aftermarket services the aftermarket services segment net sales increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this increase was primarily due to growth in global commercial air traffic and us military maintenance demand resulting in increased demands for our repair and overhaul services 
aftermarket services segment operating income decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal from income of million for fiscal the sales increases as discussed above have been offset by an increase in staffing  depreciation expense  losses associated with customer bankruptcies  compensation expense  costs incurred in developing products associated with new aerospace programs and costs associated with the construction of our new thailand maintenance and repair facility 
other segment effective march   we no longer have other as a reportable segment 
as of march   the other segment operations had ceased and any residual assets were transferred to other company facilities 
during the year ended march   the other segment had sales primarily related to its igt operations of million 
during the year ended march   the other segment incurred an operating loss of million primarily as a result of falling sales to both oems and power generation equipment operators in the igt market 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital needs are generally funded through cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit arrangements 
during the year ended march   we generated approximately million of cash flows from operating activities  used approximately million in investing activities and generated approximately million in financing activities 
in april  the company acquired the assets and business of excel manufacturing  inc now triumph structures wichita  located in wichita  kansas 
in april  the company also acquired the assets and business of air excellence international  inc and its affiliates now triumph interiors which is headquartered in pittsburgh  pennsylvania  and operates two other strategically located facilities dallas  texas  and shannon  ireland 
in november  the company acquired allied aerospace industries  inc now triumph aerospace systems newport news located in newport news  virginia 
in january  the company acquired grand prairie accessory services  llc now triumph accessory services grand prairie  located in grand prairie  texas 
the total cash paid at closing for these acquisitions of approximately million was funded by borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility 
on september   the company amended its existing amended and restated credit agreement the credit facility with its lenders to permit the issuance of up to million of convertible debt and to revise the definition of consolidated total indebtedness to exclude indebtedness under the senior notes 
on september   the company issued million in convertible senior subordinated notes to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to rule a of the securities act of  as amended the notes 
the notes are direct  unsecured  senior subordinated obligations of the company  and rank i junior in right of payment to all of the company s existing and future senior indebtedness  ii equal in right of payment with any other future senior subordinated indebtedness  and iii senior in right of payment to all subordinated indebtedness 
in connection with the issuance and sale of the notes  the company entered into an indenture the indenture  dated as of september   with the bank of new york trust company  na  as trustee 
the company received net proceeds from the sale of the notes of approximately million after deducting estimated offering expenses of approximately million 
the net proceeds from the sale were used to prepay the company s then outstanding senior notes described below  including a make whole premium  fees and expenses in connection with the prepayment  and to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under the company s credit facility 
approximately million in debt issuance costs have been recorded as other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
debt issuance costs are being amortized over a period of five years 
the notes bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum  payable in cash semi annually in arrears on each april and october beginning april  during the period commencing on october  and ending on  but excluding  april  and each six month period from october to march or from april to september thereafter  the company will pay contingent interest during the applicable interest period if the average trading price as defined in the indenture of a note for the five consecutive trading days ending on the third trading day immediately preceding the first day of the relevant six month period equals or exceeds of the principal amount of the notes 
the contingent interest payable per note in respect of any six month period will equal per annum calculated on the average trading price of a note for the relevant five trading day period 
this contingent interest feature represents an embedded derivative 
since it is in the control of the company to call the notes at any time after october   the value of the embedded derivative was determined to be de minimis 
accordingly  no value has been assigned at issuance or at march  the notes mature on october  unless earlier redeemed  repurchased or converted 
the company may redeem the notes for cash  either in whole or in part  anytime on or after october  at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest and additional amounts  if any  up to but not including the date of redemption 
in addition  holders of the notes will have the right to require the company to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their notes on october   and  at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest and additional amounts  if any  up to  but not including  the date of repurchase 
the notes are convertible into the company s common stock at a rate equal to shares per  principal amount of the notes equal to an initial conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustment as described in the indenture 
upon conversion  the company will deliver to the holder surrendering the notes for conversion  for each  principal amount of notes  an amount consisting of cash equal to the lesser of  and the company s total conversion obligation and  to the extent that the company s total conversion obligation exceeds  at the company s election  cash or shares of the company s common stock in respect of the remainder 
a holder may surrender its notes for conversion during any fiscal quarter if the last reported sale price per share of our common stock for at least trading days during the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the previous fiscal quarter is more than of the applicable conversion price per share of our common stock on such last trading day 
the last reported sale price of our common stock on any date means the closing sales price per share on such date as reported by the new york stock exchange 
if the company undergoes a fundamental change as defined in the indenture  holders of the notes will have the right  subject to certain conditions  to require the company to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their notes at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest and additional amounts  if any 
the carrying amount of the notes approximates fair value 
on december   the company filed a shelf registration statement covering resales of the notes and common stock issuable on conversion under rule under the securities act  which registration statement was automatically effective 
on october   the company prepaid all of its outstanding senior notes and  accordingly  the rights of the holders of the senior notes under the note purchase agreement  dated november   between the company and such holders  as amended  ceased 
immediately prior to prepayment  million aggregate principal amount of class a senior notes  which carried a fixed rate of interest of  were outstanding  and million aggregate amount of class b senior notes  which carried a fixed rate of interest of  were outstanding 
if the company had not prepaid the outstanding senior notes  they would have matured on december   subject to a requirement under the note purchase agreement that the company annually prepay million of the outstanding class b notes starting on december  the senior notes were senior unsecured obligations of the company and ranked junior in right of payment to the rights of the company s secured creditors to the extent of their security in the company s assets  equal in right of payment to the rights of creditors under the company s other existing and future unsecured unsubordinated obligations  senior in right of payment to the rights of creditors under obligations expressly subordinated to the senior notes  and effectively subordinated to secured and unsecured creditors of the company s subsidiaries 
the prepayment was made upon proper notice to the holders of the senior notes at a price equal to of the principal amount of the outstanding senior notes being prepaid  plus accrued and unpaid interest of approximately million  plus a make whole premium of approximately million based on the value of the remaining scheduled interest payments on the senior notes being prepaid 
the company expensed the make whole premium of million as well as unamortized debt issuance costs related to the senior notes of million in the third quarter of fiscal on october   the company amended the credit facility with its lenders to increase the credit facility to million from million  extend the maturity date to june  and amend certain other terms and covenants 
the credit facility bears interest at either i libor plus between and or ii the prime rate or iii an overnight rate at the option of the company 
the applicable interest rate is based upon the company s ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
in addition  the company is required to pay a commitment fee of between and on the unused portion of the credit facility 
on december   the company amended the credit facility with its lenders primarily to eliminate a financial covenant restricting aggregate capital expenditures to of consolidated depreciation expense in any fiscal year 
the company s obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by the company s subsidiaries 
capital expenditures were approximately million for the year ended march   primarily for manufacturing machinery and equipment used to expand capacity or replace old equipment at several facilities 
the indentures under the debt agreements described above and the credit facility contain restrictions and covenants which include limitations on the company s ability to incur additional indebtedness  issue stock options or warrants  make certain restricted payments and acquisitions  create liens  enter into transactions with affiliates  sell substantial portions of its assets and pay cash dividends 
additional covenants require compliance with financial tests  including leverage  interest coverage ratio  and maintenance of minimum net worth 
at march   there were million in borrowings and million in letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility 
at march   there were million in borrowings and million in letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility 
the level of unused borrowing capacity under the company s revolving credit facility varies from time to time depending in part upon its compliance with financial and other covenants set forth in the related agreement 
the company is currently in compliance with all such covenants 
as of march   the company had borrowing capacity under the credit facility of million  after reductions for borrowings and letters of credit outstanding 
effective april  the company entered into a settlement agreement with a customer relating to a long term supply agreement ltsa 
the ltsa is related to the company s acquisition of rolls royce gear systems  inc in fiscal the company has been producing the component parts for this ltsa at a loss for approximately one year which has been reserved for through a loss contract reserve 
the agreement provides for the parties to establish a transition plan that provides for the customer to re source the component parts from other suppliers  essentially terminating the company s requirement to provide future deliveries of these component parts 
the agreement establishes a date no later than december  for completion of the re sourcing effort  as well as providing a cap on the number of units during this time period 
additionally  the company will be required to make four payments of million each over the next two years  upon successful transition of the component parts  by the customer  to other vendors 
the company has recorded the estimated impact of this settlement in its march  balance sheet  which did not result in a significant adjustment to the recorded loss reserve 
the recorded loss reserve at march  was million 
if the transition is completed earlier than december or  the number of delivered units produced by the company is less than the cap established in the settlement agreement  the recorded loss reserve may be in excess of the amount required 
because we cannot determine the extent of re sourcing that may occur or the timing of the re sourcing  we will monitor progress and make appropriate adjustments  as may be necessary  to the loss contract reserve on a periodic basis 
capital expenditures were approximately million for the fiscal year ended march  primarily for manufacturing machinery and equipment 
we funded these expenditures through borrowings under our credit facility 
we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of to million for our fiscal year ending march  the expenditures are expected to be used mainly to expand capacity or replace old equipment at several facilities 
our expected future cash flows for the next five years for long term debt  leases and other obligations are as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years in thousands debt principal debt interest operating leases purchase obligations other long term obligations total included in the company s balance sheet at march  includes fixed rate interest only 
includes interest component 
we believe that cash generated by operations and borrowings under the credit facility will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements for our current operations 
however  we have a stated policy to grow through acquisitions and are continuously evaluating various acquisition opportunities 
as a result  we currently are pursuing the potential purchase of a number of candidates 
in the event that more than one of these transactions are successfully consummated  the availability under the credit facility might be fully utilized and additional funding sources may be needed 
there can be no assurance that such funding sources will be available to us on terms favorable to us  if at all 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations  and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management s judgment 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions 
for additional accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
in determining the appropriate allowance  we consider a combination of factors  such as industry trends  our customers financial strength and credit standing  and payment and default history 
the calculation of the required allowance requires a judgment as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable and historically have not resulted in material adjustments in subsequent periods when the estimates are adjusted to actual amounts 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the average cost or specific identification methods 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those anticipated  inventory adjustments may be required 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable and historically have not resulted in material adjustments in subsequent periods when the estimates are adjusted to actual amounts 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized in accordance with the contract terms when products are shipped  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  pricing is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
reserves for contract losses are accrued when estimated costs to complete exceed expected future revenues 
the company s policy with respect to sales returns and allowances generally provides that the customer may not return products or be given allowances  except at the company s option 
accruals for sales returns  other allowances  and estimated warranty costs are provided at the time of shipment based upon past experience 
goodwill and intangible assets under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and intangible assets sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  rather  they are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis 
additionally  intangible assets with finite lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
the company s operating segments of aerospace systems and aftermarket services are also the reporting units under sfas no 
each operating segment has a president who is responsible for managing the segment and reporting to the president and ceo of the company  the company s chief operating decision maker codm  as defined in sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
each of the operating segments is comprised of a number of operating units which are considered to be components under sfas no 
the operating units  for which discrete financial information is available  are aggregated for purposes of goodwill impairment testing 
the company s acquisition strategy is to acquire companies that complement and enhance the capabilities of the operating segments of the company 
each acquisition is assigned to either the aerospace systems reporting unit or the aftermarket services reporting unit 
the goodwill that results from each acquisition is also assigned to the reporting unit to which the acquisition is allocated  because it is that reporting unit which is intended to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition 
sfas no 
requires a two step impairment test for goodwill 
the first step is to compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit s assets to the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  then the second step is required to be completed  which involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to each asset and liability  with the excess being implied goodwill 
an impairment loss occurs if the amount of the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill 
the determination of the fair value of our reporting units is based  among other things  on estimates of future operating performance of the reporting unit being valued 
we are required to complete an impairment test for goodwill and record any resulting impairment losses annually 
changes in market conditions  among other factors  may have an impact on these estimates 
we completed our required annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal and determined that there was no impairment 
for our impairment test  we use market multiples from an external source for an average of stock price to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for certain companies in the aerospace and defense markets in computing the fair value of each reporting unit 
in the event that market multiples for stock price to ebitda in the aerospace and defense markets decrease  or the expected ebitda for our reporting units decreases  a goodwill impairment charge may be required  which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
no impairment charges have been incurred since the adoption of sfas no

sfas no 
also requires an employer to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of its year end statement of financial position  with limited exceptions 
the recognition and disclosures under sfas no 
are required as of the end of fiscal years ending after december   while the new measurement date is effective for fiscal years ending after december  the company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of this statement as of march  and included in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax  as of march   the gains and losses and prior service costs and credits that  pursuant to sfas no 
and  have not been recognized as components of net periodic benefit costs 
the company also recognized in its consolidated balance sheet a liability that represents the funded status of its various defined benefit pension and postretirement plans
