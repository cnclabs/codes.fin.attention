item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion highlights the significant factors affecting amcore financial  inc and subsidiaries amcore or the company consolidated financial condition as of december  compared to december   and the consolidated results of operations for the three years ended december  the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements  and selected financial data appearing elsewhere within this report 
factors influencing forward looking statements this report on form k contains  and periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission and written or oral statements made by the company s officers and directors to the press  potential investors  securities analysts and others will contain  forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities act of  and the company intends that such forward looking statements be subject to the safe harbors created thereby with respect to  among other things  the financial condition  results of operations  plans  objectives  future performance and business of amcore 
statements that are not historical facts  including statements about beliefs and expectations  are forward looking statements 
these statements are based upon beliefs and assumptions of amcore s management and on information currently available to such management 
the use of the words believe  expect  anticipate  plan  estimate  should  may  will or similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made  and amcore undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements in light of new information or future events 
contemplated  projected  forecasted or estimated results in such forward looking statements involve certain inherent risks and uncertainties 
a number of factors many of which are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict could cause actual results to differ materially from those in its forward looking statements 
these factors include  among others  the following possibilities i heightened competition  including specifically the intensification of price competition  the entry of new competitors and the formation of new products by new or existing competitors  ii adverse state  local and federal legislation and regulation or adverse findings or rulings made by local  state or federal regulators or agencies regarding amcore and its operations  iii failure to obtain new customers and retain existing customers  iv inability to carry out marketing and or expansion plans  v ability to attract and retain key executives or personnel  vi changes in interest rates including the effect of prepayment  vii general economic and business conditions which are less favorable than expected  viii equity and fixed income market fluctuations  ix unanticipated changes in industry trends  x unanticipated changes in credit quality and risk factors  xi success in gaining regulatory approvals when required  xii changes in federal reserve board monetary policies  xiii unexpected outcomes on existing or new litigation in which amcore  its subsidiaries  officers  directors or employees are named defendants  xiv technological changes  xv changes in us generally accepted accounting principles  xvi changes in assumptions or conditions affecting the application of critical accounting estimates  xvii inability of third party vendors to perform critical services for the company or its customers  xviii disruption of operations caused by the conversion and installation of data processing systems  and xix zoning restrictions or other limitations at the local level  which could prevent limited branch offices from transitioning to full service facilities 
critical accounting estimates the financial condition and results of operations for amcore presented in the consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements  selected financial data appearing elsewhere within this report  and management s discussion and analysis are  to a large degree  dependent upon the company s accounting policies 
the selection and application of these accounting policies involve judgments  estimates and uncertainties that are susceptible to change 

table of contents presented below are discussions of those accounting policies that management believes require its most difficult  subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain critical accounting estimates and are most important to the portrayal and understanding of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  and depending upon the severity of such changes  the possibility of materially different portrayal of financial condition or results of operations is a reasonable likelihood

allowance for loan losses loans  the company s largest income earning asset category  are periodically evaluated by management in order to establish an adequate allowance for loan losses allowance to absorb estimated losses that are probable as of the respective reporting date 
this evaluation includes specific loss estimates on certain individually reviewed loans where it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all of the amounts due principal or interest according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement impaired loans and statistical loss estimates for loan groups or pools that are based on historical loss experience  as adjusted for other loss estimates that are based upon the size  quality  and concentration characteristics of the various loan portfolios  adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay  and current economic and industry conditions  among other things 
additions to the allowance are charged against earnings for the period as a provision for loan losses provision 
conversely  this evaluation could result in a decrease in the allowance and provision 
actual loan losses are charged against and reduce the allowance when management believes that the collection of principal will not occur 
unpaid interest attributable to prior years for loans that are placed on non accrual status is also charged against and reduces the allowance 
unpaid interest for the current year for loans that are placed on non accrual status is charged against and reduces the interest income previously recognized 
subsequent recoveries of amounts previously charged to the allowance  if any  are credited to and increase the allowance 
the allowance is also subject to periodic examination by regulators whose review includes a determination as to its adequacy to absorb probable losses 
those judgments and assumptions that are most critical to the application of this accounting policy are the initial and on going creditworthiness of the borrower  the amount and timing of future cash flows of the borrower that are available for repayment of the loan  the sufficiency of underlying collateral  the enforceability of third party guarantees  the frequency and subjectivity of loan reviews and risk gradings  emerging or changing trends that might not be fully captured in the historical loss experience  and charges against the allowance for actual losses that are greater or less than previously estimated 
these judgments and assumptions are dependent upon or can be influenced by a variety of factors including the breadth and depth of experience of lending officers  credit administration and the corporate loan review staff that periodically review the status of the loan  changing economic and industry conditions  changes in the financial condition of the borrower and changes in the value and availability of the underlying collateral and guarantees 
while the company strives to reflect all known risk factors in its evaluations  judgment errors may occur 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the amount and timing of interest income and loan losses could be materially different 
these factors are most pronounced during economic downturns and may continue into an economic recovery  as specific credit performance may not be immediately affected by the stress of the downturn 
since  as described above  so many factors can affect the amount and timing of losses on loans  it is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty the effect to income if different conditions or assumptions were to prevail 
nonetheless  if any combination of the above judgments or assumptions were to have adversely affected the adequacy of the allowance by ten percent during  an additional provision of million may have been necessary

mortgage servicing rights the company recognizes as separate assets the right to service mortgage loans for others and collects a fee for doing so 
because it is retained as an asset  the amount allocated to mortgage servicing rights will have a favorable impact on the amount of gain or loss that is recognized on the sale of the loans 

table of contents the mortgage servicing rights asset is amortized in proportion to the principal amortization of the underlying loan portfolios that are being serviced 
amortization of the servicing rights asset will reduce the amount of income that is recorded in the respective period from the servicing of the mortgage loans 
each reporting period  the company re evaluates the fair value of its remaining mortgage servicing rights asset 
the amount by which the unamortized carrying amount of mortgage servicing rights exceeds the new estimate of fair value is charged against earnings for the period 
rather than directly reducing the unamortized carrying amount of the servicing rights asset  a valuation allowance is established for the same amount as the charge against earnings 
in subsequent reporting periods  depending upon current estimates of fair value  the valuation allowance may be reversed 
the reversal is limited to the remaining amount of the valuation allowance and will result in an increase in earnings in such period 
the periodic re evaluation of fair value is based upon current estimates of the present value of remaining net servicing cash flows that incorporate numerous assumptions including the cost of servicing the loans  discount rates  prepayment rates and default rates 
this re evaluation is performed by stratifying mortgage servicing rights assets into pools based upon loan type and investor 
valuation allowances are recorded for each defined pool  as applicable 
valuation allowances required for one pool cannot be offset by the amount that the fair value of another pool exceeds its unamortized carrying amount 
judgments and assumptions that are most critical to the application of this accounting policy are prepayment speeds that will determine the amount and period of servicing revenue that is expected to be earned  appropriate risk weighted discount rates used to determine the present value of estimated net future cash flows  estimated interest earned on amounts collected for real estate tax and property insurance premiums that are held in escrow until payment is due and estimated costs to service the loans 
these assumptions are based upon actual performance of the underlying loans and the general market consensus regarding changes in mortgage and other interest rates 
for example  declining mortgage interest rates typically result in accelerated mortgage prepayments  which tend to shorten the life and reduce the value of the servicing rights asset 
if different assumptions and conditions were to prevail  materially different amortization and valuation allowances than those that were recorded may be required 
since  as described above  so many factors can affect the value of mortgage servicing rights  it is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty the effect to income if different conditions or assumptions were to prevail 
nonetheless  if any combination of the above judgments or assumptions were to have adversely affected their fair value by ten percent beyond their carrying value at december   an impairment charge of million would have been necessary

loan securitizations and sale of receivables the company periodically sells certain indirect automobile loans in securitization transactions the auto loan sales 
upon the sale  the net carrying amount of the loans are removed from the consolidated balance sheet in exchange for cash and certain retained residual interests 
the retained interests include rights to service the loans that are sold the servicing rights and an interest in residual cash flows the interest only strip 
the interest only strip includes the excess of interest collected on the loans over the amount required to be paid to the investors and the securitization agent the excess spread plus an interest in sales proceeds that are not remitted by the securitization trust at the time of the initial sale of the loans to the extent it exceeds projected credit losses the credit enhancement or overcollateralization 
the carrying value of the loans removed from the balance sheet includes the unpaid principal balance of the loans  net of an allocable portion of the allowance for loan losses  minus the portion of the carrying value of the loans that are allocated to the retained residual interests 
because they are retained assets  the amount allocated and recorded for the residual interests has a favorable impact on the amount of gain or loss that is recognized upon the sale of the loans 

table of contents since the projected income from the servicing rights has approximated what is considered adequate compensation for servicing the loans  no asset or liability is recorded for servicing rights 
income from servicing is recognized as earned pursuant to the terms of the servicing agreement and to the extent cash collections from the borrowers exceed payments to the investors and agent 
cash collections in excess of the servicing rights income that is earned is next applied to the interest only strip 
the value allocated to the interest only strip is reduced and interest income is recorded assuming a constant yield based upon the discount rate used to estimate its fair value 
at the end of the estimated life of the securitization  the carrying value of the interest only strip that is attributable to the excess spread will be fully amortized 
at that time  the carrying value of the interest only strip that is attributable to the overcollateralization will have accreted to the cash that is expected to be released by the securitization trust 
because the company s retained residual interests are subordinated to the interests of securitization investors and the trust agent  there are risks that the carrying value of the interest only strip will not be fully recovered  which would result in a charge to earnings 
these include the risk that the asset will have a shorter life than originally estimated prepayment risk  that actual credit losses may exceed expected credit losses credit risk and that interest paid to the securitization trust and investors will be greater than projected interest rate risk 
the company s risk of loss attributable to credit and prepayment risk is limited to its interest in the interest only strip 
neither the investors nor the securitization trust have any further recourse to the company s other assets 
the company s risk of loss attributable to interest rate risk could exceed the company s interest in the excess spread  but such a possibility is not considered probable as of december  each reporting period  the fair value of the interest only strip is evaluated based upon current estimates and assumptions of the net present value of residual future cash flows net of remaining expected credit losses and anticipated refunds of overcollateralization 
changes in fair value are generally recorded net of tax as a component of other comprehensive income oci 
if this evaluation results in fair values that are less than the amortized carrying value of the interest only strip  and if the decline is considered other than temporary  in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained interests in securitized financial assets  the decline is charged against earnings for the current period 
finally  each reporting period  new interest only strip amortization schedules are developed based upon current estimates  assumptions  adjusted carrying values and revised constant yields 
judgments and assumptions that are most critical to the application of this accounting policy are estimated defaults  delinquencies and credit losses  projected prepayment speeds  projected interest rates  and discount rates 
these assumptions are based upon demonstrated credit performance  the prepayment history of the underlying loans and market consensus on future interest rates 
these are  in turn  most highly influenced by general economic conditions  with the greatest adverse effect during economic downturns and periods of rapidly changing interest rates 
if different assumptions and conditions were to prevail  noticeably different results could occur because the recorded value of the interest only strip may need to be written off or written down faster than planned and cash flows from the retained residual interests may be less than expected 
since  as described above  so many factors can affect the value of the interest only strip  it is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty the affect on income if different conditions or assumptions were to prevail 
nonetheless  if any combination of the above judgments or assumptions were to have adversely affected their value by an additional ten percent and the decline was determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge of  would have been necessary

img in key initiatives and other significant events key initiatives branch expansion the company s banking operations bank launched a branch expansion initiative during targeting the area generally bounded by interstates in the north  and in the east  in the south and and in the west the branch expansion 
the branch expansion strategy initially targets markets where there are high concentrations of mid size businesses  with a seasoned commercial lending and treasury management sales staff in a leased facility limited branch office or lbo 
once a book of business is developed and the lbo becomes profitable  plans to develop a permanent site for a full service facility in a nearby area that is surrounded by a high concentration of homeowners with strong population and household income growth are initiated 
increased capabilities in the markets served by these facilities  in addition to better brand recognition  are expected to accelerate the company s ability to generate bank issued deposits  which will better support loan growth and decrease the use of wholesale funding 
since the inception of the branch expansion strategy in april  new branches  net of closed offices  have opened 
the new locations have contributed billion in loans and million in deposits outstanding as of december  same store contributions  which include new branches that have been open at least one year  
table of contents were billion in loans and million in deposits outstanding at december  during  the company opened six net new branches in the chicago suburbs of joliet  wheaton  northbrook  lombard  wheaton and woodridge  illinois  a branch within the city limits of chicago  belvidere  illinois and wauwatosa  wisconsin  a milwaukee suburb 
the company has regulatory approval to open additional branches 
by the end of  the company expects to have two thirds of its branches located in markets that the company believes exhibit strong growth characteristics 
to date  the company s board of directors has authorized a capital investment of million to fund the company s branch expansion 
as of december   million of the total million capital commitment remained to be spent 
as a complement to its branch expansion  the bank has also expanded its automated teller machine system atms  which includes both owned and third party operated  to in illinois and in wisconsin  or overall at december  from in illinois and in wisconsin  or overall  at december  these amounts include additional atms located in walgreens drug stores primarily throughout wisconsin as part of a co branding relationship 
the placement of additional atms is an important part of amcore s commitment to provide quality customer service as additional atms provide amcore customers greater ease and convenience in completing banking transactions 
impact of inflation apart from operating expenses  the financial services industry is not directly affected by inflation  however  as the fed monitors economic trends and developments  it may change monetary policy in response to economic changes which would have an influence on interest rates 
see discussion of net interest income  changes due to rate  below 
quality loan growth improving credit quality is part of amcore s quality loan growth initiative 
average loans rose million to billion during  an increase over over the same period of time  total non performing loans increased or million to million  and was comprised of an million increase in non accrual loans and a decrease of million in loans ninety days past due and still accruing 
the increase included a million commercial real estate loan with a specific loss allocation of million at december  deposit growth average bank issued deposits grew to billion in  an increase of  or million  compared to billion in the modest increase reflects the company s efforts to ensure that its deposit attraction strategies are priced at competitive  but profitable  levels 
as a result  some customers  including correspondent banks  moved balances to other institutions 
amcore continues to focus on transactional deposit growth  such as checking accounts  which helps lower funding costs  as well as increasing the number of households served by the company 
handling a customer s checking account enables the bank to cross sell other products and increases the likelihood of retaining their business over time 
the company s goal is to become the customer s primary bank  meeting all of their banking  mortgage and investment needs 
over the last year  the total number of households served by amcore increased by 
on the commercial side  the company s main emphasis is on cash management products  including remote deposit capture  as it focuses on its core niche of mid size commercial customers 
amcore s focus is on competitive yet profitably priced bank issued deposit growth because it provides a source of funding for the branch expansion and the quality loan growth initiatives  and is also a means of reducing reliance on wholesale funding sources that may be at a higher cost 
customer attraction strategies during  especially in the newer markets  included a market segment of high initial rates for transaction and savings account balances 
while this strategy did initially bring in balances  as rates rose these customers migrated to cds and other high rate products within the bank or to other institutions once the high initial rates expired 
this strategy was being phased out in  and a more market oriented  spread based deposit sales strategy that focuses on pricing at competitive but profitable levels is being emphasized 

table of contents increasing fee income increasing fee income  specifically from the investment management and trust segment imt and mortgage banking segment  is an area of increased management attention 
as of the end of  imt completed its migration to an open architecture sales platform  which has allowed greater customer access to non proprietary products 
this included the transition of million in assets of three company managed vintage equity funds into two mutual funds managed by federated investors  inc federated in september and the sale of the asset management subsidiary  investors management group  ltd 
img  to west bancorporation  inc west banc on december  with these transactions  amcore has transitioned from being a developer of proprietary investment products to being a provider that can offer its customers a wider array of investment product choices 
the results of img for prior periods and the related sale are reported as discontinued operations 
the changes in the business due to the combined impact of the federated and west banc transactions resulted in slower income growth initially  however imt income for was million  up million or from million on january   the company announced a strategic arrangement with a leading national mortgage services company to provide private label loan processing and servicing support 
as part of this arrangement  the company sold its originated mortgage servicing rights portfolio 
the arrangement will offer amcore a greater breadth of products  more competitive pricing and greater processing efficiencies and is expected to better position the company for future loan origination growth 
with the arrangement  amcore expects to better control risks and costs associated with its mortgage business 
the sale of the company originated mortgage servicing rights portfolio will occur during the first quarter the transition to the new processing and servicing arrangement will continue into the second quarter of capital efficiency and deployment the company s priorities with respect to effectively deploying capital include a more structured pricing discipline that targets profitable growth on both sides of the balance sheet  migration of the balance sheet away from lower spread investments to higher spread loans and buying back its common shares 
on may   the company announced that its board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program repurchase program of up to three million common shares  or approximately of diluted shares outstanding 
the repurchase authorization is for a twelve month period

earnings review of consolidated statements of income the following highlights a comparative discussion of the major components of net income and their impact for the last three years 
net interest income net interest income is the difference between income earned on interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
the interest income on certain loans and investment securities is not subject to federal income tax 
for analytical purposes  the interest income and rates on these types of assets are adjusted to a fully taxable equivalent  or fte basis 
the fte adjustment was calculated using amcore s statutory federal income tax rate of 
overview fte adjusted interest income is as follows in thousands years ended december  interest income book basis fte adjustment interest income fte basis interest expense net interest income fte basis net interest income on an fte basis increased million or in and increased million or in the increases for both and were primarily driven by an increase in average loan volumes of 
loan yields also contributed with increases of basis points in and basis points in these were partially offset by increases in interest expense of and  respectively  in and net interest spread is the difference between the average rates on interest earning assets and the average rates on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average earning assets 
these ratios can also be used to analyze net interest income 
since a portion of the company s funding is derived from interest free sources  primarily demand deposits  other liabilities and stockholders equity  the effective rate paid for all funding sources is lower than the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities alone 

table of contents as table indicates  the net interest spread declined basis points to in from in  and decreased basis points in from the level of 
the net interest margin was in  a decline of basis points from in the level was a decrease of five basis points from in the declines in spread and margin for both periods were driven by higher funding costs  the result of continued increases in short term interest rates  deposit attraction strategies and tightening product spreads resulting from improved credit conditions and increased competitive pressures 
the level of net interest income is the result of the relationship between the total volume and mix of interest earning assets and the rates earned and the total volume and mix of interest bearing liabilities and the rates paid 
the rate and volume components associated with interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can be segregated to analyze the period to period changes in net interest income 
changes due to rate volume variances have been allocated between changes due to average volume and changes due to average rate based on the absolute value of each to the total change of both categories 
table analyzes the changes attributable to the volume and rate components of net interest income 
changes due to volume in  net interest income fte increased due to average volume by million when compared to this increase was comprised of a million increase in interest income that was partially offset by a million increase in interest expense 
in  net interest income fte increased due to average volume by million 
this was comprised of a million increase in interest income that was partially offset by a million increase in interest expense

table of contents earnings review by business segment amcore s internal reporting and planning process focuses on four primary lines of business segment s commercial banking  retail banking  investment management and trust  and mortgage banking 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements presents a condensed income statement and total assets for each segment 
the financial information presented was derived from the company s internal profitability reporting system that is used by management to monitor and manage the financial performance of the company 
this information is based on internal management accounting policies which have been developed to reflect the underlying economics of the segments and  to the extent practicable  to portray each segment as if it operated on a stand alone basis 
thus  each segment  in addition to its direct revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities  includes an allocation of shared support function expenses 
the commercial  retail and mortgage banking segments also include funds transfer adjustments to appropriately reflect the cost of funds on loans made and funding credits on deposits generated 
apart from these adjustments  the accounting policies used are similar to those described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
since there are no comprehensive authorities for management accounting equivalent to us generally accepted accounting principles  the information presented is not necessarily comparable with similar information from other financial institutions 
in addition  methodologies used to measure  assign and allocate certain items may change from time to time to reflect  among other things  accounting estimate refinements  changes in risk profiles  changes in customers or product lines  and changes in management structure 
as a result of the federated and west banc transactions  the results of img for the current and prior periods are reported as discontinued operations 
total segment results differ from consolidated results primarily due to inter segment eliminations  certain corporate administration costs  items not otherwise allocated in the management accounting process and treasury and investment activities

s 
government sponsored enterprises and state and political subdivisions and included the resale of million of the company s own issuance of a trust preferred security that it had repurchased a few years ago 
as a result of the sale  the company realized an improvement in its regulatory capital  paid down short term borrowings  and reduced the level of required capital 
among the factors affecting the decision to purchase or sell securities are the current assessment of economic and financial conditions  including the interest rate environment  regulatory capital levels  the liquidity needs of the company  and its pledging obligations 
by not reinvesting cash flows from maturities and prepayments of investment securities  the company is migrating its balance sheet to a lower proportion of investment securities 
mortgage and asset backed securities as of december  totaled million and represent of total available for sale securities 
the distribution of mortgage and asset backed securities includes million of us government sponsored enterprise gse mortgage backed pass through securities  million of gse collateralized mortgage obligations and million of private issue collateral mortgage obligations  all of which are rated aaa 
the million of total securities available for sale includes gross unrealized gains of million and gross unrealized losses of million 
unrealized gains and unrealized losses is the difference between a security s fair value and carrying value 
the fair value of a security is generally influenced by two factors  market risk and credit risk 
market risk is the exposure of the security to changes in interest rate 
there is an inverse relationship to changes in the fair value of the security with changes in interest rates  meaning that when rates increase the value of the security will decrease 
conversely  when rates decline the value of the security will increase 
credit risk arises from the extension of credit to a counter party  for example a purchase of corporate debt in security form  and the possibility that the counter party may not meet its contractual obligations 
the company s policy is to invest in securities with low credit risk  such as us treasuries  us government agencies such as the government national mortgage association or gnma  government sponsored enterprises gse s such as the federal home loan mortgage corporation or fhlmc  state and political obligations  and mortgage backed securities 
unlike agency debt  gse debt is not secured by the full faith and credit of the united states 
the combined effect of the company s gross unrealized gains and gross unrealized losses  net of tax  is included as accumulated oci in stockholders equity  as none of the securities with gross unrealized losses are considered other than temporarily impaired 
if it is determined that an investment is impaired and the impairment is other than temporary  an impairment loss is reclassified from oci as a charge to earnings and a new carrying basis for the investment is established 
for comparative purposes  at december   gross unrealized gains of million and gross unrealized losses of million were included in the securities available for sale portfolio

such transactions serve a variety of purposes including management of the company s interest rate risk  liquidity and credit concentration risks  optimization of capital utilization  meeting the financial needs of its customers and fulfilling community reinvestment act cra obligations in the markets that it serves 
auto loan sales structured as sales pursuant to sfas accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities  auto loan sales are a component of the company s liquidity and credit concentration risk management strategy 
the auto loan sales are also helpful as a capital management tool 
in the auto loan sales  indirect automobile loan receivables are transferred to a multi seller variable interest entity vie 
since the company is not the primary beneficiary of the vie  consolidation is not required under the terms of financial interpretation no 
fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities 
as a result  the net carrying amount of the loans is removed from the consolidated balance sheet and certain retained residual interests are recorded 
the company s retained interests are subordinate to the interests of investors in the vie and are subject to prepayment risk  interest rate risk and credit risk on the transferred auto loans 
the company s risk of loss attributable to credit and prepayment is limited to its interest in the interest only strip 
neither the investors nor the securitization trust have any further recourse to the company s other assets 
interest rate risk could exceed the company s interest in the excess spread  but such a possibility is not considered probable as of december  the company also retains the rights to service the loans that are sold 
as of december   the balance of automobile loans serviced and not included on the company s consolidated balance sheet was million  compared to million at december  the carrying value of retained interests was million and million at the end of and  respectively

asset quality review and credit risk management amcore s credit risk is centered in its loan portfolio  which totaled billion  or of earning assets  including coli on december  the objective in managing loan portfolio risk is to quantify and manage credit risk on a portfolio basis as well as reduce the risk of a loss resulting from a customer s failure to perform according to the terms of a transaction 
to achieve this objective  amcore strives to maintain a loan portfolio that is diverse in terms of loan type  industry concentration and borrower concentration 
the company is also exposed to carrier credit risk with respect to the majority of its million investment in coli 
amcore manages this risk by diversifying its holdings among multiple carriers and by periodic internal credit reviews 
all carriers have secure ratings from a

allowance for loan losses the allowance is a significant estimate that is regularly reviewed by management to determine whether or not the amount is considered adequate to absorb probable losses 
if not  an additional provision is made to increase the allowance 
conversely  this review could result in a decrease in the allowance 
this evaluation includes specific loss estimates on certain individually reviewed loans  statistical loss estimates for loan groups or pools that are based on historical loss experience  and loss estimates that are based upon the size  quality and concentration characteristics of the various loan portfolios  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  and current economic and industry conditions

see critical accounting estimates for a discussion of the judgments and assumptions that are most critical in determining the adequacy of the allowance 
in addition to the amount of non accruing and delinquent loans over days past due  management is aware that other possible credit problems of borrowers may exist

liquidity and capital management liquidity management overview liquidity management is the process by which the company  through its asset and liability committee alco and capital markets and treasury function  ensures that adequate liquid funds are available to meet its financial commitments on a timely basis  at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances 
liquidity is derived primarily from bank issued deposit growth and retention  principal and interest payments on loans  principal and interest payments  sale  maturity and prepayment of investment securities  net cash provided from operations  and access to other funding sources 
other funding sources include brokered cds  fed funds purchased lines  federal reserve bank discount window advances  fhlb advances  repurchase agreements  the sale or securitization of loans  subordinated debentures  balances maintained at correspondent banks and access to other capital market instruments 
bank issued deposits  which exclude wholesale deposits  are considered by management to be the primary  most stable and most cost effective source of funding and liquidity 
the bank also has capacity  over time  to place additional brokered cd s as a source of mid to long term funds 
uses of liquidity include funding credit obligations to borrowers  funding of mortgage originations pending delivery to the secondary market  withdrawals by depositors  repayment of debt when due or called  maintaining adequate collateral for public deposits  paying dividends to shareholders  payment of operating expenses  funding capital expenditures and maintaining deposit reserve requirements 
during  wholesale funding  which includes borrowings and brokered deposits  decreased million 
wholesale funding represented of total assets as of the end of both and the company remains confident of its ability to meet and manage its short and long term liquidity needs 
investment securities portfolio scheduled maturities of the company s investment securities portfolio and the prepayment of mortgage and asset backed securities represent a significant source of liquidity 
approximately million  or  of the securities portfolio will contractually mature in see table this does not include mortgage and asset backed securities since their payment streams may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations  typically without penalty 
for example  scheduled maturities for  excluding mortgage and asset backed securities  were million  whereas proceeds from actual maturities  which included prepayments of mortgage and asset backed securities  were million 
this compares to proceeds of million and million in and  respectively 

table of contents at december   securities available for sale were million or of total assets compared to billion or at december  by not reinvesting cash flows from maturities and prepayments of investment securities  the company expects to continue to gradually migrate its balance sheet to a lower proportion of investment securities  while using the proceeds to fund the quality loan growth initiative and reduce higher cost wholesale funding 
loans funding of loans is the most significant liquidity need  representing of total assets as of december  since december   loans increased million 
loans held for sale  which represents mortgage origination funding awaiting delivery to the secondary market  declined million 
the scheduled repayments and maturities of loans represent a substantial source of liquidity 
table shows for selected loan categories that million in maturities are scheduled for loan growth from same store and branch expansion continue to be the greatest liquidity need of the company 
bank issued deposits bank issued deposits are the most cost effective and reliable source of liquidity for the company 
during  bank issued deposits declined million 
scheduled maturities of time deposits of  or more  as reflected in table  are million in  of which million are bank issued 
branch expansion the company s branch expansion strategy poses the greatest challenge to short and long term liquidity 
the branch expansion has required  and will continue to require  other sources of liquidity to fund the expected loan growth net of expected deposit growth and the remaining million authorized capital investment 
through december   branch expansion has required the funding of billion in loans while generating million in deposits 
parent company in addition to the overall liquidity needs of the consolidated company  the parent company requires adequate liquidity to pay its expenses  repay debt when due  pay stockholder dividends and execute the repurchase program 
liquidity is primarily provided to the parent through the bank and other subsidiaries in the form of dividends 
in  dividends from subsidiaries amounted to million  compared to million in while the bank is limited in the amount of dividends it can pay  as of december   approximately million was available for payment to the parent in the form of dividends without prior regulatory approval  of which million could be paid without causing the bank to be less than well capitalized 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
other sources of liquidity as of december   other sources of potentially available liquidity totaled billion and included million of unfunded fed funds lines  unused collateral sufficient to support million in federal reserve bank discount window advances  million of unpledged debt investment securities  and million of fhlb advances 
these amounts totaled billion at december  and also included million available under a prior commercial paper and back up line of credit arrangement 
the company also has capacity  over time  to place sufficient amounts of brokered cds as a source of mid to long term liquidity 
the bank s indirect auto portfolio  which at december  was million  is a potential source of liquidity through loans sales or securitizations 
the bank also has a home equity portfolio of million 
certain of these loans could also be packaged and securitized but the bank has no current plans to do so 
other uses of liquidity at december   other potential uses of liquidity totaled billion and included million in commitments to extend credit  million in residential mortgage commitments primarily for sale to the secondary market  and million in letters of credit

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as part of its normal operations  amcore is subject to interest rate risk on the assets it invests in primarily loans and securities and the liabilities it funds with primarily customer deposits  brokered deposits and borrowed funds  as well as its ability to manage such risk 
fluctuations in interest rates may result in changes in the fair market values of amcore s financial instruments  cash flows and net interest income 
like most financial institutions  amcore has an exposure to changes in both short term and long term interest rates 
while amcore manages other risks in its normal course of operations  such as credit and liquidity risk  it considers interest rate risk to be its most significant market risk 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of amcore s business activities and operations 
in addition  since amcore does not hold a trading portfolio  it is not exposed to significant market risk from trading activities 
during  there were no material changes in amcore s primary market risk exposures 
based upon current expectations  no material changes are anticipated in the future in the types of market risks facing amcore 
table and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements summarize amcore s market risk and interest sensitivity position as of december  the amounts and assumptions should not be relied upon as indicative of expected actual results since  like most financial institutions  amcore s net income can be significantly influenced by external factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to overall economic conditions  policies and actions of regulatory authorities  the amounts of and rates at which assets and liabilities re price  variances in prepayment of loans and securities other than those that are assumed  early withdrawal of deposits  exercise of call options on borrowings or securities  competition  a general rise or decline in interest rates  changes in the slope of the yield curve  changes in historical relationships between indices and balance sheet growth 
amcore s asset and liability committee alco regularly review the assumptions being utilized in light of market conditions 
amcore s asset and liability management process is utilized to manage market and interest rate risk through structuring the balance sheet and off balance sheet positions to maximize net income while maintaining acceptable levels of risk to changes in market interest rates 
while achievement of this goal requires a balance between earnings  liquidity and interest rate risk  there are opportunities to enhance revenues through managed risk 
interest rate sensitivity analysis is performed monthly using various simulations with an asset liability modeling system 
these analyses are reviewed by the alco  whose actions attempt to minimize any sudden or sustained negative impact that interest rate movements may have on net interest income 
alco reviews the impact of liquidity  capital adequacy and rate sensitivity  among other things  and determines appropriate policy direction to maintain or meet established alco guidelines 
based upon an immediate increase in interest rates of basis points and no change in the slope of the yield curve  the potential decrease in pre tax income for would be approximately of base income 
at the end of  comparable assumptions would have resulted in a potential decrease in pre tax income of 
conversely  an immediate decrease in interest rates of basis points and no change in the slope of the yield curve  and incorporating the potential impairment of mortgage servicing rights would result in a potential decrease in pre tax income for of of base forecasted pre tax income 
subsequent to year end  an agreement was reached to sell the mortgage servicing right portfolio omsrs 
in the scenario where rates decreased immediately  the resulting faster prepayment speeds would likely lead to an impairment of the omsrs 
this accounted for a large percentage of the potential decrease in pre tax income in that scenario 
since an agreement was reached in the first quarter of to sell the omsrs  the bank s risk to an immediate decrease in rates was substantially reduced 
at the end of  a similar decrease in rates would have resulted in a potential decrease in pre tax income of 
this analysis assumes no growth in assets or liabilities and replacement of maturing instruments with like kind instruments 
during  amcore changed its benchmark of net interest income to pre tax income 
the amounts and assumptions used in the rising and falling rate scenarios should not be viewed as indicative of expected actual results 
in addition to rising or falling interest rates  amcore s net income can be significantly impacted by a variety of external factors  such as those previously noted 
in addition  as interest rates move  the alco is likely to adjust interest rate risk management strategies to limit  to the extent possible  the adverse impact that such changes in interest rates might otherwise have on amcore s net income  as well as maximize potential positive impacts such movements might have
