item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis presents the factors that had a material effect on our results of operations during the years ended december   and also discussed is our financial position as of the end of those periods 
you should read this discussion in conjunction with our consolidated and combined financial statements and the notes to those consolidated and combined financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements 
see forward looking statements for a discussion of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
introduction this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are intended to provide investors with an understanding of the historical performance of our business  its financial condition and its prospects 
the results of operations of our business after the spin off are and will continue to be significantly different than the results of operations of our business prior to the spin off 
this difference results from  among other things  the prices at which we sell pulp to kimberly clark after the spin off  which are significantly different than the prices reflected in transfers of pulp to other kimberly clark operations prior to the spin off  interest expense of new long term debt and incremental selling  general and administrative expenses related primarily to reduced economies of scale as a result of operating on a stand alone basis 
we will discuss and provide our analysis of the following overview of business  business segments  separation from kimberly clark  results of operations and related information  liquidity and capital resources  and critical accounting policies and use of estimates 
overview of business we are a leading international producer of premium fine papers and technical products 
we also produce bleached kraft market pulp in canada  where we own approximately  acres of timberlands and have non exclusive rights to harvest wood from approximately  acres of other timberlands 
we have three primary operations our fine paper business  our technical products business and our pulp business 
in managing this diverse paper and pulp business  management believes that achieving and maintaining a leadership position for our fine paper and technical products businesses  responding effectively to competitive challenges  employing capital optimally  controlling costs and managing currency  commodity and other risks are important to the long term success of the business 
the pulp cycle and general economic conditions also impact our results 
in this discussion and analysis  we will refer to these factors 
market leadership 
achieving and maintaining leadership for our fine paper and technical products businesses have been an important part of our past performance 
we have long been recognized as a leading manufacturer of world class premium writing  text and cover papers used in corporate annual reports  corporate identity packages  invitations  personal stationery and high end packaging 
maintaining our leadership is important to our results  particularly in light of the competitive environment in which we operate 
competitive environment 
our past results have been and future prospects will be significantly affected by the competitive environment in which we operate 
we experience intense competition for sales of our principal products in our major markets 
our paper business competes directly with well known competitors  some of which are larger and more diversified in most of our markets 
in our pulp business  we have experienced  and will continue to experience  intense competition from suppliers of softwood pulps and southern hemisphere suppliers of hardwood pulps 
we expect our competitors to continue to be aggressive in the future 
cost control 
to improve and maintain our competitive position  we must control our raw material  manufacturing  distribution and other costs 
a portion of our investments in capital improvements are intended to achieve cost savings and improvements in productivity 
cyclical nature of the pulp industry 
revenues in the pulp industry and our pulp business tend to be cyclical  with periods of shortage and rapidly rising market prices  leading to increased production and increased industry investment until supply exceeds demand 
those periods are then typically followed by periods of reduced market prices and excess and idle capacity until the cycle is repeated 
general economic conditions 
the markets for all of our products are affected to a significant degree by general economic conditions 
downturns and improvements in the us economy or in our export markets affect the demand for our products 
foreign currency and commodity risk 
sales of pulp by our canadian manufacturing facilities are invoiced in us dollars in accordance with industry practice  therefore  no currency effects are presented in our analysis of the change in net sales for our pulp operations 
however  we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates because most of the costs relating to our pulp business are incurred in canadian dollars 
these risks could have a material impact on our results of operations if not effectively managed 
the following charts illustrate changes in currency and pulp prices that occurred during the periods covered by this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations pulp price history average quarterly prices

business segments our fine paper business is a leading producer of premium writing  text  cover and specialty papers used in corporate annual reports  corporate identity packages  invitations  personal stationery and high end packaging 
our products include some of the most recognized and preferred papers in north america  where we enjoy leading market positions in many of our product categories 
we sell our products primarily to authorized paper distributors  converters and specialty businesses  with sales to distributors and distributor owned paper stores accounting for more than of sales 
we believe that our fine paper manufacturing facilities located in neenah and whiting  wisconsin are among the most efficient in their markets and make us one of the lowest cost producers 
our technical products business is a leading producer of durable  saturated and coated substrates for a variety of end uses 
we sell our technical products globally in product categories  and we focus on major categories where we believe we are a market leader  which include  among others  the tape  label  abrasive  filtration media  wallcovering  medical packaging and heat transfer technical products markets 
we are also a global supplier of materials used to create customer specific components for furniture  book covers and original equipment manufacturers products 
our customers are located in more than countries 
our technical products manufacturing facilities are located in munising  michigan and near munich and frankfurt  germany 
our pulp business consists of a mill located in pictou  nova scotia together with related timberlands 
the pictou mill is comprised of a single line pulp facility which produces primarily softwood pulp  as well as timberlands encompassing approximately  acres of owned and  acres of licensed or managed land in nova scotia 
in  the pictou mill produced approximately  metric tons of bleached kraft pulp 
separation from kimberly clark neenah paper  inc was incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware in april  as a wholly owned subsidiary of kimberly clark 
we had no material assets or activities until the transfer to us by kimberly clark of the businesses described in this annual report  which occurred immediately prior to the spin off in november prior to the spin off  kimberly clark had conducted such businesses through various divisions and subsidiaries 
following the spin off  we became an independent public company  and kimberly clark has no continuing ownership interest in us 
prior to the spin off  we entered into several agreements with kimberly clark in connection with the separation of our business from kimberly clark s businesses 
these agreements included a distribution agreement  a pulp supply agreement  a corporate services agreement  an employee matters agreement and a tax sharing agreement 
the distribution agreement provided for the transfer to us of the assets relating to kimberly clark s canadian pulp business and its fine paper and technical products business in the united states  and the assumption by us of the liabilities relating to these businesses 
the pulp supply agreement supports our transition from a captive pulp producer to a market supplier of pulp 
the employee matters agreement allocates responsibilities relating to employee compensation and benefit plans and programs and other related matters 
the tax sharing agreement governs tax obligations arising out of our business both before and after the spin off 
the corporate services agreement  which was terminated in january  facilitated an orderly transition from being a part of a larger company to a stand alone company 
results of operations and related information in this section  we discuss and analyze our net sales  income before interest and income taxes which we refer to as operating income in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other information relevant to an understanding of our results of operations for the years ended december   and executive summary results of discontinued operations manufacturing operations at the terrace bay mill were suspended in february due to a lack of wood fiber for its operations 
the mill s fiber supply was exhausted as a result of a strike by the approximately workers employed by the longlac woodlands operations that supplied wood fiber to the mill 
most of the approximately hourly and salaried workers employed at the mill were laid off during the two weeks following the suspension of manufacturing activities 
in  the terrace bay mill produced approximately  metric tons of pulp 
following the suspension of manufacturing operations  we fulfilled our contractual obligation to supply pulp to kimberly clark by shipping from the mill s inventory of finished goods 
the mill s inventory of finished goods was exhausted in july 
as a result  we notified kimberly clark that due to a force majeure event as defined in our pulp supply agreement we were unable to fulfill our obligations under the pulp supply agreement 
in may  we announced a tentative agreement to transfer the terrace bay mill to buchanan 
in august  we consummated the agreement by transferring the mill excluding certain working capital amounts and post employment obligations to buchanan 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  buchanan assumed responsibility for substantially all liabilities related to the future operation of the mill in exchange for a payment of million 
the terrace bay mill is composed of a single line pulp facility  which primarily produces softwood pulp  and a woodlands operation 
the terrace bay mill holds non exclusive rights under a sustainable forest license which was transferred to buchanan to harvest wood off approximately million acres of land owned by the province of ontario 
for the year ended december   net sales at the terrace bay mill of million decreased by million compared to the prior year due to the suspension of manufacturing operations in february for the year ended december   the terrace bay mill s operating loss of million decreased million from the prior year primarily due to restructuring costs and asset impairment losses of million in partially offset by the recognition of a loss of approximately million related to the curtailment and partial settlement of pension obligations to current retirees in the ontario  canada pension plan in excluding these items  the mill s operating loss decreased million as the costs incurred to maintain the mill during the suspension of manufacturing operations offset by revenue generated from the sale of finished goods inventories on hand were less than the losses incurred while operating the mill in in addition  we recognized a pre tax loss of million to recognize the loss on the assets transferred to buchanan 
at closing  we retained certain working capital amounts  primarily consisting of trade accounts receivable  finished goods inventory and trade accounts payable 
in addition  we retained long term disability obligations for current and former mill employees and post employment medical and life insurance liabilities for current retirees 
in conjunction with the transfer of mill employees to buchanan and as a closing condition of the agreement  we initiated plans to curtail and settle our ontario  canada defined benefit pension plan 
in august  we made a payment to the pension trust of approximately million for the purchase of annuity contracts to settle our pension liability for current retirees 
as a result of the transaction  we recognized a pension curtailment and settlement loss of approximately million 
in addition  we expect to record a settlement loss of approximately million related to the future settlement of pension obligations for active employees 
the amount of any funds that we may pay or receive and the timing of recognition of the loss to settle the liability for active employees are dependent upon  among other things  an actuarial determination of the value of the obligations being settled  the cost of annuity contracts  regulatory approval to settle the plan and employee elections 
for the year ended december   net sales at the terrace bay mill of million decreased million compared to the prior year primarily due to the closure of the no 
mill  and to a lesser extent  extended downtime to replenish wood chip inventories 
for the year ended december   the terrace bay mill s operating loss of million decreased million 
excluding restructuring costs and asset impairment losses of million and million in and  respectively  the operating loss for increased million from the prior year 
the unfavorable comparison was primarily due to higher discounts on pulp shipments to kimberly clark pursuant to our pulp supply agreement  unfavorable currency translation effects  increased fiber and energy related manufacturing costs and cost associated with our operation as a stand alone company 
these unfavorable factors were partially offset by lower maintenance spending  cost savings associated with the closure of the no 
mill and higher average prices for softwood pulp 
sale of woodlands in june  we completed the sale of approximately  acres of woodlands in nova scotia to atlantic star forestry ltd and nova star forestry ltd the purchaser for gross proceeds of million 
we received the total proceeds from the sale in cash at closing 
we also entered into a fiber supply agreement the fsa with the purchaser to secure a source of fiber for our pictou pulp mill 
following the sale  we have approximately  acres of owned and  acres of licensed or managed woodlands in nova scotia 
pursuant to the terms of the fsa  the purchaser is required to make available to us sufficient woodlands acreage to yield  metric tons of softwood timber annually 
we are required to bear all costs associated with harvesting the timber  and title to the timber transfers to us when the timber is cut 
timber purchases under the fsa are at market based prices subject to semi annual adjustment 
the fsa expires on december  and can be extended for an additional five years at our discretion 
the fsa can be extended for a subsequent five years upon the mutual agreement of us and the purchaser 
the fsa does not give us the option or right to reacquire the woodlands that were sold 
the sale qualified for gain recognition under the full accrual method described in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for sales of real estate fas 
our commitment to accept acreage offered by the purchaser to satisfy the timber requirements for the first months of the fsa represents a constructive obligation 
as a result  we recognized a pre tax gain on the sale of approximately million in the three months ended june  and deferred approximately million  which represents our estimated maximum exposure to loss  related to our constructive obligation under the fsa 
the deferral related to the constructive obligation will be amortized over the month term of such obligation 
during the last six months of  approximately million of such deferred gain was recognized in income 
acquisition of neenah germany in october  we completed our previously announced purchase of the outstanding interests of fibermark services gmbh co 
kg and the outstanding interests of fibermark beteiligungs gmbh together neenah germany 
neenah germany was acquired from fibermark  inc and fibermark international holdings llc for million in cash 
the transaction was financed through million of available cash and million of debt drawn against our revolving credit facility 
neenah germany has been included in the operating results of our technical products segment since the date of acquisition 
the assets acquired as a result of the acquisition of neenah germany consist of three mills located near munich and frankfurt germany  that produce a wide range of products  including transportation and other filter media  non woven wall coverings  masking and other tapes  abrasive backings  and specialized printing and coating substrates 
recent developments in march  we acquired the fox valley corporation  which owns fox river paper company  llc fox river 
we paid million in cash for the acquisition and financed it through a combination of cash and debt drawn against our existing revolving credit facility 
the assets acquired as a result of the acquisition of fox river consist of four us paper mills and various related assets  producing premium fine papers with well known brands including starwhite  sundance  esse and oxford 
the fox river assets will be operated as part of our fine paper business 
in conjunction with the acquisition of fox river  we announced plans to permanently close the housatonic mill  located near great barrington  massachusetts 
the housatonic mill  the smallest of the fine paper plants acquired in the fox river acquisition  has annual production capacity of approximately  tons per year and is expected to cease manufacturing operations by the end of the second quarter 
the housatonic mill was not profitable due to its small size  cost structure and the pricing of many of the grades made there 
closing the mill will allow us to eliminate costs and improve margins while still serving the needs of key customers 
we expect to incur one time cash costs of approximately million  which includes approximately million for employee severance pay and approximately million of other charges related to the closure 
see note of notes to consolidated and combined financial statements  subsequent events 
results of continuing operations net sales for the year ended december  increased million from the prior year primarily due to the acquisition of neenah germany in october excluding neenah germany  sales increased million or  primarily due to favorable average net selling prices for all our businesses and increased pulp shipments 
the increase in average net selling prices was primarily due to the realization of price increases on branded fine paper products  in our technical products business and higher market prices for softwood pulp 
higher prices were partially offset by marginally lower volumes in our fine paper and technical products businesses excluding neenah germany 
consolidated operating income for the year ended december  increased million compared to due to the gain on the sale of woodlands 
see sale of woodlands above 
excluding the gain on sale  consolidated operating income was million unfavorable to the prior year primarily due to unfavorable currency translation effects related to the strengthening of the canadian dollar compared to the us dollar  higher manufacturing input costs  an unfavorable comparison on pulp hedging activities and increased corporate expenses for stock based compensation and depreciation related to our enterprise resource planning erp software 
the unfavorable manufacturing costs were primarily due to higher raw material primarily fiber and latex  energy and employee benefit costs 
these unfavorable effects were partially offset by higher average net prices in all of our businesses  gains on currency hedges and cost savings 
on january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment fas r using the modified prospective transition method 
stock based compensation cost recognized under fas r for the year ended december  was million and consisted of a compensation cost for all unvested stock based grants outstanding as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  accounting for stock based compensation fas and b compensation cost for all stock based awards granted subsequent to adoption based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of fas r 
the adoption of fas r resulted in additional stock based compensation expense of million and income tax benefits of million and reduced earnings per diluted share by for the year ended december at december   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas which requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income 
sfas also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end statement of financial position 
we were not affected by the measurement provisions of sfas because the company currently measures the funded status of its benefit plans as of year end 
recognition of the funded status provisions of sfas reduced our stockholders equity on the consolidated balance sheet at december  by million

the decrease in operating working capital was primarily due to lower accounts receivable  partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable related to the timing of payments following the spin off 
our investment in operating working capital at december  decreased million from the prior year 
the decrease in operating working capital was primarily due to the depletion of finished goods inventory and the collection of related receivables at terrace bay prior to the transfer to buchanan 
this reduction was partially offset by working capital acquired in the neenah germany acquisition 
during  higher discounts on pulp shipments to kimberly clark and lower pulp volume resulted in lower accounts receivable and reduced our investment in operating working capital excluding the effects of a stronger canadian dollar relative to the us dollar 
our reduced investment in operating working capital due to lower accounts receivable was partially offset by an increase of million in inventories excluding the effects of a stronger canadian dollar relative to the us dollar 
we built pulp finished good inventories to comply with contractually required safety stock levels as we transitioned to being a supplier of market pulp 
during  higher average selling prices for pulp resulted in significantly higher accounts receivable and increased our investment in working capital at december  to million 
investing commentary cash used by investing activities for of million  increased million from the prior year period

capital spending in included significant amounts for the acquisition and installation of erp software and general projects in north america 
capital spending in of million was million higher than the comparable prior year period 
the increased spending was primarily for the acquisition and installation of enterprise resource planning erp software and leasehold improvements at our new research and development center 
we anticipate capital expenditures for will be approximately to million including amounts related to our recently acquired fox river paper operation 
spending in includes major projects in neenah germany to add capacity and increase productivity 
capital spending in neenah germany will primarily be financed through locally generated cash flow  government subsidized project financing and a million euro line of credit 
the timing and amount of capital expenditures will depend on the results of engineering studies  the outcome of negotiations with regulatory authorities and the remediation methods ultimately selected 
these capital expenditures are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
in march  we acquired the fox valley corporation  which owns fox river 
we paid million in cash for the acquisition and financed it through a combination of cash and debt drawn against our existing revolving credit facility 
financing commentary our liquidity requirements are being provided by cash generated from operations  proceeds from asset sales and short term and long term borrowings 
availability under our revolving credit facility varies over time depending on the value of our inventory  receivables and various capital assets 
at december   we had million outstanding under our revolving credit facility  outstanding letters of credit of million and million of available credit

the amount of any funds that we may pay or receive and the timing of recognition of the loss to settle the liability for active employees are dependent upon  among other things  an actuarial determination of the value of the obligations being settled  the cost of annuity contracts  regulatory approval to settle the plan and employee elections 
credit agreement amendment in october  we amended our credit agreement to  among other things  i increase availability under our revolver from million to million  ii extend the termination date of the credit agreement to november   iii set the interest rate under the revolver to either a the prime rate as defined in the amended credit agreement plus a percentage ranging from to  or b libor plus a percentage ranging from to  iv reduce the commitment fee pricing on the revolver  and v make other definitional  administrative and covenant modifications to the credit agreement 
in the amendment  the lenders also consented to consummation of our announced purchase of neenah germany 
neenah germany is not expected to become a borrower or guarantor with respect to the revolver 
however  we pledged of our equity interest in neenah germany as security for our obligations under the credit agreement 
our ability to borrow under the revolver is limited by the amendment to the lowest of a million  b our borrowing base as determined in accordance with the amended credit agreement  and c the applicable cap on the amount of credit facilities under the indenture

in march  we entered into the fourth amendment to our credit agreement to  among other things  i increase our secured revolving line of credit from million to million  and ii assist us in consummating the acquisition of fox river for million  and iii make other definitional  administrative and covenant modifications to the credit agreement 
the entities acquired pursuant to the fox river transaction will become guarantors with respect to such secured revolving line of credit 
despite the increase in the total commitment to million  our ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility is limited by the terms of the third amendment to the lowest of a million  b our borrowing base as determined in accordance with the amended credit agreement  and c the applicable cap on the amount of credit facilities under the indenture 
as part of closing the fox river acquisition  we borrowed million in principal under the revolver 
as of such date the total amount outstanding under the revolver was approximately million 
all principal amounts outstanding under the credit agreement are due and fully payable on the date of termination of the credit agreement 
while the fourth amendment increases the total commitment available to us under the credit agreement  no assurance can be given that we will meet the requirements to borrow the full amount available under the credit agreement 
management believes our ability to generate cash from operations and our borrowing capacity are adequate to fund working capital  capital spending and other cash needs for the next twelve months 
our ability to generate adequate cash from operations beyond  however  will depend on  among other things  our ability to successfully implement our business strategies and cost cutting initiatives and to manage the impact of changes in pulp prices and currencies 
we can give no assurance we will be able to successfully implement those strategies and cost cutting initiatives or successfully manage our pulp pricing and currency exposures 
contractual obligations the following table presents the total contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed or determinable as of december  in millions beyond total unconditional purchase obligations long term debt payments interest payments on long term debt other post employment benefit obligations operating leases open purchase orders contributions to pension trusts total contractual obligations the unconditional purchase obligations are for the purchase of raw materials  primarily wood chips 
although we are primarily liable for payments on the above operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations  based on historic operating performance and forecasted future cash flows  we believe our exposure to losses  if any  under these arrangements is not material 
the open purchase orders displayed in the table represent amounts we anticipate will become payable within the next year for goods and services that we have negotiated for delivery 
the above table includes future payments that we will make for post employment benefits other than pensions 
those amounts are estimated using actuarial assumptions  including expected future service  to project the future obligations 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates  and changes in these estimates are recorded when known 
the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments with regard to estimates used 
these critical judgments relate to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
the following summary provides further information about the critical accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with the notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements 
we believe that the consistent application of our policies provides readers of neenah s financial statements with useful and reliable information about our operating results and financial condition 
we have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies with our board of directors and audit committee 
revenue recognition we recognize sales revenue when all of the following have occurred delivery has occurred  persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  pricing is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
delivery is not considered to have occurred until the customer takes title and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership 
the timing of revenue recognition is largely dependent on shipping terms 
revenue is recorded at the time of shipment for terms designated free on board fob shipping point 
for pulp sales to kimberly clark and other customers that are designated fob destination  revenue is recognized when the product is delivered to the customer s delivery site 
sales are reported net of allowable discounts and estimated returns 
reserves for cash discounts  trade allowances and sales returns are estimated using historical experience 
inventories we value us inventories at the lower of cost  using the last in  first out lifo method for financial reporting purposes  or market 
canadian and german inventories are valued at the lower of cost  using either the first in  first out fifo or a weighted average cost method  or market 
the fifo values of total us inventories valued on the lifo method were million and million at december  and  respectively 
cost includes labor  materials and production overhead 
inventories of the canadian pulp operations include both roundwood logs and wood chips 
these inventories are located both at the pulp mills and at various timberlands locations 
in accordance with industry practice  physical inventory counts utilize scaling techniques to estimate quantities of roundwood  as well as various electronic devices to calculate wood chip inventory amounts 
these techniques historically have provided reasonable estimates of such inventories 
deferred income tax assets as of december   we have recorded deferred income tax assets totaling million related to temporary differences  and we have established no valuation allowances against these deferred income tax assets 
as of december   our deferred income tax assets were million 
in determining the need for valuation allowances  we consider many factors  including specific taxing jurisdictions  sources of taxable income  income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction 
a valuation allowance would be recognized if  based on the weight of available evidence  we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
prior to the spin off  our operations were included in the consolidated income tax returns of kimberly clark 
kimberly clark will indemnify us for all income tax liabilities and retain rights to all tax refunds for periods through the date of the spin off 
accordingly  the consolidated balance sheets for periods prior to the spin off do not include current or prior period income tax receivables or payables related to our operations  which were filed on a consolidated basis with kimberly clark 
for all periods  the income tax provisions have been determined as if we were a separate taxpayer 
financial instruments cash and cash equivalents include all cash balances and highly liquid investments with an initial maturity of three months or less 
we place our temporary cash investments with high credit quality financial institutions 
we use derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency and commodity price risks 
we principally use foreign currency forward and pulp future contracts to hedge against these exposures 
derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities and measured at fair market value 
derivative instruments that have been designated as hedges of anticipated future cash flows are marked to market through accumulated other comprehensive income balance sheet adjustments until such time as the related forecasted transactions affect earnings 
derivatives that are not designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value through other income 
fair value estimates are based on relevant market information  including current market rates and prices 
we document relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  and link derivatives designated as cash flow hedges to specific forecasted transactions 
we also assess and document  both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows associated with the hedged items 
any hedge ineffectiveness is charged to expense in the period incurred 
pension benefits in connection with the spin off  and as set forth in the employee matters agreement  obligations for kimberly clark s defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution retirement plans related to active and former employees of the canadian pulp operations and active employees of the us paper operations became our responsibility 
kimberly clark retained the obligations for former employees of the us paper operations 
a share of pension assets related to active employees of the us paper operations were transferred from kimberly clark s pension plan to a new pension plan established by us 
the new plan provides substantially similar benefits and credits our employees for service earned with kimberly clark 
with respect to canadian employees  we assumed the existing pension assets and obligations of the related kimberly clark pension plans 
our funding policy for qualified defined benefit plans is to contribute assets to fully fund the accumulated benefit obligation 
subject to regulatory and tax deductibility limits  any funding shortfall is to be eliminated over a reasonable number of years 
nonqualified plans providing pension benefits in excess of limitations imposed by the taxing authorities are not funded 
consolidated and combined pension expense for defined benefit pension plans was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
pension expense for includes million for settlement and curtailment losses related to the purchase of annuity contracts to settle pension liabilities for current retirees in our ontario  canada defined benefit pension plan 
in addition  in may we recognized a pre tax charge of million for a partial settlement of certain pension obligations related to the closure of the no 
mill 
pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions applied to each of the defined benefit plans 
the weighted average expected long term rate of return on pension fund assets used to calculate pension expense was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the expected long term rate of return on pension fund assets held by our pension trusts was determined based on several factors  including input from pension investment consultants and projected long term returns of broad equity and bond indices 
also considered were the plans historical year and year compounded annual returns 
we anticipate that on average the investment managers for our us and canadian plans will generate annual long term rates of return of at least and  respectively 
our expected long term rate of return on the assets in the plans is based on an asset allocation assumption of about with equity managers  with expected long term rates of return of approximately  and with fixed income managers  with an expected long term rate of return of about 
the actual asset allocation is regularly reviewed and periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
we evaluate our investment strategy and long term rate of return on pension asset assumptions at least annually 
pension expense is estimated based on the fair value of assets rather than a market related value that averages gains and losses over a period of years 
investment gains or losses represent the difference between the expected return calculated using the fair value of the assets and the actual return based on the fair value of assets 
the variance between the actual and the expected gains and losses on pension assets is recognized in pension expense more rapidly than it would be if a market related value for plan assets was used 
as of december   our pension plans had cumulative unrecognized investment losses and other actuarial losses of approximately million 
these unrecognized net losses may increase our future pension expense if not offset by i actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns  ii other factors  including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate our pension obligations or iii other actuarial gains  including whether such accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the corridor determined under sfas  employers accounting for pensions 
the discount or settlement rate that is utilized for determining the present value of future pension obligations in the us is generally based on the yield for a theoretical basket of aa rated corporate bonds currently available in the market place  whose duration matches the timing of expected pension benefit payments 
the discount or settlement rate that is utilized for determining the present value of future pension obligations in canada is generally based on the government of canada long bond rate plus the spread for a long term aa rated bond index over the yield on year us treasury bonds converted to an equivalent one year compound basis 
the weighted average discount rate was and at december  and  respectively 
our consolidated pension expense in is based on an expected weighted average long term rate of return on assets of  a weighted average discount rate of and various other assumptions 
pension expense beyond will depend on future investment performance  our contributions to the pension trusts  changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans 
the fair value of the assets in our defined benefit plans decreased to approximately million at december  from about million at december   primarily due to benefit payments of million including purchases of annuity contracts to settle pension liabilities for current retirees in the ontario  canada defined benefit pension plan  partially offset by investment gains of million and plan contributions of million 
at december   the projected benefit obligations of the defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by approximately million and were marginally lower than the million deficit at december  the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets by approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
contributions to pension trusts in were million compared with million in including million for special termination benefits related to the closure of the no 
mill 
in addition  we made direct benefit payments of approximately million in each of  and for unfunded supplemental retirement benefits 
impairment property  plant and equipment are tested for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such long lived assets may not be recoverable from future net pre tax cash flows 
impairment testing requires significant management judgment including estimating the future success of product lines  future sales volumes  growth rates for selling prices and costs  alternative uses for the assets and estimated proceeds from disposal of the assets 
impairment testing is conducted at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured and are independent of cash flows of other assets 
an asset impairment would be indicated if the sum of the expected future net pre tax cash flows from the use of the asset undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset 
an impairment loss would be measured based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying amount 
we determine fair value based on an expected present value technique in which multiple cash flow scenarios that reflect a range of possible outcomes and a risk free rate of interest are used to estimate fair value 
the estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis are consistent with the business plans and estimates we use to manage our business operations 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset and would increase or decrease the impairment charge 
actual outcomes may differ from the estimates 
see results of operations and related information executive summary results of discontinued operations for a summary of our asset impairment test on the terrace bay pulp facility  which resulted in net pre tax impairment losses of approximately million and million in and  respectively 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill arising from a business combination is recorded as the excess of purchase price and related costs over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in accordance with the guidance of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas 
all of our goodwill was acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of neenah germany in october under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill is subject to impairment testing at least annually 
a fair value based test is applied at the reporting unit level  which is generally one level below the segment level 
the test compares the fair value of an entity s reporting units to the carrying value of those reporting units 
this test requires various judgments and estimates 
the fair value of the reporting unit is determined using an estimate of future cash flows and a risk adjusted discount rate to compute a net present value of future cash flows 
an adjustment to goodwill will be recorded for any goodwill that is determined to be impaired 
impairment of goodwill is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over the fair values of recognized assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
the company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually on november in conjunction with preparation of its annual business plan  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it might be impaired 
goodwill was last tested for impairment as of november  and no impairment was indicated 
intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized on a straight line basis over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships  tradenames and acquired intellectual property 
such intangible assets are being amortized using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of between and years 
certain tradenames are estimated to have indefinite useful lives and as such are not being amortized 
stock based compensation on january   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
stock based compensation cost recognized under sfas r consists of a compensation cost for all unvested stock based grants outstanding as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas and b compensation cost for all stock based awards granted subsequent to adoption based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
the amount of stock based compensation cost recognized is based on the fair value of grants that are ultimately expected to vest and is recognized pro rata over the requisite service period for the entire award 
sfas r amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
 statement of cash flows  to require the reporting of excess tax benefits related to the exercise or vesting of stock based awards as cash provided by financing activities rather than as a reduction in income taxes paid and reported as cash provided by operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a multinational enterprise  we are exposed to risks such as changes in commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and environmental regulation 
a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks  including operating and financing activities and  where deemed appropriate  the use of derivative instruments 
derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation or trading 
credit risk with respect to the counterparties is considered minimal in view of the financial strength of the counterparties 
presented below is a description of our most significant risks 
foreign currency risk our results of operations and cash flows are affected by changes in the canadian dollar exchange rate relative to the us dollar 
in addition  our reported results of operations are affected by changes in the euro exchange rate relative to the us dollar 
exchange rate fluctuations can have a material impact on our financial results because substantially all of our pulp mill s expenses are incurred in canadian dollars and our pulp revenues are denominated in us dollars 
in  a hypothetical increase in the canadian dollar relative to the u 
s dollar would have decreased our income before income taxes by approximately million  excluding additional currency re measurement losses 
we use hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to canadian dollar exchange rate fluctuations  although these arrangements could result in us incurring higher costs than we would incur without the arrangements 
at december  we had foreign currency contracts outstanding in a notional amount of million canadian dollars designated as cash flow hedges of u 
s dollar denominated pulp sales 
the fair value of the contracts was a current asset of million us dollars 
the weighted average exchange rate for the foreign currency contracts at december  was us dollars per canadian dollar and the contracts extend through december currency transactional exposures are also sensitive to changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the canadian dollar and the euro 
we performed a sensitivity test to quantify the effects that possible changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar would have on our pre tax income based on the transactional exposure at december  the effect is calculated by multiplying our net monetary asset or liability position by a change in the exchange rate of the canadian dollar and the euro versus the us dollar 
the results of this sensitivity test are as follows 
as of december   a unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the canadian dollar and the euro involving balance sheet transactional exposure would have resulted in net pre tax losses of approximately million and million  respectively 
finally  the translation of the balance sheets of our canadian operations from canadian dollars into us dollars and our german operations from euros into us dollars also are sensitive to changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the canadian dollar and euro  respectively 
consequently  we performed a sensitivity test to determine if changes in the exchange rate would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of our canadian operations and german operations into us dollars 
these translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments  or uta a component of comprehensive income  within stockholders equity 
the hypothetical change in uta is calculated by multiplying the net assets of our canadian and german operations by a change in the us canadian and us euro exchange rates  respectively 
the results of this sensitivity test are presented in the following paragraph 
as of december   a unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the canadian dollar and the us dollar against the euro would have decreased our stockholders equity by approximately million and million  respectively 
the hypothetical increase in uta is based on the difference between the december  exchange rate and the assumed exchange rate 
commodity risk pulp our results of operations  cash flows and financial position are sensitive to the selling prices of wood pulp 
wood pulp is a commodity for which there are multiple other suppliers 
typically  commodities businesses compete primarily on the basis of price and availability 
the revenues from producing a commodity tend to be cyclical  with periods of shortage and rapidly rising prices leading to increased production and increased industry investment until supply exceeds demand 
those periods are then typically followed by periods of reduced prices and excess and idle capacity until the cycle is repeated 
the markets and profitability of pulp have been  and are likely to continue to be  cyclical 
because our pulp business competes primarily on the basis of price and availability  the financial success of our pulp mills depends on their ability to produce pulp at a competitive cost 
accordingly  we must continuously and effectively manage our cost structure and production capacity to be able to respond effectively to business cycles in the pulp industry 
in the past  we have used hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to pulp price fluctuations  although these arrangements could result in us incurring higher costs than we would incur without the arrangements 
during and  we entered into a series of pulp futures contracts to hedge fluctuations in pulp prices through december at december   we had no outstanding pulp future contracts 
based on shipment volume  a decrease in the market price for northern bleached softwood kraft pulp excluding the impact of volume and other discounts would reduce pretax income of our pulp segment by approximately million 
raw materials we purchase a substantial portion of the raw materials and energy necessary to produce our products on the open market  and  as a result  the price and other terms of those purchases are subject to change based on factors such as worldwide supply and demand and government regulation 
we do not have significant influence over our raw material or energy prices and generally do not possess enough power to pass increases in those prices along to purchasers of our products  unless those increases coincide with increased demand for the product 
therefore  an increase in raw material or energy prices could occur at the same time that prices for our products are decreasing and have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
we obtain a portion of the wood fiber required for the pictou pulp mill from timberland areas licensed by the nova scotia provincial government 
the government has granted us non exclusive licenses for substantial timberland areas from which we obtain fiber  and we also obtain fiber harvested from timberland areas licensed to others by this government 
there can be no assurance that the amount of fiber that we are allowed to harvest from these licensed areas will not be decreased  or that our licenses will continue to be renewed or extended by the governments on acceptable terms 
in the area where our pictou mill is located  there is increasing competition for wood fiber from various other users 
changes in governmental practices and policies as they apply to us and to others from whom we obtain fiber may result in less fiber being available  increased costs to obtain the fiber and additional expense in meeting forestry standards 
these results could have a material adverse effect upon our financial position  liquidity and results of operations 
in  two suppliers provided over of the wood chips used by the pictou mill 
while we believe that alternative sources of critical supplies  such as wood chips  would be available  disruption of our primary sources could create a temporary  adverse effect on product shipments 
also  an interruption in supply of single source specialty grade latex or specialty softwood pulp to our technical products business could disrupt and eventually cause a shutdown of production of certain technical products 
we generate substantially all of the electrical energy used by our munising and pictou mills 
availability of energy is not expected to be a problem in the foreseeable future  but the purchase price of such energy can and likely will fluctuate significantly based on fluctuations in demand and other factors 
in addition  we have forward purchase contracts for natural gas through june at december   we had future contracts for  mmbtus of natural gas with a notional amount of approximately million 
the weighted average price for the natural gas futures contracts at december  was per mmbtu 
in january  we entered into an agreement to purchase thousand pounds per year of green steam to supply energy at our neenah paper mill 
we anticipate that the agreement will substantially reduce the mill s annual consumption of natural gas 
there is no assurance that that we will be able to obtain electricity or natural gas purchases on favorable terms in the future 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on our fixed rate long term debt and our variable rate bank debt 
our objective is to manage the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows from our variable rate debt and on the market value of our fixed rate debt 
at december   we had million of fixed rate long term debt outstanding and million of variable rate borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit agreement 
we are exposed to fluctuations in the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt resulting from changes in market interest rates  but not to fluctuations in our earnings or cash flows 
at december   the fair market value of our fixed rate long term debt was million based upon the quoted market price of the senior notes 
a basis point increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense on variable rate borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit agreement by approximately million 
we could in the future  reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations on our variable rate debt by entering into interest rate hedging arrangements  although those arrangements could result in us incurring higher costs than we would incur without the arrangements 
environmental regulation our manufacturing operations are subject to extensive regulation by us and international authorities 
we have made significant capital expenditures to comply with environmental laws  rules and regulations 
due to changes in environmental laws and regulations  the application of such regulations and changes in environmental control technology  we are not able to predict with certainty the amount of future capital spending to be incurred for environmental purposes 
taking these uncertainties into account  we have planned capital expenditures for environmental projects during the period through of approximately million to million annually 
following the completion of engineering studies and negotiations with local authorities and other interested parties in canada  we do not currently anticipate any material capital expenditures would be required at the pictou mill related to the effluent treatment system  total sulphur emissions or other environmental matters until or later 
we believe these risks can be managed and will not have a material adverse effect on our business or our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
