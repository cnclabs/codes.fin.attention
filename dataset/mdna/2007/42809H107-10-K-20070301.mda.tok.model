table of contents accounting policies critical accounting policies and estimates accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities on the corporation s balance sheet and revenues and expenses on the income statement 
the accounting methods used can affect net income  stockholders equity and various financial statement ratios 
however  the corporation s accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity 
accounting for exploration and development costs exploration and production activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method 
costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage  including lease bonuses  brokers fees and other related costs  are capitalized 
annual lease rentals  exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred 
costs of drilling and equipping productive wells  including development dry holes  and related production facilities are capitalized 
the costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found 
exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project 
if either of those criteria is not met  or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project  the capitalized well costs are charged to expense 
indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include commitment of project personnel  active negotiations for sales contracts with customers  negotiations with governments  operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors 
crude oil and natural gas reserves the determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities 
the estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations  the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment  as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill 
the corporation s oil and gas reserves are calculated in accordance with sec regulations and interpretations and the requirements of the financial accounting standards board 
for reserves to be booked as proved they must be commercially producible  government and project operator approvals must be obtained and depending on the amount of the project cost  senior management or the board of directors  must commit to fund the project 
the corporation s oil and gas reserve estimation and reporting process involves an annual independent third party reserve determination as well as internal technical appraisals of reserves 
the corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties 
the corporation s technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells  performance reviews  new technical data and other studies 
to provide consistency throughout the corporation  standard reserve estimation guidelines  definitions  reporting reviews and approval practices are used 
the internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management reviews the estimates 
the oil and gas reserve estimates reported in the supplementary oil and gas data in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
disclosures about oil and gas producing activities fas no 
are determined independently by the consulting firm of degolyer and macnaughton d m and are consistent with internal estimates 
annually  the corporation provides d m with engineering  geological and geophysical data  actual production histories and other information necessary for the reserve determination 
the corporation s and d m s technical staffs meet to review and discuss the information provided 
senior management and the board of directors review the final reserve estimates issued by d m 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill as explained below there are significant differences in the way long lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing 
the corporation reviews long lived assets  including oil and gas fields  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered 
long lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows the field level for oil and gas assets and are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
if the carrying amounts of the long lived assets are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash flow 
table of contents estimates  the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded 
the amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows 
in the case of oil and gas fields  the present value of future net cash flows is based on management s best estimate of future prices  which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices  applied to projected production volumes of individual fields and discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks involved 
the projected production volumes represent reserves  including probable reserves  expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures 
the production volumes  prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information 
oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows  since the standardized measure requires the use of actual prices on the last day of the year 
the corporation s impairment tests of long lived exploration and production producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes including recovery factors  selling prices  operating and capital costs and the timing of future production  which are updated each time an impairment test is performed 
the corporation could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields were reduced 
significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas selling prices could also result in asset impairments 
in accordance with fas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets fas no 
 the corporation s goodwill is not amortized  but is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter at a reporting unit level 
the reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed 
the corporation s goodwill is assigned to the exploration and production operating segment and it expects that the benefits of goodwill will be recovered through the operation of that segment 
the corporation s fair value estimate of the exploration and production segment is the sum of the discounted anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known developments  the estimated risk adjusted present value of exploration assets  and an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost savings  access to new business opportunities  enterprise control  improved processes and increased market share 
the corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar exploration and production companies 
the determination of the fair value of the exploration and production operating segment depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves  future prices  timing of future net cash flows and market premiums 
significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of the exploration and production operating segment that could result in an impairment of goodwill 
because there are significant differences in the way long lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing  there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned to the exploration and production segment 
segments the corporation has two operating segments  exploration and production and marketing and refining

derivatives the corporation utilizes derivative instruments for both non trading and trading activities 
in non trading activities  the corporation uses futures  forwards  options and swaps  individually or in combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil  natural gas  refined products and electricity  and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in trading activities  the corporation  principally through a consolidated 
table of contents partnership  trades energy commodities derivatives  including futures  forwards  options and swaps  based on expectations of future market conditions 
all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the corporation s balance sheet 
the corporation s policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative 
the changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges under fas no 
are recognized currently in earnings 
derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions cash flow hedges or hedges of firm commitments fair value hedges 
the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings 
changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings 
the change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings 
derivatives that are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges are tested for effectiveness prospectively before they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on an on going basis to determine whether they continue to qualify for hedge accounting 
the prospective and retrospective effectiveness calculations are performed using either historical simulation or other statistical models  which utilize historical observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot prices 
income taxes judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
the corporation has net operating loss carryforwards in several jurisdictions  including the united states  and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses 
additionally  the corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities 
regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized 
if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized 
in evaluating realizability of deferred tax assets  the corporation refers to the reversal periods for temporary differences  available carryforward periods for net operating losses  estimates of future taxable income  the availability of tax planning strategies  the existence of appreciated assets and other factors 
estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the corporation s internal business forecasts

effective january  environment  health and safety the corporation has implemented a values based  socially responsible strategy focused on improving environment  health and safety performance and making a positive impact on communities 
the strategy is supported by the corporation s environment  health  safety and social responsibility ehs sr policies and by environment and safety management systems that help protect the corporation s workforce  customers and local communities 
the corporation s management systems are designed to uphold or exceed international standards and are intended to promote internal consistency  adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in ehs sr performance 
improved performance may  in the short term  increase the corporation s operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to assets  reputation and license to operate

the corporation has programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance  audit facilities  train employees and to generally meet corporate ehs sr goals 
the production of motor and other fuels in the united states and elsewhere has faced increasing regulatory pressures in recent years 
in  new regulations went into effect that have already significantly reduced gasoline sulfur content and additional regulations to reduce the allowable sulfur content in diesel fuel went into effect in additional reductions in gasoline and fuel oil sulfur content are under consideration 
fuels production will likely continue to be subject to more stringent regulation in future years and as such may require additional capital expenditures 
capital expenditures necessary to comply with low sulfur gasoline requirements at port reading were million  of which million was spent in and the remainder was spent in capital expenditures to comply with low sulfur gasoline and diesel fuel requirements at hovensa are presently expected to be approximately million in total  million of which has already been spent and the remainder is expected to be spent in hovensa has and continues to plan to finance these capital expenditures through cash flow from operations 
the energy policy act of eliminated the clean air act s mandatory oxygen content requirement for reformulated gasoline and imposes on refiners a requirement to use specific quantities of renewable content in gasoline 
many states have also enacted bans on the use of mtbe in gasoline  many of which will take effect between and as a result  several companies have announced their intention to cease using mtbe  since it will no longer be needed in reformulated gasoline to comply with the clean air act and does not meet the new renewable content requirement 
in response to these changes in the gasoline marketplace  the corporation and hovensa phased out the use of ether based oxygenates during both companies are reviewing the most cost effective means to replace ether unit processing capabilities  which may necessitate additional capital investments 

table of contents as described in item legal proceedings  in the corporation and hovensa began discussions with the us epa regarding the epa s petroleum refining initiative pri 
the pri is an ongoing program that is designed to reduce certain air emissions at all us refineries 
since  the epa has entered into settlements addressing these emissions with petroleum refining companies that control over of the domestic refining capacity 
negotiations with the epa are continuing and depending on the outcome of these discussions  the corporation and hovensa may experience increased capital expenditures and operating expenses related to air emissions controls 
settlements with other refiners allow for controls to be phased in over several years 
hovensa is constructing a new wastewater treatment system at the refinery 
this project will significantly enhance the refinery s ability to treat wastewater and better protect the marine environment of st 
croix 
the cost to complete the project is approximately million  of which million has already been incurred 
the corporation has undertaken a program to assess  monitor and reduce the emission of greenhouse gases  including carbon dioxide and methane 
the challenges associated with this program are significant  not only from the standpoint of technical feasibility  but also from the perspective of adequately measuring the corporation s greenhouse gas inventory 
the corporation has completed a revised monitoring protocol which will allow for better measurement of greenhouse gases and is conducting an independently verified audit of its emissions 
once completed  the monitoring protocol will allow for better control of these emissions and assist the corporation in complying with any future regulatory restrictions 
the corporation expects continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation related primarily to existing conditions 
sites where corrective action may be necessary include gasoline stations  terminals  onshore exploration and production facilities  refineries including solid waste management units under permits issued pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act and  although not currently significant  superfund sites where the corporation has been named a potentially responsible party 
the corporation accrues for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable 
at year end  the corporation s reserve for its estimated environmental liability was approximately million 
the corporation expects that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites 
the corporation s remediation spending was million in and and million in capital expenditures for facilities  primarily to comply with federal  state and local environmental standards  other than for low sulfur projects discussed above  were million in  million in and million in forward looking information certain sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  including references to the corporation s future results of operations and financial position  liquidity and capital resources  capital expenditures  oil and gas production  tax rates  debt repayment  hedging  derivative  market risk and environmental disclosures  off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations and contingencies include forward looking information
