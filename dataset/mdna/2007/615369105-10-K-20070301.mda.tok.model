this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements 
see forward looking statements commencing on page and item a 
risk factors commencing on page for a discussion of uncertainties  risks and other factors associated with these statements 
the company except where otherwise indicated  the terms moody s and the company refer to moody s corporation and its subsidiaries 
moody s is a provider of i credit ratings  research and analysis covering fixed income securities  other debt instruments and the entities that issue such instruments in the global capital markets  and credit training services  and ii quantitative credit risk assessment products and services and credit processing software for banks  corporations and investors in credit sensitive assets

it also publishes investor oriented credit information  research and economic commentary  including in depth research on major debt issuers  industry studies  special comments and credit opinion handbooks 
the moody s kmv business develops and distributes quantitative credit risk assessment products and services and credit processing software for banks  corporations and investors in credit sensitive assets 
the company operated as part of the dun bradstreet corporation old d b until september  the distribution date  when old d b separated into two publicly traded companies moody s corporation and the new d b corporation new d b 
at that time  old d b distributed to its shareholders shares of new d b stock 
new d b comprised the business of old d b s dun bradstreet operating company the d b business 
the remaining business of old d b consisted solely of the business of providing ratings and related research and credit risk management services the moody s business and was renamed moody s corporation 
the method by which old d b distributed to its shareholders its shares of new d b stock is hereinafter referred to as the distribution 
critical accounting estimates moody s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires moody s to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  moody s evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable allowances  contingencies  goodwill and intangible assets  pension and other post retirement benefits and stock based compensation 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management s judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
revenue recognition in recognizing revenue related to ratings  moody s uses judgments to allocate billed revenue between ratings and the future monitoring of ratings in cases where the company does not charge ongoing monitoring fees for a particular issuer 
these judgments are not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties  but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods 
in such cases  the company defers portions of rating fees that it estimates will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated monitoring periods 
the portion of the revenue to be deferred is based upon a number of factors  including the estimated fair market value of the monitoring services charged for similar securities or issuers 
the estimated monitoring period over which the deferred revenue will be recognized is determined based on factors such as the estimated lives of the rated securities 
currently  the estimated monitoring periods range from one year to ten years 
at december   and  deferred revenue included approximately million  million and million  respectively  related to such deferred monitoring fees 
additionally  in the case of commercial mortgage backed securities  issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront 
these fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring period which is determined based on the lives of the rated securities 
currently  the monitoring periods range from five to years 
at december   and  deferred revenue related to commercial mortgage backed securities was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
moody s estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which  in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee  issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding 
related revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed subsequently when actual data is available 
the estimate is determined based on the issuers most recent reported quarterly data 
at december   and  accounts receivable included approximately million  million and million  respectively  related to accrued commercial paper revenue 
historically  the company has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings 
accounts receivable allowance moody s records as reductions of revenue provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings based on historical experience and current conditions 
such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance 
adjustments to and write offs of accounts receivable are charged against the allowance 
moody s evaluates its accounts receivable by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current status of customer accounts 
moody s also considers the economic environment of the customers  both from an industry and geographic perspective  in evaluating the need for allowances 
based on its reviews  moody s establishes or adjusts allowances  as considered appropriate 
this process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts 
accordingly  moody s results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance 
management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and write offs under current conditions 
however  significant changes in any of the above noted factors  or actual write offs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts could result in revenue adjustments that are greater or less than moody s estimates 
in each of  and  the company adjusted its provision rates and its allowances to reflect its current estimate of the appropriate level of accounts receivable allowance 
contingencies accounting for contingencies  including those matters described in the contingencies section of this management s discussion and analysis  commencing on page is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome 
in many cases  the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties  including governmental or judicial bodies 
the provisions made in the consolidated financial statements  as well as the related disclosures  represent management s best estimates of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate 
the company regularly reviews contingencies and as additional information becomes available may  in the future  adjust the provisions made in respect thereof 
since the potential exposure on many of these matters is material  and it is possible that these matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the company has reserved  their resolution could have a material adverse effect on moody s future reported results and financial position 
in addition  potential cash outlays related to the resolution of these exposures could be material 
for the years ended december   and  the provision for income taxes reflected credits of million  million and charges of million  respectively  due to changes in the company s reserves for legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by moody s in connection with its separation from old d b in october these tax matters are discussed under legacy tax matters below 
goodwill and other intangible assets moody s evaluates its goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill requires that the company make important assumptions and judgments about future operating results and cash flows as well as terminal values and discount rates 
in estimating future operating results and cash flows  moody s considers internal budgets and strategic plans  expected long term growth rates  and the effects of external factors and market conditions 
if actual future operating results and cash flows or external conditions differ from the company s judgments  or if changes in assumed terminal values or discount rates are made  an impairment charge may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of goodwill  which charge could be material to the company s financial position and results of operations 
amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
pension and other post retirement benefits the expenses  assets  liabilities and obligations that moody s reports for pension and other post retirement benefits are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances 
these assumptions include the following future compensation increases  based on the company s long term actual experience and future outlook long term return on pension plan assets  based on historical portfolio results and the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plan s portfolio which is principally comprised of equity and fixed income investments future healthcare cost trends  based on historical market data  near term outlooks and assessments of likely long term trends discount rates  based on current yields on high grade corporate long term bonds the discount rate selected to measure the present value of the company s benefit obligations as of december  was derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the company compares the plans projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the citibank pension discount curve 
the cash flows are then discounted to their present value and an overall discount rate is determined 
moody s major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in determining these assumptions  the company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate 
while the company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses  assets and liabilities related to the company s pension and other post retirement benefits 
when actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used  actuarial gains or losses arise 
to the extent the total outstanding gain or loss exceeds a corridor threshold as defined in sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas no 
 the excess is subject to amortization in annual expense over the estimated average future working lifetime of active plan participants 
for moody s pension and other post retirement benefit plans  the total losses as of december  which have not been recognized in annual expense are million and moody s expects to recognize million of actuarial losses in annual net periodic benefit expense 
for moody s funded pension plan  the differences between the expected long term rate of return assumption and actual experience could also affect the net periodic pension expense 
as permitted under sfas no 
 the company spreads the impact of asset experience over a five year period for purposes of calculating the market related value of assets which is used in determining the expected return on assets component of annual expense and in calculating the total unrecognized gain or loss subject to amortization 
as of december   the company has an unrecognized asset gain of million  of which million will be recognized in the market related value of assets which is used to calculate the expected return on assets component in expense 
the table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage point decrease in each of these assumptions will have on moody s operating income dollars in millions 
these effects have been calculated using the company s current projections of assets  liabilities  obligations and expenses related to pension and other post retirement plans  which could change as updated data becomes available 
assumption used for estimated impact on operating income decrease increase discount rate weighted average assumed compensation growth rate assumed long term rate of return on pension assets discount rates of and are used for pension plans and other post retirement plans  respectively 
a one percentage point increase in assumed healthcare cost trend rates will not affect projected expenses 
based on current projections  the company estimates that expenses related to pension and post retirement plans will be approximately million in compared with million in the expected expense decrease in reflects the effects of higher discount rates  higher plan asset gains and lower amortization of actuarial losses  which are partially offset by normal growth in plan liabilities 
stock based compensation on january   the company adopted  under the modified prospective application method  the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised share based payment sfas no 
r 
under this pronouncement  companies are required to record compensation expense for all share based payment award transactions granted to employees based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant 
this includes shares issued under employee stock purchase plans  stock options  restricted stock and stock appreciation rights 
previously  on january   the company adopted  on a prospective basis  the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model that uses assumptions and estimates that the company believes are reasonable 
some of the assumptions and estimates  such as share price volatility and expected option holding period  are based in part on moody s experience during the period since becoming a public company  which is limited 
the use of different assumptions and estimates in the black scholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense 
an increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on operating income in dollars in millions assumption used increase in assumption estimated impact on operating income in increase decrease average expected dividend yield grants average expected share price volatility grants expected option holding period grants years year other estimates in addition  there are other accounting estimates within moody s consolidated financial statements  including recoverability of deferred tax assets  anticipated dividend distributions from non us subsidiaries and valuation of investments in affiliates 
management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in moody s consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in moody s consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on moody s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on key accounting policies that impact moody s

moody s discloses material pending legal proceedings  other than routine litigation incidental to moody s business  material proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities and other pending matters that it may determine to be appropriate 
for those matters where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated  the company has recorded liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as appropriate 
in other instances  because of uncertainties related to the probable outcome and or the amount or range of loss  management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if significant 
as additional information becomes available  the company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such liabilities accordingly 
based on its review of the latest information available  in the opinion of management  the ultimate liability of the company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings  claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on moody s financial position  results of operations or cash flows  subject to the contingencies described below 
legacy contingencies moody s has exposure to certain potential liabilities assumed in connection with the distribution 
these contingencies are referred to by moody s as legacy contingencies 
the principal legacy contingencies presently outstanding relate to tax matters 
to understand the company s exposure to the potential liabilities described below  it is important to understand the relationship between moody s and new d b  and the relationship among new d b and its predecessors and other parties who  through various corporate reorganizations and related contractual commitments  have assumed varying degrees of responsibility with respect to such matters 
in november  the dun bradstreet corporation through a spin off separated into three separate public companies the dun bradstreet corporation  acnielsen corporation acnielsen and cognizant corporation cognizant 
in june  the dun bradstreet corporation through a spin off separated into two separate public companies the dun bradstreet corporation and rh donnelley corporation 
during  cognizant through a spin off separated into two separate public companies ims health incorporated ims health and nielsen media research  inc nmr 
in september  old d b through a spin off separated into two separate public companies new d b and moody s  as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
legacy tax matters old d b and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business  including through tax free restructurings of both their foreign and domestic operations 
these initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities 
pursuant to a series of agreements  as between themselves  ims health and nmr are jointly and severally liable to pay one half  and new d b and moody s are jointly and severally liable to pay the other half  of any payments for taxes  penalties and accrued interest resulting from unfavorable internal revenue service irs rulings on certain tax matters as described in such agreements excluding the matter described below as amortization expense deductions for which new d b and moody s are solely responsible and certain other potential tax liabilities  also as described in such agreements 
in connection with the distribution and pursuant to the terms of the distribution agreement  new d b and moody s have  between themselves  agreed to be financially responsible for any potential liabilities that may arise to the extent such potential liabilities are not directly attributable to their respective business operations 
without limiting the generality of the foregoing  three specific tax matters are discussed below 
royalty expense deductions this matter related to the irs s stated intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by old d b on its tax returns for the years through as well as the irs s intention to reallocate to old d b income and expense items that had been reported in a certain partnership tax return for these matters were settled with the irs in a closing agreement executed in the third quarter of and accordingly  the company reduced its reserve for this matter by million 
however  ims health and nmr disagreed with new d b s calculation of each party s share of the liability 
new d b may commence arbitration proceedings against ims health and nmr to collect the million that new d b and moody s each were obligated to pay to the irs on their behalf 
based upon the current understanding of the positions that new d b and ims health may take  the company believes it is likely that new d b will prevail  but moody s cannot predict with certainty the outcome 
in the second quarter of  moody s paid approximately million for the state income tax liability connected with the terms of the october settlement with the irs and reversed the remaining reserve of million 
additionally  the irs reasserted its position that certain tax refund claims made by old d b related to and may be offset by tax liabilities relating to the above mentioned partnership formed in in the fourth quarter of  new d b filed a protest with the irs appeals office concerning the irs s denial of the tax refunds 
in the third quarter of  the irs appeals office rejected new d b s protest 
new d b is determining whether to file suit for the refund 
moody s share is estimated at approximately million 
amortization expense deductions in april  new d b received examination reports the april examination reports from the irs with respect to a partnership transaction entered into in which resulted in amortization expense deductions on the tax returns of old d b since these deductions could continue through in the april examination reports  the irs stated its intention to disallow the amortization expense deductions related to this partnership that were claimed by old d b on its and tax returns 
the irs also stated its intention to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by old d b on its and tax returns with respect to the partnership transaction 
in addition  the irs stated its intention to disregard the partnership structure and to reallocate to old d b certain partnership income and expense items that had been reported in the partnership tax returns for and new d b disagrees with these positions taken by the irs 
irs audits of old d b s or new d b s tax returns for years subsequent to have resulted in the issuance of similar examination reports for the through tax years 
similar examination reports could result for tax years subsequent to should any such payments be made by new d b related to either the april examination reports or any potential examination reports for future years  including years subsequent to the separation of moody s from new d b  then pursuant to the terms of the distribution agreement  moody s would have to pay to new d b its share 
in addition  should new d b discontinue claiming the amortization expense deductions on future tax returns  moody s would be required  pursuant to the terms of the distribution agreement  to repay to new d b an amount equal to the discounted value of its share of the related future tax benefits 
new d b had paid the discounted value of of the future tax benefits from this transaction in cash to moody s at the distribution date 
moody s estimates that the company s potential exposures including penalties and interest  and net of tax benefits could be up to million relating to the disallowance of amortization expense deductions and could increase by approximately million to million per year  depending on actions that the irs may take and on whether new d b continues claiming the amortization expense deductions on its tax returns 
additionally  there are potential exposures that could be up to million relating to the reallocation of the partnership income and expense to old d b 
moody s also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability 
new d b is currently in discussion with the irs on these issues 
on march   new d b and moody s each deposited million with the irs in order to stop the accrual of statutory interest on potential tax deficiencies up to or equal to that amount with respect to the through tax years 
moody s believes that the irs s proposed assessments of tax against old d b and the proposed reallocations of partnership income and expense to old d b are inconsistent with each other 
accordingly  while it is possible that the irs could ultimately prevail in whole or in part on one of such positions  moody s believes that it is unlikely that the irs will prevail on both 
utilization of capital losses in december  new d b executed a formal settlement agreement for all outstanding issues related to the matter concerning utilization of certain capital losses generated by old d b during and new d b received two assessments on this matter during the first quarter of the third and final assessment was received in april of which moody s paid million 
the amounts paid by moody s for the first two assessments included its share of approximately million that moody s and new d b believe should have been paid by ims health and nmr  but were not paid by them due to their disagreement with various aspects of new d b s calculation of their respective shares of the payments 
new d b was unable to resolve this dispute with ims health and nmr  and has commenced arbitration proceedings against them 
moody s believes that new d b should prevail in its position  but the company cannot predict with certainty the outcome 
in the first quarter of  moody s had increased its liabilities by million due to this disagreement 
summary of moody s exposure to legacy tax related matters the company considers from time to time the range and probability of potential outcomes related to its legacy tax matters and establishes liabilities that it believes are appropriate in light of the relevant facts and circumstances 
in doing so  moody s makes estimates and judgments as to future events and conditions and evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
for the years ended december   and  the company recorded million and million net reversals of reserves and increased reserves by million  respectively 
the company also has recorded million  million and million of net interest expense related to its legacy tax matters in the years ended december   and  respectively 
moody s total recorded net legacy tax related liabilities as of december  were million and are classified as long term 
it is possible that the legacy tax matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the liabilities recorded by the company  which could result in additional charges that may be material to moody s future reported results  financial position and cash flows 
in matters where moody s believes the irs has taken inconsistent positions  moody s may be obligated initially to pay its share of related duplicative assessments 
however  moody s believes that ultimately it is unlikely that the irs would retain such duplicative payments 
dividends during  the company paid a quarterly dividend of per share in each of the quarters of moody s common stock  resulting in dividends paid per share of during the year 
during  the company paid a quarterly dividend of in the first quarter and in each of the three subsequent quarters  per share of moody s common stock  resulting in dividends paid per share of during the year
