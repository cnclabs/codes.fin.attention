item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
our consolidated financial statements are not directly comparable from period to period because of our acquisition and disposition of selected assets of radio stations and our acquisition of selected assets of non broadcast businesses 
see note to our consolidated financial statements under item for additional information 
overview as a radio broadcasting company with a national radio network  we derive our revenue primarily from the sale of broadcast time and radio advertising on a national and local basis 
historically  our principal sources of revenue have been the sale of block program time  both to national and local program producers  the sale of advertising time on our radio stations  both to national and local advertisers  and the sale of advertising time on our national radio network 
the rates we are able to charge for broadcast time and advertising time are dependent upon several factors  including audience share  how well our stations perform for our clients  the size of the market  the general economic conditions in each market  and supply and demand on both a local and national level 
our sources of revenue and product offerings also increasingly include non broadcast businesses  including our internet and publishing businesses 
the following table shows the percentage of net broadcasting revenue for each broadcasting revenue source 
year ended december  dollars in thousands block program time national local advertising national local infomercials network other net broadcasting revenue our broadcasting revenue is affected primarily by the program rates our radio stations charge  the level of broadcast air time sold  and by the advertising rates our radio stations and networks charge 
the rates for block programming time are based upon our stations ability to attract audiences that will support the program producers through contributions and purchases of their products 
advertising rates are based upon the demand for advertising time  which in turn is based on our stations and networks ability to produce results for their advertisers 
we do not subscribe to traditional audience measuring services for our christian teaching and talk stations 
instead  we have marketed ourselves to advertisers based upon the responsiveness of our audiences 
in selected markets we subscribe to arbitron  which develops quarterly reports to measure a radio station s audience share in the demographic groups t argeted by advertisers 
each of our radio stations and our networks has a pre determined level of time that they make available for block programming and or advertising  which may vary at different times of the day 
as is typical in the radio broadcasting industry  our second and fourth quarter advertising revenue generally exceeds our first and third quarter advertising revenue 
this seasonal fluctuation in advertising revenue corresponds with quarterly fluctuations in the retail advertising industry 
quarterly revenue from the sale of block programming time does not tend to vary significantly  however  because program rates are generally set annually and are recognized on a per program basis 
our cash flow is affected by a transitional period experienced by radio stations when  due to the nature of the radio station  our plans for the market and other circumstances  we find it beneficial to change its format 
this transitional period is when we develop a radio station s listener and customer base 
during this period  a station may generate negative or insignificant cash flow 
in the broadcasting industry  radio stations often utilize trade or barter agreements to exchange advertising time for goods or services such as non broadcast advertising  travel or lodging in lieu of cash 
in order to preserve the sale of our advertising time for cash  we generally enter into trade agreements only if the goods or services bartered to us will be used in our business 
we have minimized our use of trade agreements and have generally sold most of our advertising time for cash 
in  we sold of our advertising time for cash 
in addition  it is our general policy not to preempt advertising paid for in cash with advertising paid for in trade 
the primary operating expenses incurred in the ownership and operation of our radio stations include i employee salaries  commissions and related employee benefits and taxes  ii facility expenses such as rent and utilities  iii marketing and promotional expenses and iv music license fees 
in addition to these expenses  our network incurs programming costs and lease expenses for satellite communication facilities 
we also incur and will continue to incur significant depreciation  amortization and interest expense as a result of completed and future acquisitions of radio stations and existing and future borrowings 
salem web network and towhanll 
com  our internet businesses  earn revenues from the sales of streaming services  sales of advertising and  to a lesser extent  sales of software and software support contracts 
salem publishing  our publishing business  earns its revenue by selling advertising in and subscriptions to its publications and by selling books 
xulon press earns its revenue from the publishing of books 
the revenue and related operating expenses of these businesses are reported as non broadcast on our consolidated statement of operations 
same station definition in the discussion of our results of operations below  we compare our results between periods on an as reported basis that is  the results of operations of all radio stations and network formats owned or operated at any time during either period and on a same station basis 
with regard to fiscal quarters  we include in our same station comparisons the results of operations of radio stations or radio station clusters and networks that we own or operate in the same format during the quarter  as well as the corresponding quarter of the prior year 
same station results for a full year are based on the sum of the same station results for the four quarters of that year

non gaap financial measures the performance of a radio broadcasting company is customarily measured by the ability of its stations to generate station operating income 
we define station operating income soi as net broadcasting revenue less broadcasting operating expenses 
accordingly  changes in net broadcasting revenue and broadcasting operating expenses  as explained above  have a direct impact on changes in soi 
soi is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with gaap  as a result it should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for our results of operations presented on the basis of gaap 
management believes that soi is a useful non gaap financial measure to investors  when considered in conjunction with operating income  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure  because it is generally recognized by the radio broadcasting industry as a tool in measuring performance and in applying valuation methodologies for companies in the media  entertainment and communications industries 
this measure is used by investors and analysts who report on the industry to provide comparisons between broadcasting groups 
additionally  our management uses soi as one of the key measures of operating efficiency and profitability 
soi does not purport to represent cash provided by operating activities 
our statement of cas h flows presents our cash flow activity and our income statement presents our historical performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
soi as defined by and used by our company is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies

the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts  acquisitions and upgrades of radio station and network assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  and long term debt and debt covenant compliance 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates are critical accounting policies which affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
accounting for acquisitions and upgrades of radio station and network assets a majority of our radio station acquisitions are acquisitions of selected assets and not acquisitions of businesses 
such asset acquisitions have consisted primarily of the fcc licenses to broadcast in a particular market 
we often do not acquire the existing format  or we change the format upon acquisition when we find it beneficial 
as a result  a substantial portion of the purchase price for the assets of a radio station is allocated to the fcc license 
it is our policy generally to retain third party appraisers to value radio stations  networks or non broadcast properties 
the allocations assigned to acquired fcc licenses and other assets are subjective by their nature and require our careful consideration and judgment 
we believe the allocations represent appropriate estimates of the fair value of the assets acquired 
as part of the valuation and appraisal process  the third party appraisers prepare reports which assign v alues to the various asset categories in our financial statements 
our management reviews these reports and determines the reasonableness of the assigned values used to record the acquisition of the radio station  network or non broadcast properties at the close of the transaction 
we undertake projects from time to time to upgrade our radio station technical facilities and or fcc licenses 
our policy is to capitalize costs incurred up to the point where the project is complete  at which time we transfer the costs to the appropriate fixed asset and or intangible asset categories 
when the completion of a project is contingent upon fcc or other regulatory approval  we assess the probable future benefit of the asset at the time that it is recorded and monitor it through the fcc or other regulatory approval process 
in the event the required approval is not considered probable  we write off the capitalized costs of the project 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
an analysis is performed by applying various percentages based on the age of the receivable and other subjective and historical analysis 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the likelihood of ultimate realization of these receivables including the current creditworthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
intangible assets under the financial accounting standards board s rules  sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we no longer amortize goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives  but perform annual impairment tests in accordance with these statements 
we believe our fcc licenses have indefinite lives and accordingly amortization expense is no longer recorded for our fcc licenses as well as our goodwill 
other intangible assets continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
we perform impairment tests on our fcc licenses and goodwill at least annually 
the annual tests are performed during the fourth quarter of each year and include comparing the recorded values to the appraised values  calculations of discounted cash flows  operating income and other analyses 
as of december   no impairment was recognized 
the assessment of the fair values of these assets and the underlying businesses are estimates  which require careful consideration and judgments by our management 
if conditions in the markets in which our stations and non broadcast businesses operate or if the operating results of our stations and non broadcast businesses change or fail to develop as anticipated  our estimates of the fair values may change in the future and may result in impairment charges 
valuation allowance deferred taxes for financial reporting purposes  the company has recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   to offset a portion of the deferred tax assets related to the state net operating loss carryforwards 
management regularly reviews our financial forecasts in an effort to determine our ability to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes 
accordingly  the valuation allowance is adjusted periodically based on management s estimate of the benefit the company will receive from such carryforwards 
long term debt and debt covenant compliance our classification of borrowings under our credit facilities as long term debt on our balance sheet is based on our assessment that  under the borrowing restrictions and covenants in our credit facilities and after considering our projected operating results and cash flows for the coming year  no principal payments  other than the scheduled principal reductions in our term loan facility  will be required pursuant to the credit agreement 
these projections are estimates dependent upon a number of factors including developments in the markets in which we are operating in and economic and political factors  among other factors 
accordingly  these projections are inherently uncertain and our actual results could differ from these estimates 
should our actual results differ materially from these estimates  payments may become due under our credit facilities or it may become necessary to seek an amendment to our credit facilities 
b ased on our management s current assessment  we do not anticipate principal payments becoming due under our credit facilities  or a further amendment of our credit facilities becoming necessary 
stock based compensation the company has one stock option plan  the amended and restated stock incentive plan  the plan under which stock options and restricted stock units are granted to employees  directors  officers and advisors of the company 
as of december   a maximum of  shares are authorized under the plan  of which  are outstanding and  are exercisable 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r  which requires the measurement at fair value and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards 
total stock based compensation expense during was million 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under stock purchase plans at the date of grant requires judgment 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of these share based awards consistent with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
option pricing models  including the black scholes model  also require the use of input assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  expected dividend rate  and expected risk free rate of return 
the assumptions for expected volatility and expected life are the two assumptions that significantly affect the grant date fair value 
the expected dividend rate and expected ri sk free rate of return are not currently significant to the calculation of fair value

this statement was effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year and had a significant impact on our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
as a result of this accounting pronouncement  we recognized a net gain on exchanges of radio stations of million for the year ended december   which is reported in discontinued operations and in gain loss on disposal of assets

liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed acquisitions through borrowings  including borrowings under credit facilities and  to a lesser extent  from operating cash flow and selected asset dispositions 
we expect to fund future acquisitions from cash on hand  proceeds from our debt and equity offerings  borrowings under the credit facilities  operating cash flow and possibly through the sale of income producing assets 
we have historically funded  and will continue to fund  expenditures for operations  administrative expenses  capital expenditures and debt service required by our credit facilities and our senior subordinated notes from operating cash flow  borrowings under our credit facilities and  if necessary  proceeds from the sale of selected assets 
we believe that cash on hand  cash flow from operations  and borrowings under the credit facilities will be sufficient to permit us to meet our financial obligations  fund pending acquis itions and fund operations for at least the next twelve months 
cash

net cash provided by operating activities decreased by million to million for the year ended december  compared to million in the decrease is primarily due to higher cash paid for interest expense of million that was offset by an increase in net income from continuing operations of million that includes non cash gains recognized on exchanges of radio stations of million and non cash stock based compensation expense of million that were partially offset by an increase in deferred income taxes of million and a decrease in deferred revenue of million 
net cash used by investing activities decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million in the decrease is primarily due to lower cash outlays for acquisition activity  million of cash used to purchase selected assets of five radio stations  three internet businesses and two magazine businesses during the twelve months ended december   compared to million used to purchase selected assets of seven radio stations and one internet business in the prior year 
net cash from financing activities decreased million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to cash used for the redemption of our notes of million which included a premium  the payment of a special cash dividend of million  and treasury stock repurchases of million offset by net borrowings of million

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative instruments we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
salem actively monitors these fluctuations and uses derivative instruments from time to time to manage the related risk 
in accordance with our risk management strategy  salem uses derivative instruments only for the purpose of managing risk associated with an asset  liability  committed transaction  or probable forecasted transaction that is identified by management 
our use of derivative instruments may result in short term gains or losses and may increase volatility in salem s earnings 
under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument at each new measurement date is dependent upon its intended use 
the change in the fair value of a derivative instrument designated as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or a firm commitment  referred to as a fair value hedge  is recognized as gain or loss in earnings in the period of the change together with an offsetting gain or loss for the change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged 
the change in the fair value of a derivative instrument designated as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows of recognized assets  liabilities or of unrecognized forecasted transactions  referred to as a cash flow hedge  is recognized as other comprehensive income 
the differential paid or received on the interest rate swaps is recognized in earnings as an adjustment to interest expense

at december  a hypothetical basis point increase in the prime rate or libor  as applicable  would result in additional interest expense of million on an annualized basis 
in addition to the variable rate debt disclosed above  we have fixed rate debt with a carrying value of million relating to the outstanding notes as of december   with an aggregate fair value of million 
we are exposed to changes in the fair value of these financial instruments based on changes in the market rate of interest on this debt 
the ultimate value of these notes will be determined by actual market prices  as all of these notes are tradable 
we estimate that a hypothetical basis point increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease in the aggregate fair value of the notes to approximately million and a hypothetical basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in the increase of the fair value of the notes to approximately million
