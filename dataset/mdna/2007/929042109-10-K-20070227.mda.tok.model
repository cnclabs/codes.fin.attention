in addition  we have a interest in americold realty trust americold  which owns and operates cold storage warehouses nationwide and a interest in toys r us  inc toys which has a significant real estate component  as well as other real estate and related investments 
our business objective is to maximize shareholder value 
we measure our success in meeting this objective by the total return to our shareholders 
below is a table comparing our performance to the morgan stanley reit index rms for the following periods ending december total return vornado rms one year three years five years ten years past performance is not necessarily indicative of how we will perform in the future 
we intend to achieve our business objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and executing our operating strategies through maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit  investing in properties in select markets  such as new york city and washington  dc  where we believe there is high likelihood of capital appreciation  acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents  investing in retail properties in select under stored locations such as the new york city metropolitan area  investing in fully integrated operating companies that have a significant real estate component  developing and redeveloping our existing properties to increase returns and maximize value  and providing specialty financing to real estate related companies 
we compete with a large number of real estate property owners and developers 
principal factors of competition are rent charged  attractiveness of location and quality and breadth of services provided 
our success depends upon  among other factors  trends of the national  regional and local economies  financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers  availability and cost of capital  construction and renovation costs  taxes  governmental regulations  legislation and population trends 
economic growth has been fostered  in part  by low interest rates  federal tax cuts  and increases in government spending 
to the extent economic growth stalls  we may experience lower occupancy rates which may lead to lower initial rental rates  higher leasing costs and a corresponding decrease in net income  funds from operations and cash flow 
alternatively  if economic growth is sustained  we may experience higher occupancy rates leading to higher initial rents and higher interest rates causing an increase in our weighted average cost of capital and a corresponding effect on net income  funds from operations and cash flow 
our net income and funds from operations will also be affected by the seasonality of the toys business and competition from discount and mass merchandisers

on july   two corporations owned by h street filed a complaint against the company  h street and three parties affiliated with the sellers of h street in the superior court of the district of columbia alleging that we encouraged h street and the affiliated parties to breach their fiduciary duties to these corporations and interfered with prospective business and contractual relationships 
the complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages and a rescission of our acquisition of h street 
on september   we filed a complaint against each of those corporations and their acting directors seeking a restoration of h street s full shareholder rights and damages 
in addition  on july   a tenant under ground leases for which one of these owned corporations is landlord brought a separate suit in the superior court of the district of columbia  alleging  among other things  that the acquisition of h street violated a provision giving them a right of first offer and seeks rescission of our acquisition  the right to acquire h street for the price paid by us and or damages 
on july   we filed a counterclaim against the tenant asserting that the tenant and the other owner of the owned ground landlord deliberately excluded h street from negotiating and executing a purported amendment to the agreement to lease when h street s consent and execution was required and  consequently  that the amended agreement and the related ground leases are invalid  the tenant is in default under the ground leases and the ground leases are void and without any effect 
these legal actions are currently in the discovery stage 
we believe that the actions filed against us are without merit and that we will ultimately be successful in defending against them 
prior to june   the two owned entities that are contesting our acquisition of h street impeded access to their financial information and accordingly  we were unable to record our pro rata share of their earnings 
during the second half of  based on the financial information they provided to us  we recognized equity in net income of  from these entities  of which  represented our share of their earnings for the period from july  date of acquisition to december  the lexington master limited partnership  formerly the newkirk master limited partnership we own approximately  limited partnership units representing a ownership interest of lexington master limited partnership lexington mlp as a result of the acquisition of newkirk realty trust newkirk by lexington corporate properties trust lexington discussed below 
on december   newkirk nyse nkt was acquired in a merger by lexington nyse lxp  a real estate investment trust 
we owned  limited partnership units representing a ownership interest of newkirk mlp  which was also acquired by lexington as a subsidiary  and was renamed lexington mlp 
the units in newkirk mlp were converted on a for basis into limited partnership units of lexington mlp  which are exchangeable on a one for one basis into common shares of lexington 
we account for our investment in lexington mlp on the equity method 
the assets of newkirk mlp consisted of million square feet of real estate across states 
after completion of the merger  lexington s total portfolio is comprised of approximately properties containing an aggregate of million square feet  located in states and the netherlands 
in addition  effective as of the effective time of the merger  newkirk terminated its advisory agreement with nkt advisors  in which we had a interest  for an aggregate payment of  of which our share was  on december   we recognized a net gain of  as a result of the above transactions 
overview continued unsecured notes consent solicitation on may   we executed supplemental indentures with respect to our senior unsecured notes due  and collectively  the notes  pursuant to our consent solicitation statement dated april   as amended 
holders of approximately of the aggregate principal amount of the notes consented to the solicitation 
the supplemental indentures contain modifications of certain covenants and related defined terms governing the terms of the notes to make them consistent with corresponding provisions of the covenants and defined terms included in the senior unsecured notes due issued on february  the supplemental indentures also include a new covenant that provides for an increase in the interest rate of the notes upon certain decreases in the ratings assigned by rating agencies to the notes 
in connection with the consent solicitation we paid an aggregate fee of  to the consenting note holders  which will be amortized into expense over the remaining term of the notes 
in addition  we incurred advisory and professional fees aggregating  which were expensed in the second quarter of overview continued leasing activity the following table summarizes  by business segment  the leasing statistics which we view as key performance indicators

critical accounting policies in preparing the consolidated financial statements we have made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that we believe are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies included in note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
real estate real estate is carried at cost  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization 
as of december  and  the carrying amounts of real estate  net of accumulated depreciation  were billion and billion  respectively 
maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
depreciation requires an estimate by management of the useful life of each property and improvement as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property to its various components 
if we do not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimate the useful lives of our real estate  depreciation expense may be misstated 
upon the acquisition of real estate  we assess the fair value of acquired assets including land  buildings and improvements  identified intangibles such as acquired above and below market leases and acquired in place leases and customer relationships and acquired liabilities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
business combinations and sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  and we allocate purchase price based on these assessments 
we assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results  known trends  and market economic conditions 
our properties  including any related intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
if we incorrectly estimate the values at acquisition or the undiscounted cash flows  initial allocations of purchase price and future impairment charges may be different 
the impact of our estimates in connection with acquisitions and future impairment analysis could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
identified intangible assets upon an acquisition of a business we record intangible assets acquired at their estimated fair value separate and apart from goodwill 
we amortize identified intangible assets that are determined to have finite lives which are based on the period over which the assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the business acquired 
intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset  including the related real estate when appropriate  is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value 
as of december  and  the carrying amounts of identified intangible assets were  and  respectively 
such amounts are included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  we had  and  of identified intangible liabilities as of december  and  which are included in deferred credit on our consolidated balance sheets 
if these assets are deemed to be impaired  or the estimated useful lives of finite life intangibles assets or liabilities change  the impact to our consolidated financial statements could be material 
notes and mortgage loans receivable we record mortgages and notes receivable at the stated principal amount net of any discount or premium 
as of december  and  the carrying amounts of notes and mortgage loans receivable were  and  respectively 
we accrete or amortize any discounts or premiums over the life of the related receivable utilizing the effective interest method  or straight line method if the result is not materially different 
we evaluate the collectibility of both interest and principal of each of our loans  if circumstances warrant  to determine whether they are impaired 
a loan is impaired when based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms 
when a loan is impaired  the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by comparing the recorded investment to the value determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at the loan s effective interest rate or  as a practical expedient  to the value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the impact of our estimates in connection with the collectibility of both interest and principal of our loans could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
partially owned entities as of december  and  the carrying amounts of investments and advances to partially owned entities  including alexander s and toys r us  were billion and billion  respectively 
in determining whether we have a controlling interest in a partially owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity  we consider factors such as ownership interest  board representation  management representation  authority to make decisions  and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners members as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity in which we will absorb the majority of the entity s expected losses  if they occur  or receive the majority of the expected residual returns  if they occur  or both 
we account for investments on the equity method when the requirements for consolidation are not met  and we have significant influence over the operations of the investee 
equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of net income or loss and cash contributions and distributions 
investments that do not qualify for consolidation or equity method accounting are accounted for on the cost method 
our investments in partially owned entities are reviewed for impairment  periodically  if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of our investments may not be recoverable 
the ultimate realization of our investments in partially owned entities is dependent on a number of factors  including the performance of each investment and market conditions 
we will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary 
allowance for doubtful accounts we periodically evaluate the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts  and  as of december  and for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under their lease agreements 
we also maintain an allowance for receivables arising from the straight lining of rents  and  as of december  and 
this receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements 
management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates 
these estimates may differ from actual results  which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we have the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies base rent income arising from tenant leases 
these rents are recognized over the non cancelable term of the related leases on a straight line basis which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements under the leases 
we commence rental revenue recognition when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use 
in addition  in circumstances where we provide a tenant improvement allowance for improvements that are owned by the tenant  we recognize the allowance as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
percentage rent income arising from retail tenant leases that is contingent upon the sales of the tenant exceeding a defined threshold 
these rents are recognized in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition  which states that this income is to be recognized only after the contingency has been removed ie  sales thresholds have been achieved 
hotel revenue income arising from the operation of the hotel pennsylvania which consists of rooms revenue  food and beverage revenue  and banquet revenue 
income is recognized when rooms are occupied 
food and beverage and banquet revenue are recognized when the services have been rendered 
trade shows revenue income arising from the operation of trade shows  including rentals of booths 
this revenue is recognized when the trade shows have occurred 
expense reimbursements revenue arising from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property 
this revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred 
temperature controlled logistics revenue income arising from our investment in americold 
storage and handling revenue are recognized as services are provided 
transportation fees are recognized upon delivery to customers 
management  leasing and other fees income arising from contractual agreements with third parties or with partially owned entities 
this revenue is recognized as the related services are performed under the respective agreements 
before we recognize revenue  we assess  among other things  its collectibility 
if our assessment of the collectibility of our revenue changes  the impact on our consolidated financial statements could be material 
income taxes we operate in a manner intended to enable us to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust reit under sections of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
under those sections  a reit which distributes at least of its reit taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders 
we distribute to our shareholders of our taxable income 
therefore  no provision for federal income taxes is required 
if we fail to distribute the required amount of income to our shareholders  or fail to meet other reit requirements  we may fail to qualify as a reit and substantial adverse tax consequences may result

net income and ebitda by segment for the years ended december   and ebitda represents earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
management considers ebitda a supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing the un levered performance of its segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity 
as properties are bought and sold based on a multiple of ebitda  management utilizes this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of its assets to that of its peers

nareit defines ffo as net income or loss determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding extraordinary items as defined under gaap and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets  plus specified non cash items  such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo and ffo per diluted share are used by management  investors and industry analysts as supplemental measures of operating performance of equity reits 
ffo and ffo per diluted share should be evaluated along with gaap net income and income per diluted share the most directly comparable gaap measures  as well as cash flow from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities  in evaluating the operating performance of equity reits 
management believes that ffo and ffo per diluted share are helpful to investors as supplemental performance measures because these measures exclude the effect of depreciation  amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate  all of which are based on historical costs which implicitly assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  these non gaap measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity reits 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as disclosed in our statements of cash flows 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity

in addition  we are  and may in the future be  subject to additional expense based on the notional amount of the derivative positions and a specified spread over libor
