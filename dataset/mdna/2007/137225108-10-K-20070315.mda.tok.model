item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
qualifying statement with respect to forward looking information and risks the following information contains forward looking information 
see cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements above and forward looking statements below 
our activities and investments in our common stock involve a high degree of risk 
each of the risks in item a risk factors may have a significant impact on our future financial condition and results of operations 
the following should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto included herein 

table of contents general we are an independent energy company engaged in operations located primarily in countries comprising the former soviet union involving the acquisition  exploration  development  production and marketing of crude oil and  to a lesser extent  natural gas 
our principal means of growth has been through the acquisition and subsequent development and exploitation of producing oil and gas properties by means of entering into production sharing arrangements and licence arrangements with governmental or local oil companies 
as a result of our historical exploration and acquisition activities  we believe that we have a substantial inventory of exploitation and development opportunities  the successful completion of which is critical to the maintenance and growth of our current production levels 
we have incurred net losses in the last five years  and there can be no assurance that operating income and net earnings will be achieved in future periods 
our financial results depend upon many factors  particularly the following factors which most significantly affect our results of operations the sales prices of crude oil and  to a lesser extent  natural gas  the level of total sales volumes of crude oil and  to a lesser extent  natural gas  the availability of  and our ability to raise additional  capital resources and provide liquidity to meet cash flow needs  and the level and success of exploration and development activity 
reserves and production volumes year end gross total proved oil reserves at the ninotsminda field were mmbbl down from s mmbbl 
over the same period  gross total proved natural gas reserves from the ninotsminda field on georgia and the kyzyloi field in kazakhstan were billion cubic feet down from s billion cubic feet 
because our proved reserves will decline as crude oil and natural gas and natural gas liquids are produced unless we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves or conduct successful exploration and development activities  our reserves and production will decrease 
our ability to acquire or find additional reserves in the near future will be dependent  in part  upon the amount of available funds for acquisition  exploitation and development projects 
exploitation and development activity ninotsminda following the rehabilitation and development work undertaken on the ninotsminda field  we realised that the performance of wells was being negatively impacted by being drilled over balanced with conventional drilling methods and we decided to employ under balanced drilling technology in order to maximise productivity and recoverability from the field 
it was planned that future horizontal wells on the field should be drilled using this technology 
in june  we signed a contract with weus holding inc  a subsidiary of weatherford international ltd weatherford  for the supply of under balanced coiled tubing drilling ubctd services to our projects in georgia 
under the terms of the contract  weatherford were to supply and operate a ubctd unit to be used on a program of up to horizontal well bores on our ninotsminda and samgori fields we were party to the samgori psc at this time 
elsewhere in the oil industry  the use of under balanced drilling techniques has been shown to result in significantly less formation damage  resulting in higher sustained production rates and ultimate recovery 
at the same time  utilisation of coiled tubing drilling gives greater flexibility in the drilling process and in the control of the horizontal section 
it was considered that these combined drilling technologies would provide the best way to develop and produce both the ninotsminda and samgori fields 
we planned to drill at least five under balanced horizontal sidetracks on the ninotsminda field and ubctd operations started on the first well in the program  the nh well  in december  but due to technical problems with the equipment the under balanced drilling was not completed until late february and then only with a much shorter than planned section being drilled  and the well not achieving its objective  despite flowing gas at reported high rates through the gas cap section 
subsequent operations by weatherford on both 
table of contents nh and nh wells also proved unsuccessful  with weatherford failing to drill any horizontal section in these wells 
progress was hampered by multiple failures of the downhole motors  other equipment malfunctions and the loss of bottom hole assemblies in the wells 
following the failure of weatherford to successfully complete any horizontal sidetrack development wells on the ninotsminda field using ubctd technology  weatherford demobilized its equipment and left georgia in july despite this lack of success  which we attribute mainly to multiple equipment failures  we still believe that under balanced technology is an appropriate technology for the development of this type of reservoir 
however  as we withdrew from the samgori psc in february  it would be prohibitively expensive to mobilise an ubctd unit to georgia solely for a drilling campaign on the ninotsminda field and we are considering other ways in which to most efficiently produce the remaining reserves of the field 
in the meantime  we have continued with our jointed pipe drilling operations using our own rigs and equipment and the directional drilling services of baker hughes international to drill horizontal sidetrack wells on the ninotsminda field 
in october we completed the nh sidetrack which tested at a rate of up to mmcf mcm of gas per day plus barrels of condensate per day a total of  barrels oil equivalent on a inch mm choke with a flowing tubing head pressure fthp of atmospheres  psig 
the well is currently choked back as we await completion of repairs by the state owned gas transportation company to the mile km pipeline which is planned will deliver the gas from ninotsminda to the local state run thermal electricity generating station at gardabani 
a gas supply agreement was concluded in june with the expectation that sales would commence in september  but repairs to the pipeline have not yet been completed and are unlikely to be completed in time to take delivery of gas during this winter season 
the latest horizontal sidetrack well to be drilled on the field was the nh well which we completed in march it targeted oil volumes un drained from previous offset area wells and was put on production test following the installation of a slotted liner over a  feet meters interval furthest from the heel of the well 
the well produced initially with a high water cut  approximately  and an oil rate which peaked at barrels of oil per day bopd before declining 
subsequent pressure surveys run with downhole gauges suggested that the nh well was in communication with the offset nh well 
the most likely assumed scenario was then some of the fracture sets encountered at the end of the nh well were drained by the nh well and were hence water filled 
once a very high permeability connection is established with the aquifer  water will flow in preference to any oil filled fractures or matrix of lower permeability 
on the basis of the test data and due to the fact that the nh well is approximately feet meters structurally higher than the nh well which is still producing oil  we decided to attempt to conduct remedial water isolation 
the slotted liner deployed in the horizontal section limited mechanical options for shutting off the toe end of the horizontal section 
previous experience in the field has shown that pulling a liner once set has a very low chance of success due to formation collapse around the liner 
also  a traditional cement isolation was considered to have a low chance of success in a horizontal section  so we opted for a coiled tubing deployed chemical shut off 
water isolation operations were conducted during the summer months but subsequent production testing showed that the treatment was not successful 
we now plan to set a cement retainer in the solid liner section of the nh well in order to isolate and abandon the slotted liner part  but this operation has been significantly delayed awaiting delivery of the retainer 
the liner through the heel section of the well will then be perforated and the well tested 
the build up and heel section of the well is in a crestal location on the field and there has been little previous offset production 
in  we plan to implement a modest work program aimed at maintaining and or increasing production from the ninotsminda field 
at the same time  we plan to complete a geological  geophysical and engineering re evaluation of the field with a view to determining the best approach to developing the remaining reserves of the field 
the eastern part of the field is largely un drained with potentially significant remaining recoverable oil 
this area represents approximately of the entire structure as mapped and the only producing well in this part of the field is the n well which has produced  barrels of oil to date at a constant rate of bopd 
table of contents since drilled in  thus demonstrating the potential in this area 
the selection of a drilling location will be based on the results of the planned technical study 
kyzyloi on the kyzyloi gas field a development program is underway 
the field contains sweet natural gas methane reservoired in shallow sandstones at a depth of approximately  feet meters which was discovered  but not developed  during the s 
this field is located close to the bukhara urals gas trunkline  and to the south of the bozoi gas storage facility 
bnm has carried out an extensive workover and testing program on the kyzyloi field wells  and the six wells tested to date for the initial development have flowed at a cumulative rate of over mmcf mcm of gas per day 
a gathering system  mile km pipeline and compressor station is in the process of construction to connect the kyzyloi development to the bukhara urals gas trunkline  with the initial planned production rate being mmcf mcm per day and with first gas planned for late spring bnm believes that there is significant additional potential both in the kyzyloi field and in its surrounding akkulka exploration contract area 
as such the pipeline and associated facilities are being designed such that they could be upgraded to throughput up to mmcf  mcm per day of gas production 
production from the kyzyloi field will be delivered under a natural gas supply contract concluded between bnm and gaz impex in january the contract  which has a term until june  is based on a take or pay principle and covers all gas produced from the kyzyloi field production contract area 
the delivery point under the contract will be the planned tie in point to the bukhara urals gas trunkline 
the price of gas at the delivery point averages per mcf per mcm over the life of the contract  with gaz impex providing bank guarantees against payment 
bnm plans to invest approximately million in the kyzyloi development in while a considerable amount of infrastructure for the kyzyloi field has already been put in place  and although tested gas wells exist on the kyzyloi field we cannot provide assurance that funding of the development plan for the field will be timely  formalisation of the production contract extension will be achieved  gas sales will operate according to the sales contract and at planned volumes  that the development plan will be successfully completed  or that operating revenues from the field after completion of the development plan will exceed operating costs 
if crude oil and  to a lesser extent  natural gas prices return to depressed levels or if our production from our development program does not deliver a significant production increase  our revenues  cash flow from operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected

exploration and appraisal manavi the first exploration well  manavi m  drilled on the manavi structure reached a total depth td of  feet  meters in the cretaceous in september the well encountered the cretaceous limestone target at  feet  meters with over feet meters of hydrocarbons indicated on wireline logs and with no evidence of an oil water contact present 
on test the m well flowed light sweet api oil at a visibly significant rate and at a high pressure prior to the test being terminated due to the mechanical failure of the production tubing 
oil was also discovered in the shallower middle eocene sequence  but was not tested 
the well was prepared and subsequently sidetracked in a slim hole using a saipem spa saipem ideco e az drilling rig equipped with a top drive drilling system  and an oil based mud system provided by 
table of contents baker hughes international baker to control the swelling clays which had proved difficult to drill in the original well 
the manavi mz well reached a td of  feet  meters in the cretaceous in october the primary cretaceous limestone target was encountered at  feet  meters some feet meters higher than in the original m well while the secondary middle eocene target zone was penetrated at  feet  meters again significantly higher than in the m well 
the carbonate section itself was proven to be approximately feet meters thick 
drilling data and slim hole wireline logs indicated the presence of hydrocarbons in both the cretaceous and middle eocene target zones  again no oil water contact was identified 
due to the small size of the well bore and realising that this would not enable an optimal test of the structure  we decided to delay completion of this test until after the completion of the planned m appraisal well 
drilling operations at the first appraisal site  m using the saipem rig and baker oil based mud services commenced on february   however  due to technical problems and having to sidetrack the well meant the well did not reach td until mid december the well was drilled to a depth of  feet  meters in the cretaceous interval with the top of the carbonate section being penetrated at  feet  meters 
significant hydrocarbon shows whilst drilling and wireline logs indicate a potentially significant hydrocarbon column in the well with no definitive presence of a hydrocarbon water contact 
the lower part of the carbonate section where a major gas influx occurred whilst drilling together with the underlying interbedded carbonates and tuffs appear to have the best reservoir characteristics 
on setting the production liner  we planned to perform an initial short term production test of the well prior to demobilizing the rig and then undertake a more comprehensive test as part of a longer term production test after the site would be cleared and appropriate additional testing equipment installed 
an feet meter pre perforated production liner was run over the section of the reservoir believed to have the better reservoir characteristics and a production testing string set to test the cretaceous carbonate and interbedded units 
during setting of the test string  the well began flowing and it was necessary to increase the mud weight to control the well whilst the test string was set 
despite the flow and gas observed at surface during drilling operations  the initial testing operations resulted in a pressure increase at surface but with no discernable flow 
subsequent re perforating of parts of the test interval has resulted in minor flow with gas being flared and black o api oil collected at surface 
however it is considered likely that formation damage has occurred  probably whilst controlling the well during the setting of the test string  with mud penetrating and blocking the formation 
therefore stimulation techniques using acid to clean the well and create conductive pathways from the reservoir to the well bore and hence bypass any reservoir damage will be required to fully production test the potential of the well 
this is a fairly common procedure required in carbonate reservoirs in the area which produce prolifically in the north caucasus 
on february  we announced that the saipem drilling rig has now been demobilised from the m site and preparations have commenced for the acid stimulation of the reservoir and the resumption of the testing program 
fractech ltd  a uk company providing independent well completion and stimulation laboratory testing  design and consultancy services  and schlumberger well completions experts have been consulted and have advised on the chemicals for the test 
these chemicals have been sourced in germany by schlumberger and are currently on route to georgia 
the stimulation itself will be performed through coiled tubing and this unit is already on site and has commenced cleaning the well in advance of spotting the acid 
the acid treatment is expected to commence around the middle of march but  a number of acid treatments may be required which will take approximately two to three weeks to complete before the effectiveness of the stimulation can be determined 
if the stimulation is successful  we will proceed to test the well with the aim of putting it into early production  however  if further stimulation is required  we would then plan to use hydraulic fracturing techniques in order to fully eliminate the potential formation damage 
if the contingent hydraulic fracturing program is deemed to be required  it will be necessary to bring in specialist equipment to georgia  and the company is currently ascertaining the availability of such equipment 
although management is excited about the potential of the manavi prospect  a fair amount of additional drilling and analysis is still required before we will be able to fully evaluate the reserves and productive possibilities of this prospect 
as part of this analysis  
table of contents we are also evaluating the technical feasibility of acquiring a d seismic data survey over the manavi structure 
given significant production is tested from the m well we would then proceed to test the mz well  and would aim to place both wells on long term test production which would involve putting in place an early production facility 
norio the second phase of the preliminary work program under the norio psa commenced in january when the first exploration well named mk was spudded on the norio prospect using the canargo ural mash rig 
norio is a large prospect identified at middle eocene level and is analogous in size to the nearby samgori and ninotsminda field complex immediately to the south and east of the block 
it has been reported that the samgori oil field alone has produced approximately million barrels of oil to date 
completion of the mk well was delayed as a result of technical problems encountered whilst drilling  and the need to farm out a portion of the equity in the block in order to partly fund the drilling 
in september  cnl signed a farm in agreement relating to the norio psa with a wholly owned subsidiary of georgian oil  the georgian state oil company 
this farm in agreement obligated georgian oil to pay up to million to deepen  to a planned depth of  feet  meters the mk well in return for a interest in the contractor share of the norio psa 
georgian oil also had an option  exercisable for a limited period after completion of the well  to increase its interest to of the contractor share of the norio psa on payment to cnl of million 
due to georgian oil s inability to continue to fund the drilling of the well  operations were subsequently suspended and only resumed after may when we repaid to georgian oil the investment it had made in the mk well to terminate the farm in agreement and option and secure a working interest in the norio psa 
in august the saipem drilling rig and baker oil based mud system was mobilized to the mk exploration well as our ural mash rig had difficulty drilling through a highly over pressured section of swelling clays above the prognosed target zone 
on december   we announced that the mk well reached a depth of  feet  meters in the middle eocene reservoir having encountered very good oil and gas shows 
before the well could be drilled to the planned depth and tested  the bottom hole assembly bha became stuck due to hole collapse 
subsequent attempts to retrieve the bha were not successful and we decided to abandon the lower target due to a limited chance of sidetracking the well at this depth in a small diameter hole and to focus our attention on the shallower oil discovery in the overlying oligocene sands which were the secondary target for the well 
from the data obtained from the middle eocene the primary target for the well we believe that an oil discovery has been made at this level  and that the reservoir has exhibited both permeability and the presence of movable light oil 
as such  even though the middle eocene has not been fully evaluated  the mk well has encountered the middle eocene reservoir on prognosis  and with hydrocarbons thus achieving many of the objectives of this wildcat exploration well 
a comprehensive testing program on the oil bearing oligocene sandstones encountered in the norio mk well commenced in mid march when a total of feet meters of net sands were perforated over the interval  feet  meters to  feet  meters 
these sands had good oil shows whilst drilling  with oil to surface and with hydrocarbons being interpreted on the electric logs which also indicated a substantial thickness of net pay sands 
following an extensive testing program  the well sustained flow on a small choke size with low average gross fluid rates of approximately barrels per day consisting of light api oil  gas and water 
a number of surge clean up flows  a re perforation of selected intervals  and a low pressure hydrofrac using our own pumping unit have been attempted but these have not improved reservoir deliverability 
it is believed that the current flow is limited to a thinner  less permeable  interval whilst the better quality reservoir remains isolated due to potential reservoir damage caused by the invasive fluid damage of the drilling mud 
the lower zones in the well  which would have been in communication with the oligocene interval through the well bore  were drilled with a to specific gravity sg mud due to anticipated reservoir pressures while the results from the testing program indicate that the mid interval reservoir pressure for the oligocene whilst still over pressured  is lower at sg equivalent 

table of contents as a result of possible mud damage  the current perforations may have not penetrated deep enough beyond the damaged zone to allow proper communication between the more permeable formations and the well bore 
we considered mobilising a more powerful fraccing unit and equipment to georgia in order to pump a propant and fluid into the well at high pressure and volume  but the potential for this technology is limited due to a lack of a cement bond behind the casing and the large interval which has been perforated 
the well has been left on test production for the past several months but there has been no discernable increase in gross fluid production rate 
as we would appear to have exhausted all the low cost options available to us at this time to bypass any damage that may exist in the near well bore area and establish better communication between the well bore and the reservoir  we believe that the only effective option remaining is to sidetrack the well or to drill a new well 
the latter  of course  would enable us to attempt to test both the oligocene and middle eocene intervals both of which are considered to have significantly reduced geological risk 
we plan  subject to financing being available from internal resources or through a farm out arrangement  to drill an appraisal well to fully evaluate these attractive discoveries  with the well being designed to enter the middle eocene reservoir with a larger hole size 
kumisi in february  we announced that we had commenced drilling an appraisal well  kumisi  on the kumisi gas prospect within the nazvrevi block xiii psc area 
a gas discovery was made in the cretaceous in the wrk well in soviet times but never appraised 
the prospect which is potentially of very significant size is situated up dip of the wr well with the principal risk being closure on the structure 
this prospect is located approximately miles km southeast of tbilisi and is close to the domestic gas infrastructure and the route of the new south caucasus gas trunkline from azerbaijan to turkey  and is approximately miles km west of the gardabani thermal power plant and rustavi industrial complex 
on march  we announced that our subsidiary  canargo nazvrevi limited cnz has signed a memorandum of understanding mou with the georgian government which includes the terms of a take or pay natural gas supply contract relating to gas sales from the kumisi gas prospect within the nazvrevi block xiii psc area 
the gas supply contract will be with the georgian state  secured against appropriate bank guarantees  in which cnz will supply gas from kumisi based on a pricing formula under which gas is initially supplied at a contract price of per mcf per mcm  increasing to per mcf per mcm by the tenth contract year  after which escalation will be based on european union heavy fuel oil price changes 
the contract will be for the entire field life 
however  after the tenth year  cnz has the option of selling to third parties if the price obtained is above the contract price at that time 
the well which is being drilled with canargo rig is expected to reach total depth of  feet  meters in the cretaceous by late june 
surface casing has been set at a depth of  feet meters and the well is currently drilling ahead at approximately  feet  meters in the middle eocene 
in  we have budgeted approximately million for our exploration and appraisal work in georgia  primarily for the testing and appraisal of the manavi discovery and drilling the kumisi well 
akkulka greater akkulka in early bnm undertook a five well exploration program targeting shallow gas anomalies which may be similar to the kyzyloi field within the akkulka exploration contract area 
all five of these wells had gas indications on wireline logs and to date two have been fully production tested  namely akk and akk the akk well  located miles km north east of the kyzyloi field  flowed gas at a rate of mmcf mcm per day 
this well effectively extended the kyzyloi field to the north east  including an untested fault block ne kyzyloi  and work is currently underway with respect to extending the area of the kyzyloi production contract to include the akk well which will be included as a production well in the kyzyloi field development 
the akk exploration well  located some miles km east of the kyzyloi field  flowed gas at a stabilized flow rate of mmcf mcm of gas per day  and this well  now named 
table of contents central akkulka  has been declared a commercial discovery by bnm 
an appraisal exploration well akk was drilled by bnm late in to appraise and extend the central akkulka accumulation to the south west 
this well had gas indications on the wireline logs but remains to be tested as part of an integrated testing program currently underway 
it is planned to tie the akk discovery into the kyzyloi development  initially by way of a long term extended well test  but then by the application for a separate production contract  once the central akkulka accumulation has been fully evaluated 
in the other three exploration wells which have been drilled to date  akk  akk and akk  gas indications were observed during drilling and in thin sands on wireline logs 
these sands are present at several stratigraphic levels within the wells 
akk lies to the north east of the kyzyloi field on a prospect named north akkulka 
testing of the akk well is planned for q as part of the current integrated testing program 
the akk and akk wells lie to the south east of the kyzyloi field on a prospect named south akkulka 
akk is up dip of akk and encountered a gas bubble whilst drilling and with gas being noted on the wellhead 
this well is currently being fully tested 
the downdip well akk  which has thin sandstones showing possible gas on wireline logs but with relatively high water saturations  was tested and flowed water from these sands  this well therefore delineating the downdip extent of the south akkulka at this level although higher untested sands do exist prospect which remains to be tested for commercial flow by the akk well 
further exploration continues on the akkulka block with four more wells planned for currently the akk south west akkulka well is drilling and is currently at a depth of feet meters 
bnm plans to invest approximately million on the akkulka exploration contract area during on the greater akkulka exploration and production contract area initial seismic mapping has shown the presence of additional potential shallow gas prospects at similar levels to those on akkulka  and with some slightly deeper plays 
additional d seismic data is being acquired this year on the greater akkulka contract area as part of the work commitment under the contract and to infill the western part of the area prior to the contractual relinquishment of of the area at the end of a seismic contractor has been selected and work is expected to commence in the summer of bnm plans to invest approximately million on the greater akkulka contract area during to pursue existing projects beyond our immediate development plan and to pursue new opportunities  we will require additional capital 
while expected to be substantial  without further exploration work and evaluation the exact amount of funds needed to fully develop all of our oil and gas properties cannot at present  be quantified 
potential sources of funds include additional sales of equity securities  project financing  debt financing and the participation of other oil and gas entities in our projects 
based on our past history of raising capital and continuing discussions  management believes that such required funds may be available 
however  there is no assurance that such funds will be available  and if available  will be offered on attractive or acceptable terms 
should such funding not be forthcoming and we are unable to sell some or all of our non core assets  or  if sold  such sales realize insufficient proceeds  we may have to delay or abandon such projects 
development of the oil and gas properties and ventures in which we have interests involves multi year efforts and substantial cash expenditures 
full development of our oil and gas properties and ventures will require the availability of substantial additional financing from external sources 
we may also  where opportunities exist  seek to transfer portions of our interests in oil and gas properties and ventures to entities in exchange for such financing 
we generally have the principal responsibility for arranging financing for the oil and gas properties and ventures in which we have an interest 
there can be no assurance  however  that we or the entities that are developing the oil and gas properties and ventures will be able to arrange the financing necessary to develop the projects being undertaken or to support our corporate and other activities 
there can also be no assurance that such financing as is available will be on terms that are attractive or acceptable to or are deemed to be in the best interest of canargo  such entities and their respective stockholders or participants 

table of contents ultimate realization of the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and ventures will require production of oil and gas in sufficient quantities and marketing such oil and gas at sufficient prices to provide positive cash flow to us 
establishment of successful oil and gas operations is dependent upon  among other factors  the following mobilization of equipment and personnel to implement effectively drilling  completion and production activities  raising of additional capital  achieving significant production at costs that provide acceptable margins  reasonable levels of taxation  or economic arrangements in lieu of taxation in host countries  and the ability to market the oil and gas produced at or near world prices 
subject to our ability to raise additional capital  we have plans to mobilize resources and achieve levels of production and profits sufficient to recover the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and ventures 
however  if one or more of the above factors  or other factors  are different than anticipated  these plans may not be realized  and we may not recover the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and ventures 
commencing in july through july an aggregate of million in indebtedness under the company s senior secured notes  the subordinated notes  the subordinated notes and the tethys bridge financing collectively  the notes will come due and be payable 
unless such notes are converted into shares of common stock in accordance with their respective terms  the company will be required to repay or refinance such outstanding indebtedness 
there can be no assurance at this time that company will have the resources to repay such notes or if it will be in a position to refinance such indebtedness 
the notes are secured by all the assets of the company 
availability of capital as described more fully under liquidity and capital resources below  our sources of capital are primarily cash on hand  cash from operating activities  project financing  debt financing  the participation of other oil and gas entities in our projects  and the proceeds from the sale of certain assets 
we may also attempt to raise additional capital through the issuance of debt or equity securities although no assurances can be made that we will be successful in any such efforts 
as of february   the company had an aggregate of  shares of common stock issued and outstanding and  authorized shares of common stock 
during  we issued  shares of our common stock of which  shares were in connection with the conversion of a convertible loan   shares were in connection with exercise of stock options and  shares were in connection with a private placement 
during  we have to date issued  shares of our common stock in connection with an exercise of warrants and  shares in connection with an exercise of employee stock options 

as of march   an aggregate of  shares are reserved for issuance under various stock option plans  warrants and other contractual commitments  including the senior secured notes  the subordinated notes and the subordinated note 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources general the crude oil and natural gas industry is a highly capital intensive and cyclical business 
our current capital requirements are driven principally by our obligations to fund the following costs the development of existing properties  including drilling and completion costs of wells  and acquisition of interests in crude oil and natural gas properties 
the amount of capital available to us will affect our ability to continue to grow the business through the development of existing properties and the acquisition of new properties and  possibly  our ability to service any future debt obligations  if any 
our sources of capital are primarily cash on hand  cash from operating activities  project financing  debt financing  the participation of other oil and gas entities in our projects  and the sale of certain assets 
our overall liquidity depends heavily on the prevailing prices of crude oil and natural gas and our production volumes of crude oil and natural gas 
we do not hedge our crude oil production 
accordingly  future crude oil and  to a lesser extent  natural gas price declines would have a material adverse effect on our overall results  and therefore  our liquidity 
low crude oil and natural gas prices could also negatively affect our ability to raise capital on terms favorable to us and could also reduce our ability to borrow in the future 
if the volume of crude oil we produce decreases  our cash flow from operations will decrease 
our production volumes will decline as reserves are produced 
we sold properties in and which reduced potential future reserves and in the future  we may sell additional properties and other assets  which could further reduce our production volumes and income from oil well drilling and servicing 
to offset the loss in production volumes resulting from natural field declines and sales of producing properties  we must conduct successful exploration  exploitation and development activities  acquire additional producing properties as we did with our acquisition of a interest in the samgori field in or identify additional behind pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves 
should our current exploration  exploitation and development wells in georgia prove unsuccessful and we were unable to raise additional debt or equity finance  we might have to cut back on our capital spending plans and or modify our operating plans to conserve cash 
as of december   we had working capital of  compared to working capital of  as of december  the  decrease in working capital from december  to december  is principally due to expenditures in the period to fund the cost of preparing wells for our horizontal development program at the ninotsminda field  the appraisal of our manavi oil discovery in georgia  activities in kazakhstan and net cash used by operating activities partially offset by cash received pursuant to the subordinated notes  the subordinated notes  the tethys bridge financing  the sale of an aggregate of  shares of common stock in october  in an offshore private placement in norway pursuant to regulation s promulgated by the sec the reg 
s offering and the maturing of deposits previously recorded as restricted cash 
in may  noc entered into a crude oil sales agreement with primrose financial group pfg to sell its monthly share of oil produced under the ninotsminda production sharing contract with a total contractual commitment of  metric tonnes  bbls 
as security for payment and having the right to lift up to  metric tonnes approximately  bbls of oil per month  the buyer caused to be paid to noc  security deposit to be repaid at the end of the contract period either in money or through the delivery of additional crude oil equal to the value of the security 
the security deposit replaced the previous security payments totalling  which had been originally made available under previous oil sales agreements 
on february   noc and pfg agreed to the terminate the sales agreement and enter into a new agreement new agreement whereby pfg would receive an immediate repayment of its security deposit and obtain an extended term over which it can purchase crude oil produced from the ninotsminda field while noc receives better commercial terms for the sale of its production 
the new agreement had a minimum term of months

to pursue existing projects for our immediate appraisal and development plans  pay operating expenses and to pursue new opportunities  we will require additional capital in the second quarter of while expected to be substantial  without further exploration work and evaluation the exact amount of funds needed to fully develop all of our oil and gas properties cannot at present  be quantified 
potential sources of funds include additional sales of equity securities  project financing  debt financing and the participation of other oil and gas entities in our projects 
based on our past history of raising capital and continuing discussions  we believe that such required funds may be available 
however  there is no assurance that such funds will be available  and if available  will be offered on attractive or acceptable terms 
should such funding not be forthcoming  we may not be able to pursue projects beyond our current appraisal and development plans or to pursue new opportunities 
as discussed above  under the terms of the notes  we are restricted from incurring additional indebtedness 
development of the oil and gas properties and ventures in which we have interests involves multi year efforts and substantial cash expenditures 
full development of our oil and gas properties and ventures may require the availability of substantial additional financing from external sources 
we may also  where opportunities exist  seek to transfer portions of our interests in oil and gas properties and ventures to entities in exchange for such financing 
we generally have the principal responsibility for arranging financing for the oil and gas properties and ventures in which we have an interest

there can also be no assurance that such financing will be available on terms that are attractive or acceptable to or are deemed to be in the best interest of canargo  such entities and their respective stockholders or participants 

table of contents ultimate realization of the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and ventures will require production of oil and gas in sufficient quantities and marketing such oil and gas at sufficient prices to provide positive cash flow to canargo 
establishment of successful oil and gas operations is dependent upon  among other factors  the following mobilization of equipment and personnel to implement effectively drilling  completion and production activities  raising of additional capital  achieving significant production at costs that provide acceptable margins  reasonable levels of taxation  or economic arrangements in lieu of taxation in host countries  and the ability to market the oil and gas produced at or near world prices 
subject to our ability to raise additional capital  above  we have plans to mobilize resources and achieve levels of production and profits sufficient to recover the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and ventures 
however  if one or more of the above factors  or other factors  are different than anticipated  these plans may not be realized  and we may not recover the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and ventures

we have no material long term capital commitments and are consequently able to adjust the level of our expenditures as circumstances dictate 
additionally  the level of capital expenditures will vary during future periods depending on the results of our development and appraisal programs  market conditions and other related economic factors 
should the prices of crude oil and natural gas decline from current levels  our cash flows will decrease which may result in a reduction of the capital expenditures budget

the legislative and procedural regimes governing production sharing contracts and mineral use licenses in georgia have undergone a series of changes in recent years resulting in certain legal uncertainties 
our production sharing contracts and mineral use licenses  entered into prior to the introduction in of a new petroleum law governing such agreements have not  as yet  been amended to reflect or ensure compliance with current legislation 
as a result  despite references in the current legislation grandfathering the terms and conditions of our production sharing contracts  conflicts between the interpretation of our production sharing contracts and mineral use licenses and current legislation could arise 
such conflicts  if they arose  could cause an adverse effect on our rights under the production sharing contracts 
however  the norio psa and the tbilisi psc were concluded after enactment of the petroleum law  and under the terms and conditions of this legislation 
to confirm that the ninotsminda psc and the mineral usage license issued prior to the introduction in of the petroleum law were validly issued  in connection with its preparation of the convertible loan agreement with us  the international finance corporation  an affiliate of the world bank received in november confirmation from the state of georgia  that among other things the state of georgia recognizes and confirms the validity and enforceability of the production sharing contract and the license and all undertakings the state has covenanted with noc thereunder  the license was duly authorized and executed by the state at the time of its issuance and remained in full force and effect throughout its term  and the license constitutes a valid and duly authorized grant by the state  being and remaining in full force and effect as of the signing of this confirmation and the benefits of the license fully extend to noc by virtue of its interest in the license holder and the contractual rights under the production sharing contract 
despite this confirmation and the grandfathering of the terms of existing production sharing contracts in the petroleum law  subsequent legislative or other governmental changes could conflict with  challenge our rights or otherwise change current operations under the production sharing contract 
no challenge has been made to date 
in  the participation agreement for the three well exploration program on the ninotsminda manavi area with aes was terminated without aes earning any rights to any of the ninotsminda manavi area reservoirs 
the company therefore has no present obligations in respect of aes 
however  under a separate 
table of contents letter of agreement  if gas from the sub middle eocene is discovered and produced from the exploration area covered by the participation agreement  aes with be entitled to recover at the rate of of future gas sales from the sub middle eocene  net of operating costs  approximately  representing their prior funding under the participation agreement 
under the production sharing contract for blocks xi g and xi h the tbilisi psc our subsidiary canargo norio limited had a commitment to acquire additional seismic data within three years of the effective date of the contract which is september  the state agency for oil gas regulation in georgia the agency has consented to an extension to the period within which the data should be acquired and we are working with the agency to amend the tbilisi psc accordingly 
the total commitment over the remaining period is we have contingent obligations and may incur additional obligations  absolute or contingent  with respect to the acquisition and development of oil and gas properties and ventures in which we have interests that require or may require us to expend funds and to issue shares of our common stock 
upon completion of the acquisition of an interest in the samgori psc we had a contractual obligation to issue four million shares of canargo common stock to europa oil services limited europa  an unaffiliated company in connection with a consultancy agreement with europa in relation to this acquisition 
on april  europa was issued with four million restricted shares of canargo common stock in an arms length transaction 
a further million shares of canargo common stock are issuable upon certain production targets being met from future developments under the samgori psc 
as we have withdrawn from the samgori psc effective february   we have no continuing obligation to issue further shares of canargo common stock to europa 
on march   we signed an agreement with europa formally terminating the consultancy agreement

in december  we announced details of the conditional acquisition of certain oil and gas interests in kazakhstan which had previously been owned by the uk public company  atlantic caspian resources plc acr 
this was to be achieved through a newly established company  tethys petroleum investments limited now renamed tethys petroleum limited tpl on certain conditions being satisfied 
these interests were represented as including a interest in bn munai llp bnm  a kazakh limited liability partnership  which was represented as holding certain exploration and production interests in kazakhstan including the akkulka exploration licence and contract and kyzyloi production licence 
immediately prior to the agreement between tpl and acr  and as part of that transaction  we entered into an agreement allocating a interest in tpl to provincial securities limited an investment company to which mr 
russell hammond  one of our non executive directors  is an investment advisor in consideration for future services of providing advice  help and assistance concerning funding the development of tpl

transactions with affiliates are reviewed and voted on solely by non interested directors 
critical accounting policies natural gas and oil properties we utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to our natural gas and oil properties 
we review the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties under the full cost accounting rules of the sec 
under these rules  all such costs excluding significant acquisition  exploration and development costs related to unproved properties  are capitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties using the units of production method 
these capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test  however  which limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved gas and oil reserves discounted at 
table of contents percent plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties 
if the net capitalized costs of natural gas and oil properties exceed the ceiling  we will record a ceiling test write down to the extent of such excess 
a ceiling test write down is a non cash charge to earnings 
if required  it reduces earnings and impacts shareholders equity in the period of occurrence and results in lower depreciation  depletion and amortization expense in future periods 
the write down may not be reversed in future periods  even though higher natural gas and oil prices may subsequently increase the ceiling 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties increases when natural gas and oil prices are depressed or if there are substantial downward revisions in estimated proved reserves 
application of these rules during periods of relatively low natural gas or oil prices due to seasonality or other reasons  even if temporary  increases the probability of a ceiling test write down 
based on natural gas and oil prices in effect on december   the unamortized cost of our natural gas and oil properties did not exceed the ceiling of proved natural gas and oil reserves 
natural gas pricing has historically been unpredictable and any significant declines could result in a ceiling test write down in subsequent quarterly or annual reporting periods 
natural gas and oil reserves used in the full cost method of accounting cannot be measured exactly 
our estimate of natural gas and oil reserves requires extensive judgments of reservoir engineering data and is generally less precise than other estimates made in connection with financial disclosures 
assigning monetary values to such estimates does not reduce the subjectivity and changing nature of such reserve estimates 
the uncertainties inherent in the disclosure are compounded by applying additional estimates of the rates and timing of production and the costs that will be incurred in developing and producing the reserves 
we engage the services of an independent petroleum consulting firm to calculate reserves 
use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes that it is reasonably possible the following material estimates affecting the financial statements could significantly change in the coming year estimates of proved oil and gas reserves  estimates as to the expected future cash flow from proved oil and gas properties  and estimates of future dismantlement and restoration costs 
concentration of credit risk although our cash and temporary investments and accounts receivable are exposed to potential credit loss  we do not believe such risk to be significant 
even though a substantial amount of funds were in accounts at financial institutions which were not covered under bank guarantees  management does not believe that maintaining balances in excess of bank guarantees resulted in a significant risk to the company 
foreign operations our future operations and earnings will depend upon the results of our operations in georgia and kazakhstan 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully conduct such operations  and a failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
also  the success of our operations will be subject to numerous contingencies  some of which are beyond management control 
these contingencies include general and regional economic conditions  prices for crude oil and natural gas  competition and changes in regulation 
since we are dependent on international operations  specifically those in georgia and kazakhstan  we will be subject to various additional political  economic and other uncertainties 
among other risks  our operations may be subject to the risks and restrictions on transfer of funds  import and export duties  quotas and embargoes  domestic and international customs and tariffs  and changing taxation policies  foreign exchange restrictions  political conditions and regulations

forward looking statements the forward looking statements contained in this item and elsewhere in this annual report on form k are subject to various risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated in such forward looking statements 
included among the important risks  uncertainties and other factors are those hereinafter discussed 
few of the forward looking statements in this annual report deal with matters that are within our unilateral control 
joint venture  acquisition  financing and other agreements and arrangements must be negotiated with independent third parties and  in some cases  must be approved by governmental agencies 
these third parties generally have objectives and interests that may not coincide with ours and may conflict with our interests 
unless we are able to compromise these conflicting objectives and interests in a mutually acceptable manner  agreements and arrangements with these third parties will not be consummated 
operating entities in various foreign jurisdictions must be registered by governmental agencies  and production licenses for development of oil and gas fields in various foreign jurisdictions must be granted by governmental agencies 
these governmental agencies generally have broad discretion in determining whether to take or approve various actions and matters 
in addition  the policies and practices of governmental agencies may be affected or altered by political  economic and other events occurring either within their own countries or in a broader international context 
finally  due to the developing nature of the legal regimes in many former soviet union countries where we operate  our contractual rights and remedies may be subject to certain legal uncertainties 
we do not have a majority of the equity in the entity that is the licensed developer of some projects  that we may pursue in the former soviet union  even though we may be the designated operator of the oil or gas field 
in these circumstances  the concurrence of co venturers may be required for various actions 
other parties influencing the timing of events may have priorities that differ from ours  even if they generally share our objectives 
as a result of all of the foregoing  among other matters  any forward looking statements regarding the occurrence and timing of future events may well anticipate results that will not be realized 
demands by or expectations of governments  co venturers  customers and others may affect our strategy regarding the various projects 
failure to meet such demands or expectations could adversely affect our participation in such projects or our ability to obtain or maintain necessary licenses and other approvals 
our ability to finance all of its present oil and gas projects and other ventures according to present plans is dependent upon obtaining additional funding 
an inability to obtain financing could require us to scale back or abandon part of all of our project development  capital expenditure  production and other plans 
the availability of equity or debt financing to us or to the entities that are developing projects in which we have interests is affected by many factors  including world economic conditions  the state international relations  the stability and policies of various governments located in areas in which we currently operate or intend to operate  fluctuations in the price of oil and gas  the general outlook for the oil and gas industry and competition for available funds  and an evaluation of us and specific projects in which we have an interest 
rising interest rates might affect the feasibility of debt financing that is offered 
potential investors and lenders will be influenced by their evaluations of us and our projects and comparisons with alternative investment opportunities 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal exposure to market risk is due to changes in oil and gas prices and currency fluctuations 
as indicated elsewhere in this report  as a producer of oil and gas we are exposed to changes in oil and gas prices as well as changes in supply and demand which could affect our revenues 
we do not engage in any commodity hedging activities 
due to the ready market for our production in georgia  we do not believe that any current exposures from this risk will materially affect our financial position at this time  but there can be no assurance that changes in such market will not affect us adversely in the future 
also as indicated elsewhere in this report  because all of our operations are being conducted in the former soviet union  we are potentially exposed to the market risk of fluctuations in the relative values of the currencies in areas in which we operate 
at present we do not engage in any currency hedging operations since  to the extent we receive payments for our production and marketing activities in local currencies  we are utilizing such currencies to pay for our local operations 
in addition  our contracts to sell our production from the ninotsminda field in georgia is denominated in us dollars with all export contracts providing for payment in dollars  although we may not always be able to continue to demand payment in us dollars 
production from the kyzyloi field in kazakhstan will be delivered under a natural gas supply contract concluded between bnm and gaz impex in january with payment in us dollars 
we had no material interest in investments subject to market risk during the period covered by this report 
because the majority of all revenue to us is from the sale of production from the ninotsminda field a change in the price of oil or a change in the production rates could have a substantial effect on this revenue and therefore profits 
assuming the same production in as but decreasing the net oil price we receive from sales by and respectively would change the total annual revenue from oil sales as follows 
the total annual revenue from oil sales for based on an average net oil price received of was  if the average net oil price received was less at then the total annual revenue from oil sales would be reduced by  to  if the average net oil price received was reduced by per barrel then the total annual revenue from oil sales realised would be reduced by  to  assuming all other factors are constant 
assuming constant oil prices a reduction in annual production by and would have the following effect on total annual revenues 
in total oil sales were  bbls of oil producing revenue of  if this was reduced by then the annual revenue from oil sales would be reduced to  if the total annual oil sales were reduced by or  bbls then the total annual revenue from oil sales would be  assuming all other factors are constant
