this discussion and analysis should be read with  and is qualified in its entirety by  the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
our discussion should be read in conjunction with the forward looking statements risk factors disclosures included herein 
executive summary throughout  the company continued its strategy of growth initiatives and productivity improvements and embarked on a new merchandise refresher program and a new branding and advertising strategy  all of which we believe help us maintain a competitive differentiation within the shopping trip 
these strategies along with our unique store layout to offer our customers all the attractive elements of a discount dollar store  drug store and mass merchant under one roof 
by offering elements of all three types of businesses  we seek to provide our customer with a ten minute superstore experience in a smaller  easier and more convenient store layout 
for the full year of  the company opened new stores and closed stores 
the majority of our new store openings were in alabama  georgia  texas  north carolina and south carolina 
we did not enter into any new states during the year 
additionally  we opened new pharmacies and closed pharmacies during our merchandising refresher program was started in to revitalize our merchandise selection and presentation  and to refresh the look and feel of our stores with new paint and flooring  updated signage and the expansion of several departments 
as a means of exposing potential customers to our refreshed merchandise and stores  we began a new branding and advertising campaign in the second half of both the branding campaign and the advertising campaign were designed to remind our customers of our year history  as well as emphasize the new look and feel of fred s 
the new campaigns began in november with increased spending for both television and radio advertising 
both customer traffic and sales increased during the periods of additional advertising 
beginning with new stores coming on line in the second half of  we introduced our new store prototype  which changes our merchandise presentation by moving higher margin items to the front of the store and lower margin items to the back 
with our new store prototype and the refresher programs we believe the company is poised to increase customer traffic  gross margin and overall profitability 
during  the company continued to see paybacks on productivity improvements and key technology initiatives 
some of which include continuing enhancement of our point of sale and radio frequency rf store systems  refinement and upgrades to our merchandise planning and allocation systems and process and productivity standards improvements in our distribution centers 
pharmacy system improvements that enhance customer service also continue to be a key initiative 
in the company plans to increase operating margins by slowing new store growth  improving store productivity and closing unproductive stores 
we expect to open to new stores  to new pharmacies  and expect to close stores and pharmacies  with the net effect being an increase in selling space in the range of to 
we expect to achieve increased comparable store sales  driven by our merchandising and advertising programs discussed in the previous paragraphs 
the company plans to continue with capital improvements in infrastructure  including new store expansion  distribution center upgrades and further development of our information technology capabilities in key factors that we believe will be critical to the company s future success include managing the growth strategy for new stores and pharmacies  including the ability to open and operate effectively  maintaining high standards of customer service  
table of contents maximizing efficiencies in the supply chain  controlling working capital needs through improved inventory turnover  increasing the operating margin through improved gross profit margin and leveraging operating costs  and generating adequate cash flow to fund the company s expansion 
other factors that we expect to affect company performance in include the continuing management of the impacts of the implementation of medicare part d  which has a negative effect on gross margin with a partial positive offset from increasing part d scripts  market driven revisions of the generic pricing model  which negatively affects sales and gross margin  and the implementation of the federally approved change in pricing of generic pharmaceuticals to average manufacturer s price amp  which could negatively affect gross margin 
critical accounting policies the preparation of fred s financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments in the reporting of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are applicable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
while we believe that the historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the consolidated financial statements  the company cannot guarantee that the estimates and assumptions will be accurate under different conditions and or assumptions 
a summary of our critical accounting policies and related estimates and judgments  can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements and the most critical accounting policies are as follows inventories 
merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the retail first in  first out fifo method for goods in our stores and the cost first in  first out fifo method for goods in our distribution centers 
the retail inventory method is a reverse mark up  averaging method which has been widely used in the retail industry for many years 
this method calculates a cost to retail ratio that is applied to the retail value of inventory to determine the cost value of inventory and the resulting cost of goods sold and gross margin 
the assumption that the retail inventory method provides for valuation at lower of cost or market and the inherent uncertainties therein are discussed in the following paragraphs 
in order to assure valuation at the lower of cost or market  the retail value of our inventory is adjusted on a consistent basis to reflect current market conditions 
these adjustments include increases to the retail value of inventory for initial markups to set the selling price of goods or additional markups to adjust pricing for inflation and decreases to the retail value of inventory for markdowns associated with promotional  seasonal or other declines in the market value 
because these adjustments are made on a consistent basis and are based on current prevailing market conditions  they approximate the carrying value of the inventory at net realizable value market value 
therefore  the cost value of our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market as is prescribed by us gaap 
because the approximation of net realizable value market value under the retail inventory method is based on estimates such as markups  markdowns and inventory losses shrink there exists an inherent uncertainty in the final determination of inventory cost and gross margin 
in order to mitigate that uncertainty  the company has a formal review by product class which considers such variables as current market trends  seasonality  weather patterns and age of merchandise to ensure that markdowns are taken currently  or a markdown reserve is established to cover future anticipated markdowns 
this review also considers current pricing trends and inflation to ensure that markups are taken if necessary 
the estimation of inventory losses is a significant element in approximating the carrying value of inventory at net realizable value  and as such the following paragraph describes our estimation method as well as the steps we take to mitigate the risk of this estimate in the determination of the cost value of inventory 

table of contents the company calculates inventory losses shrink based on actual inventory losses occurring as a result of physical inventory counts during each fiscal period and estimated inventory losses occurring between yearly physical inventory counts 
the estimate for shrink occurring in the interim period between physical counts is calculated on a store specific basis and is based on history  as well as performance on the most recent physical count 
it is calculated by multiplying each store s shrink rate  which is based on the previously mentioned factors  by the interim period s sales for each store 
additionally  the overall estimate for shrink is adjusted at the corporate level to a three year historical average to ensure that the overall shrink estimate is the most accurate approximation of shrink based on the company s overall history of shrink 
the three year historical estimate is calculated by dividing the book to physical inventory adjustments for the trailing months by the related sales for the same period 
in order to reduce the uncertainty inherent in the shrink calculation  the company first performs the calculation at the lowest practical level by store using the most current performance indicators 
this ensures a more reliable number  as opposed to using a higher level aggregation or percentage method 
the second portion of the calculation ensures that the extreme negative or positive performance of any particular store or group of stores does not skew the overall estimation of shrink 
this portion of the calculation removes additional uncertainty by eliminating short term peaks and valleys that could otherwise cause the underlying carrying cost of inventory to fluctuate unnecessarily 
the company has not experienced any significant change in shrink as a percentage of sales from year to year during the subject reporting periods 
management believes that the company s retail inventory method provides an inventory valuation which reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market 
for pharmacy inventories  which were approximately million and million at february  and january   respectively  cost was determined using the retail lifo last in  first out method in which inventory cost is maintained using the retail inventory method  then adjusted by application of the producer price index published by the us department of labor for the cumulative annual periods 
the current cost of inventories exceeded the lifo cost by approximately million at february  and million at january  the lifo reserve increased by approximately million  million  and million  during   and  respectively 
exit and disposal activities 
during the year ended february   the company recorded a below cost inventory adjustment of approximately million associated with the discontinuance of the boys and girls apparel departments 
also the company recorded an additional below cost inventory adjustment of million for planned store closings 
both adjustments were recorded in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended february  the company also recorded approximately million in selling  general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended february  to reflect impairment charges for furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements relating to the planned store closures mentioned above 
impairment 
the company s policy is to review the carrying value of all long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review for impairment stores open or remodeled more than two years for which current cash flows from operations are negative 
impairment results when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows over the life of the lease 
our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows over the lease term is based upon historical operations of the stores and estimates of future store profitability which encompasses many factors that are subject to management s judgment and are difficult to predict 
if a long lived asset is found to be impaired  the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset s fair value 
the fair value is estimated based primarily upon future cash flows discounted at our credit adjusted risk free rate or other reasonable estimates of fair market value 

table of contents property and equipment and intangibles 
property and equipment are carried at cost 
depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets and recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
improvements to leased premises are amortized using the straight line method over the shorter of the initial term of the lease or the useful life of the improvement 
leasehold improvements added late in the lease term are amortized over the shorter of the remaining term of the lease including the upcoming renewal option  if the renewal is reasonably assured or the useful life of the improvement  whichever is lesser 
gains or losses on the sale of assets are recorded at disposal as a component of operating income 
the following average estimated useful lives are generally applied estimated useful lives building and building improvements years furniture  fixtures and equipment years leasehold improvements years or term of lease  if shorter automobiles and vehicles years airplane years assets under capital leases are amortized in accordance with the company s normal depreciation policy for owned assets or over the lease term regardless of renewal options  if shorter  and the charge to earnings is included in depreciation expense in the consolidated financial statements 
other identifiable intangible assets  which are included in other noncurrent assets  primarily represent customer lists associated with acquired pharmacies and are being amortized on a straight line basis over five years 
in  the company changed the estimated lives of certain store fixtures from five to ten years 
based upon the company s historical experience  ten years is a closer approximation of the actual lives of these assets 
the change in estimate was applied prospectively 
as a result of this change in estimate  depreciation expense was favorably impacted by approximately million pretax 
per diluted share  million pretax 
per diluted share  and million pretax 
per diluted share for the fiscal years   and  respectively 
vendor rebates and allowances 
the company receives rebates for a variety of merchandising activities  such as volume commitment rebates  relief for temporary and permanent price reductions  cooperative advertising programs  and for the introduction of new products in our stores 
in accordance with the emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf  rebates received from a vendor are recorded as a reduction of cost of sales when the product is sold or a reduction to selling  general and administrative expenses if the reimbursement represents a specific incremental and identifiable cost 
should the allowance received exceed the incremental cost  then the excess is recorded as a reduction of cost of sales when the product is sold 
any excess amounts for the periods reported are immaterial 
any rebates received subsequent to merchandise being sold are recorded as a reduction to cost of goods sold when received 
as of february   the company had approximately vendors who participate in vendor rebate programs and the terms of the agreements with those vendors vary in length from short term arrangements to be completed within three months to longer term arrangements that could last up to three years 
in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position no 
 reporting on advertising costs aicpa sop  the company charges advertising  including production costs  to selling  general and administrative expense on the first day of the advertising period 
gross advertising expenses for   and  were million  million  and million  respectively 
gross advertising expenses were reduced by vendor cooperative advertising allowances of million  
million  and 
million for   and  respectively 
it would be the company s intention to incur a similar amount 
table of contents of advertising expense as in prior years and in support of our stores even if we did not receive support from our vendors in the form of cooperative adverting programs 
insurance reserves 
the company is largely self insured for workers compensation  general liability and employee medical insurance 
the company s liability for self insurance is determined based on claims known at the time of determination of the reserve and estimates for future payments against incurred losses and claims that have been incurred but not reported 
estimates for future claims costs include uncertainty because of the variability of the factors involved  such as the type of injury or claim  required services by the providers  healing time  age of claimant  case management costs  location of the claimant  and governmental regulations 
these uncertainties or a deviation in future claims trends from recent historical patterns could result in the company recording additional expenses or expense reductions that might be material to the company s results of operations 
the company carries additional coverage for excessive or catastrophic claims with stop loss limits of  for property and general liability and  for employee medical 
the company s insurance reserve was million and million on february  and january   respectively 
changes in the reserve over that time period were attributable to additional reserve requirements of million netted with reserve utilization of million 
stock based compensation 
effective january   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this method  compensation expense recognized in includes compensation expense for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 and compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
in november  the financial accounting standards board issued staff position no 
fas r  transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards fsp fas r 
effective january   the company has elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided in fsp fas r for calculating the income tax effects of stock based compensation pursuant to sfas r 
the alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool apic pool related to the income tax effects of stock based compensation  and for determining the subsequent impact on the apic pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the income tax effects of stock based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of sfas r 
stock based compensation expense  post adoption of sfas r  is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  and therefore has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant based on the company s historical forfeiture experience and will be revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the current forfeiture estimate for stock options is and for restricted stock is 
for periods prior to  the company in its proforma disclosures under sfas  recognized forfeitures as they occurred 
for the year ended february   the adoption of sfas r fair value method resulted in share based expense a component of selling and general and administrative expenses in the amount of million before income taxes and consisted of stock option  espp and restricted stock expense of million  
million and 
million  respectively 
the related total income tax benefit was 
million 
prior to january   the company accounted for share based payments using the intrinsic value based recognition method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb 
as stock options were granted at an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant  no stock option compensation expense was reflected in net income prior to adopting sfas r 

table of contents as a result of adopting sfas r  the company s income before income taxes and net income for fiscal year  were million and million lower  respectively  than if it had continued to account for share based compensation under apb basic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal year were 
and 
lower respectively  than if the company had continued to account for share based compensation under apb sfas r also requires the benefits of income tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required prior to sfas r 
the impact of adopting sfas r on future results will depend on  among other things  levels of share based payments granted in the future  actual forfeiture rates and the timing of option exercises 
the following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share for the years ended january  and january  as if the company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r to stock based employee compensation 
amounts in thousands  except per share data net income  as reported less sfas no 
pro forma compensation expense  net of income taxes sfas n pro forma net income basic earnings per share as reported pro forma diluted earnings per share as reported pro forma amounts for the year ended february  are not presented in this table because those amounts were recorded in accordance with sfas no 
r and are recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
the amounts in this table have been adjusted from the amounts reported in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended january  to be calculated following the same method that has been utilized under sfas no 
r 
the total impact of the change was to increase the incremental stock option expense per sfas no 
r  net of taxes by 
million and 
million for fiscal years and  respectively 
the company uses the modified black scholes option valuation model bsm to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
the bsm was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options  which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock volatility and option 
table of contents life 
because the company s employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion  the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options 
the fair value of each option granted is estimated on the date of grant using the bsm with the following weighted average assumptions pro forma pro forma stock options expected volatility risk free interest rate expected option life in years expected dividend yield weighted average fair value at grant date employee stock purchase plan expected volatility risk free interest rate expected option life in years expected dividend yield weighted average fair value at grant date the following is a summary of the methodology applied to develop each assumption expected volatility this is a measure of the amount by which a price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate 
the company uses actual historical changes in the market value of our stock to calculate expected price volatility because management believes that this is the best indicator of future volatility 
the company calculates weekly market value changes from the date of grant over a past period representative of the expected life of the options to determine volatility 
an increase in the expected volatility will increase compensation expense 
risk free interest rate this is the yield of a us treasury zero coupon bond issue effective at the grant date with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option 
an increase in the risk free interest rate will increase compensation expense 
expected lives this is the period of time over which the options granted are expected to remain outstanding and is based on historical experience 
options granted have a maximum term of seven and one half years 
an increase in the expected life will increase compensation expense 
dividend yield this is based on the historical yield for a period equivalent to the expected life of the option 
an increase in the dividend yield will decrease compensation expense 
forfeiture rate this is the estimated percentage of options granted that are expected to be forfeited or cancelled before becoming fully vested 
this estimate is based on historical experience 
an increase in the forfeiture rate will decrease compensation expense

 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement standards no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
requires the company to display the net over or under funded position of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability  with any unrecognized prior service costs  transition obligations or actuarial gains losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity

results of operations the following table provides a comparison of fred s financial results for the past three years 
in this table  categories of income and expense are expressed as a percentage of sales 
for the year ended february  january  january  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense  net income before taxes income taxes net income cost of goods sold includes the cost of the product sold  along with all costs associated with inbound freight 
selling  general and administrative expenses include the costs associated with purchasing  receiving  handling  securing  and storing product 
these costs are associated with products that have been sold and no longer remain in ending inventory 
comparable sales our policy regarding the calculation of comparable store sales represents the increase or decrease in net sales for stores that have been opened after the end of the twelfth month following the store s grand opening month  including stores that have been remodeled or relocated during the reporting period 
the majority of our remodels and relocations do not include expansion 
the purpose of the remodel or the relocation is to change the store s layout  refresh the store with new fixtures  interiors or signage or to locate the store in a more desirable area 
this type of change to the store does not necessarily change the product mix or product departments  therefore  on a comparable store sales basis  the store is the same before and after the remodel or relocation 
in relation to remodels and relocations  expansions have been much more infrequent and consequently  any increase in the selling square footage is immaterial to the overall calculation of comparable store sales 

table of contents additionally  we do not exclude newly added hardline  softline or pharmacy departments from our comparable store sales calculation because we believe that all departments within a fred s store create a synergy supporting our overall goals for managing the store  servicing our customer and promoting traffic and sales growth
