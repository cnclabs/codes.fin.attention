item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discontinued operations 
if we incur additional unanticipated expenses associated with the discontinuation of our implement product line  then our net income could be adversely affected in future periods 
our leverage could adversely affect our financial health and make us vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions 
at times  we may incur indebtedness that is substantial relative to our shareholders equity 
our indebtedness has important consequences 
for example  it could make it difficult for us to fulfill our obligations under our credit agreement  make it more challenging for us to obtain additional financing to fund our business strategy  debt service requirements  capital expenditures and working capital  increase our vulnerability to interest rate changes and general adverse economic and industry conditions  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  research and development efforts and other general corporate activities  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and markets  and place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors that have less debt 
in addition  our credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests  which may require that we take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our long term business objectives 
we are subject to risks and associated changes in the business climate that could limit our access to capital 
our business is capital intensive and the fulfillment of our strategic plan depends  at least in part  upon our ability to access capital at attractive rates and terms 
if access to capital becomes significantly constrained because of changes in the business climate or other factors  then our results of operations and financial condition could be significantly adversely affected 
we are subject to significant environmental  health and safety laws and regulations and related compliance expenditures and liabilities 
we are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety and have incurred and will continue to incur capital and other expenditures to comply with these regulations 
if we fail to comply with any environmental regulations  then we could be subject to future liabilities  fines or penalties or the suspension of production at our manufacturing facilities 
if unexpected obligations at these or other sites or more stringent environmental laws are imposed in the future  our future profitability may be adversely affected

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and materially impact the carrying value of the assets and liabilities 
the company believes the following accounting policies are critical to the company s business operations and the understanding of the company s results of operations and financial condition 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company s accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may be uncollectible in the future 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against the accounts receivable balance to reduce the amount due to the net amount reasonably expected to be collected 
additionally  a general percentage of outstanding receivables is reserved  based on the company s past experience of collectibility 
if circumstances change ie  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations  estimates of the recoverability of amounts due could be reduced by a material amount 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined using the last in  first out lifo method for the majority of the company s inventories 
in valuing inventory  management is required to make assumptions regarding the level of reserves required to value potentially obsolete or slow moving items to the lower of cost or market value 
inventory reserves are established taking into account inventory age and frequency of use or sale 
while calculations are made involving these factors  significant management judgment regarding expectations for future events is involved 
future events that could significantly influence management s judgment and related estimates include general economic conditions in markets where the company s products are sold  as well as new products and design changes introduced by the company 
accrued warranty the company establishes reserves related to the warranties provided on its products 
specific reserves are maintained for programs related to known machine safety and reliability issues 
when establishing specific reserves  estimates are made regarding the size of the population  the type of program  costs to be incurred and estimated participation 
additionally  general reserves are maintained based on the historical percentage relationships of warranty costs to machine sales and applied to current equipment sales 
if these estimates and related assumptions change  reserve levels may require adjustment 
accrued product liability the company records a general reserve for potential product liability claims based on the company s prior claim experience and specific reserves for known product liability claims 
specific reserves for known claims are valued based upon the company s prior claims experience  including consideration of the jurisdiction  circumstances of the accident  type of loss or injury  identity of plaintiff  other potential responsible parties  analysis of outside counsel  and analysis of internal product liability counsel 
actual product liability costs could be different due to a number of variables  including decisions of juries or judges 
goodwill impairment in connection with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company is required to perform goodwill impairment reviews  at least annually  using a fair value based approach 
the company performs its annual impairment review as of december as part of the annual impairment review  an estimate of the fair value of the company  primarily by using a discounted cash flow analysis  is performed 
significant assumptions used in this analysis include expected future revenue growth rates  operating profit margins  working capital levels and a weighted average cost of capital 
changes in assumptions could significantly impact the estimate of the fair value of the company  which could result in a goodwill impairment charge and could have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements
